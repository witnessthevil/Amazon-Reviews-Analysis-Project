It's an incredibly difficult game that actually requires strategy, observation, and successful manipulation of the sometimes awkward and clunky controls.  Given that there's no difficulty settings to adjust that would make the game a bit more accessible to newcomers, it blatantly caters to the hardcore gaming crowd who have lightning-fast reflexes and are able to find obscure solutions to get past the levels.  However, despite all of these issues, it's still a rip-roaring good time as you bust out all sorts of sick moves to lay waste to hundreds and hundreds of bad guys.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"Decker","summary":"Calling in air strikes and care packages before it was cool","reviewText":"Rest in peace Pandemic, they made a lot of good games before they were gutted by EA. Mercenaries Playground of Destruction was one of them and is one of the most satisfying open-world sandbox games ever made. For me it falls under the same category that Saint's Row and Prototype fall under. Lack of story is no biggie because its packed to the brim with content and wanton destruction. The title \"Playground of Destruction\" really fits the game well since it seems just about every building can be leveled with enough explosives. So the underlying synopsis is as, General Song the military dictator of the un-Democratic People's Republic of Korea is exposed for selling nuclear weapons illegally. As the UN and South Korea move into oust him from power he goes underground with his cabinet and precious nukes. The North Korean military is waging a tenacious guerrilla war against the Allies and time is running out. So bounties are placed on General Song and his men to hasten their capture. Now ExOps, a private military contractor sends in one of their agents to cash in on the war.So at the start you are given a choice of several agents to play as. You have Chris Jacobs the American, Jennifer Mui the Brit, and Mattias Nilsson a Swedish-BA. The game says that they all have different strengths and weaknesses but in reality they don't make much of a difference. So what you really end up choosing is skin and dialogue. After you got your agent your dropped off in war torn North Korea and now begins the hunt for the \"Deck of 52\". The bounties are split up by card numbers and suits and you capture them (dead or alive) till you eventually get up to the man himself. To do this you can track down the smaller bounties on your own or gain intelligence from the various factions in Korea. Aside from the Allies; there are the South Koreans, the Chinese, and the Russian Mafia. You can work with these factions who in turn toss a fat bounty at you and information on others in hiding so as long as you do their bidding. Supporting them also opens up their resources to you, support the South Koreans you get their air support, support the Chinese you get artillery support and armor, the Russians Mob gives you small arms and contraband vehicles etc etc. However at times they can work against each other and you may end up making enemies of one faction in the process.The missions they toss at you are pretty typical in regards to sandbox games. Go there blow that building up, go here and take that guy out and so on. Though its not really the missions that you should come for but the destruction. Virtually every vehicle can be hijacked and it helps give you an edge. If a North Korean tank is rushing to you why not just hijack it and use it against them? Thats possible and more. You can slap C4 on a car and drive it into the checkpoint and detonate it in the process. If you are stuck in the middle of nowhere call in your Mafia comrades to pick you up with a captured Blackhawk helicopter. Thats another thing that makes this game really enjoyable is the \"Merchants of Menace\" site attached to your character's PDA. With it you can call in air strikes, supplies, or vehicles which are promptly delivered. Since the site is ran by the Russian Mafia its best to stay on their good side for discounts if you plan to use it frequently. Be careful with the M&M; app though because you may end up burning through all your money fast.This game is over 8 years old but still looks good. Dust rises up from explosions, missiles leave behind lines of exhaust, sunlight glistens off surfaces, and destroyed vehicles shower fiery debris. Battles are large scale and you'll often find two factions fighting hashing it out complete with tanks, helicopters and infantry charging at each other. If you use heavy types of air strikes like carpet bombing or fuel air bombs what was once a vibrant armor base is leveled flat into charred ruins. Looking back its quite amazing what they were able to pull of visually despite having dated hardware. So in the end the game was fun, and it's still fun. The game-play itself if very satisfying and rewards adventuring. Difficulty can definitely spike in certain missions but with some imagination most missions in this game are doable. Overall, great game and worth getting a used copy of.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"Yo ho ho and a bottle o' adventure!","reviewText":"Full disclaimer: I went into this game with no prior experience or knowledge in the Assassin's Creed series.  I've heard about the game, but I didn't know what genre the game fell in much less any of the previous plots or gameplay elements.  I picked this game up on a whim, and I'm so glad I did!  The pirate-filled story is rich with thrilling adventure, the gameplay is nearly as smooth as butter, and the graphics and music leave nothing to be desired.  This is going to be a very lengthy, in-depth review, so hang on to your eyepatch and prepare to walk the plank!STORY - The Past - The setting is 18th century Caribbean, full of freedom-seeking pirates and power-hungry rulers.  Edward Kenway is introduced into the story as a man wanting to pave a life of luxury for himself and for his family.  His wife doesn't have faith in his pursuit and returns to her parents, while he turns to the open waters to prove himself as a provider who has the ability to gain riches and prestige from his fellow men.  His journeys eventually lead him to finding out about a mysterious place called The Observatory, hidden away from men due to its immense power.  It's rumored to give any man unlimited prosperity and influence, but only a certain sage knows how to access it.  As Edward seeks to discover this secret location, he is drawn into a major war between templars and assassin's.  Edward's selfish greed causes even more problems between the two factions, but will it also lead to his undoing?The Present - You play as yourself, taking a new job at Abstergo Entertainent.  You are testing out this new technology that allows you to access Edward Kenway's memories and discover what happened during his life as a pirate.  Although Abstergo claims to be using this footage you collect to create entertainment for the masses, one of the employees insists they are up to no good and enlists your aid to hack into Abstergo's programming and find out the truth.You will encounter the present-day story arc very infrequently in your gameplay, as it only exists about 4-5 times at certain points in the main past gameplay, and each experience is only about 10-15 minutes long.  However, you have the ability to shut off Edward's memories at any time and explore the Abstergo offices as yourself even when you aren't advancing the story.  There are plenty of secrets hidden in the hallways and cubicles at Abstergo to keep you entertained a few hours outside of the main pirate gameplay.The story is really rather ingenious and unfolds at the perfect pace.  There is always something thrilling happening, full of adventure and intrigue.  I do wish the story were a little bit less linear, and I don't mean that there weren't many side quests for you to focus on aside from the main story; there were literally hundreds of those.  I mean that I wish there had been some moral choices that would have affected which path the story would take.  You as a player are always told what to do, and while there are often different ways to achieve your goals, once achieved, the results are always the same.I also found the story so brilliantly convoluted that it got a bit confusing at times.  It seems to expect that players have previous knowledge of the Assassin's Creed series, the templars, and Abstergo.  While I still was able to basically follow the story; I did feel like I missed a bit of backstory that I would probably have had I played the previous titles.In addition, there are so many characters that it often gets confusing who is who.  While you'll never forget Blackbeard, you might forget the different between Roberts and Rogers or the various other men who look nearly identical.  I wish there were more distinctions between characters to keep them definitely separate.Finally, without giving away spoilers, I want to mention that the ending is beautiful and perfectly-written.  It's one of those ending that will affect you emotionally, much like the ending of a great movie.Despite the minor deficiencies I mentioned, the story is still absolutely enthralling to be a part of, and I was constantly eager to find out what would happen next!  This was a game that had me thinking about it even when I wasn't playing it, and that is a sign of an incredible game.GAMEPLAY - Before I get drawn into the vast detail of the main gameplay, let me quickly note how gameplay works in the present-day Abstergo story arc.  It's 1st person, and you move around with a tablet device acting as your map and menu.  You usually complete minigames (such as one resembling Frogger) in order to hack computer and discover information about Abstergo Entertainment.The main gameplay with Edward is drastically different!  It's 3rd person and divided nearly halfway between on land activity and on water missions.  When you're on land, you are able to run around the beaches, forests, and marshes evading or fighting foes while stealthily stalking your targets.  Edward is a very agile man and is able to climb and leap from rooftops, trees, rocks, shipwrecks, and nearly anything that he can hang from.  When it is time for him to fight, he can use his fists or swords for melee combat, or he can attack from afar with pistols or his blowgun.  Main chunks of the gameplay require you to trail enemies or even eavesdrop on them, so action isn't always a large part of the game.  These scenes are just as tense, though, since they require strategic yet quick planning on where to hide in order to avoid being seen.Your adventures on water can be just as stealthy, with you needing to avoid enemy ships spotting you as you sail into restricted territory, or you may also be called upon to tail a ship and see where it's heading.  More habitual are the naval battles that you will engage in.  They differ much from the land fights since you are exchanging pistols and swords for cannons and explosive fire barrels.  Coordinating your sailing, steering, and aiming can be tricky, but being able to do all three at once is crucial for winning these battles.There's a bit of a learning curve if you're new to games such as this like I was, and there aren't many hand holding tutorials to help you out.  Immersing yourself in the gameplay is the best way to become accustomed to it, and the developers did a great job of starting you off slowly in the beginning with limited combat.There are loading screen occasionally but only between major plot progressions or quick traveling between locations.  They never last long, and I never got annoyed with them since they're somewhat interactive.Glitches were a bit more frequent than I would have liked, but they were never too crazy drastic.  Characters (both Edward and NPCs) got stuck in rocks, and I was forced to restart the memory; rain would sometime come down even when Edward was in a house;  people would vanish after their purpose in the story was complete; and lag would occur occasionally during certain cutscenes.  The rock glitch was the most frustrating, but it never interrupted my gameplay too horribly.Multiplayer is only available online with an Xbox Live account, which I was disappointed with.  I was hoping for an offline local multiplayer with friends, but that's no supported.  Since I don't have an Xbox Live account, I can't really speak for multiplayer, so I recommend checking other reviews on Amazon, since many of them have experience in this area.The game utilizes and autosave feature which works wonderfully; I never had a problem with how the game was saved when I would quit for the day.There isn't much else to say about gameplay other than to stress that aside from the glitches, everything ran smoothly and professionally.  The nearly flawless gameplay allowed me to lose myself in the game that much more, and I enjoyed every second of it.GRAPHICS/SOUND - The graphics are breathtaking in this title.  Everything from the trees to the waves are detailed beautifully.  No texture went untouched by the graphic artists; it's obvious that a lot of love and care went into this game's world.  Admittedly, the Abstergo offices occasionally looked a little thrown together last minute, but they aren't explored enough for that to be a negative.The music is gorgeous; I would love to listen to a soundtrack of this game in my spare time.  One of the side quests in this game is to collect shanties, which your pirates will then sing as you're sailing the ocean blue.  I have to admit that they were often quite catchy and really added to atmosphere of this game.The voice acting was probably the most perfect aspect of Assassin's Creed IV.  Every character seemed 100% real, and the voice actor's truly gave these roles their everything.  Even the minor characters are extremely well done, and I genuinely loved listening to each accent as presented.WARNINGS - The title is rated M, and that's for good reason.  It's obvious why the phrase \"curse like a sailor exists.\"  Many F bombs are dropped during the game in addition to some other four letter words that shall go by unnamed.  Nothing sexually graphic happens, but there is heavy insinuation in addition to brothels scattered around.  Alcohol usage is a must with pirates, and it's heavily used.  Violence is obviously nearly constantly happening, and it's never very pretty.LENGTH/REPLAY VALUE - It took me about 30 hours to complete the main story, and I will definitely be spending many more finishing up side quests.  I probably won't be replaying the game just because the story is so linear, but I don't mind since the game was so long.  I will definitely be checking out other games in the series, though.OVERALL - I've fallen in love with this game.  I'm not going to say it's perfect, but it's a beautiful game that's a lot of fun to play.  I recommend it to adventure lovers and invite all ye landlubbers to give it a try!  It's worth every dollar you'll spend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

RAGE attempts to incorporate both on-foot shooting and third-person buggy-driving combat as part of an \"open-world\" concept. Its setting is heavily based on Mad Max and other post-apocalyptic standards; following a comet strike on the Earth, the surviving humans basically turned into the cliche division of honest settlers and evil raiders in football gear. Really, there's not much more of an explanation beyond that: you play an individual with special technology who was locked into a survival pod before the comet hit, and when you emerge there's \"raiders and stuff\".A low-story game isn't a bad thing - that allows it to focus on gameplay, after all. However, despite their barely developed setting, the game insists on trying to shove story in where it doesn't belong. The game advances primarily through doing quests, and doing quests basically means going to talk to someone before going to the next \"shoot everyone on this linear path\" dungeon. The story is incredibly lackluster (the good guys are named the \"resistance\" and the bad guys are named the \"authority\", and there's no real explanation why one's good and the other's evil), and really it just serves as an obstacle to shooting things. In one case I was doing a quest so that I could do a quest so that I could do a quest - three nested quests for one routine mission. They're the usual fetch-quests and \"go kill everyone in this building\" quests, but they seem ultimately pointless.To be fair, when the game does get to the shooting, it's pretty decent. There's two main kinds of enemies: humans and mutants. Humans mostly use guns and grenades, meaning that fighting them involves using cover and tactics. Mutants rush headlong with claws and occasionally slow-moving projectiles, which means that fighting mutants is much more fast-paced. Human enemies have a lot of variety in design terms (different gangs and so on), but not so much in actual combat terms. The game's occasional bosses are more gimmicky than reflexive; the one that stands out the most clearly is a giant mutant who targets you with highly visible attacks while you shoot at him with an infinite-ammo rocket launcher.There's a decent, if standard, collection of guns in the game, including pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rocket launchers, and so on. Each weapon also has three types of ammo, which provides some diversity. None of the guns were really worth getting excited about; the crossbow's mind-control bolts are the only vaguely unique thing, and all they let you do is blow up one guy. The rest of the ammo types are either \"does more damage to x enemy\" or something simple like exploding ammo or lightning ammo. One element that mixes it up a bit is the presence of support items. These items include basic things like medkits and grenades, but also encompass more advanced tech like radio-controlled explosive cars, sentry guns, and deployable robots. One such item, the \"wingstick\", is a razor-sharp boomerang that serves as the game's main logo. These items are relatively interesting and add some variety to the run-and-gun process.The other main part of the game is the driving segments. Over the course of the game you will obtain buggies of various kinds which can be used to drive from area to area (you can also walk, but naturally it takes longer). Buggies can be upgraded with better engines, armor, weapons, and so on by winning races. The vehicle combat is fairly solid, although it's more of an obstacle than anything - you're trying to get somewhere, there's some enemy buggies in your way, kill them. It might be more interesting if the world was actually open, but it's not. RAGE's world is a winding set of paths with a few branches; there's no real exploration because every interesting place is eventually a mandatory quest point. At one point I found a mortar outside an enemy base and was curious about it; it turned out to be a quest item like five minutes later. Everything interesting is something pre-planned, and there's not a lot of \"hey I found something pretty cool\" moments. The game has crafting based on ingredients you can find around the world, but the linear maps means that \"finding ingredients\" means progressing forward and grabbing everything you see.RAGE has multiplayer of several kinds, including shooting deathmatches, driving deathmatches, and co-op missions. It seems strange that the main campaign doesn't have cooperative play, only isolated challenges do. The game's graphics are decent but uninspired, drawing upon a tired array of post-apocalyptic concepts with the occasional steampunk or Wild West imagery thrown in for good measure. The music, however, was definitely a letdown. The game actually becomes way more enjoyable if you throw on some rock-and-roll or anything fast-paced, because the game's shooting action doesn't exactly match up with the slow, meandering soundtrack.Overall, RAGE wasn't a good game. It was a chore to push through, and the decent shooting doesn't make up for what a bore it is. If it had JUST been shooting, maybe it would have been okay, but the incredibly forced questing and the laughable world bog down the core gameplay by a huge amount. 5/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

Weir","summary":"Fun, but Repetitive","reviewText":"I avoided this game when it first came out because of all the horror stories I'd read about how it runs on PC. I recently picked this up super discounted from a certain service that rhymes with 'cream'. So how does it run nearly a year later?  Well, flawlessly for me. I running a decent PC - GTX 570 and overclocked i2500k with 16 GB of memory - Runs Rage maxed out (only using 4x AA but I think it goes up to 16) at 1080p with nary a frame rate drop or stutter. Hasn't crashed or frozen, and no issues with texture streaming/loading. It's a beautiful game too, though some of the textures look bad up close - nothing I've never seen before.When you're not driving upgradable buggies and off-road trucks in the desert, you're in various settlements talking to people, gathering up quests, upgrading your arsenal of weapons, crafting stuff (auto turrets, exploding remote control cars, temporary buffs, etc), competing in races and buying and selling ammo and supplies. And when you're not doing that the game will occasionally tell you to go somewhere and shoot stuff in the face. The thing is, you spend a lot of time in Rage NOT shooting which is unfortunate because the shooting in this game is classic id software crazyness: lots of circle strafing avoiding slowish moving projectiles, bashing enemies that get close to you and blowing stuff apart with shotguns (among other weapons). Fans of Doom will feel right at home with the shooting. And just like Doom, you'll go in a room, throw a switch, and enemies will overwhelm you. Often.The game is too long for its own good unfortunately. The formula of go to X settlement, talk to X person, deliver X goods, return to questgiver or go to X enemy camp, kill X guy or gather X part, return to town gets old a few hours in and the game is rather lengthy for how repetitive it becomes. However for $10 or whatever I paid for it, it's a steal. It's part Borderlands, part Fallout 3 and part Doom. All great games. Try it, you might like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2012"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A unique, sometimes exhilarating, flawed game","reviewText":"There is no other game out there quite like Mirror's Edge.  While the story may be somewhat routine, the gameplay is anything but.  Set in a dystopian future, you play as Faith.  Faith is a runner, the last bastion of free communication in a society where information sharing is controlled by the government.  Constantly being pursued by the authorities, runners relay messages from one point to another on foot.  And this is what forms the core of Mirror's Edge.  This is a game about running, climbing, and platforming, all in the first person perspective.Let me get this out of the way.  Mirror's Edge has flaws.  The major flaw in the game is the controls.  They don't work the way they should 100% of the time.  Especially later in the game when Faith has to perform some complex stunts, you will very likely find yourself not executing the move correctly, and then dying and having to reload.  Reload times are very fast, and checkpoints are generous, but it can make for a frustrating experience sometimes.  Even if you are pressing the button/analog stick combination the exact way you are supposed to, you won't always be successful.  This is a game that you have to have patience with.  I stuck with it, and although I had some very frustrating moments in the last two levels of the game, I'm glad that I did.  There was more than enough here to keep me going.  But this has to be mentioned and reflected in my review score.  Mirror's Edge is not only a first-of-its-kind game, but it was also an early game in this console generation (released in 2008), so the game's ideas may have been slightly beyond the ability for execution at the time.  Again, I'm not trying to make excuses for the game, but gamers should be aware of these issues.  Also, although it is not necessary to pick up firearms and shoot at the authorities, the option is there, and again, the shooting controls are quite poor.  Shooting is NOT a core element of Mirror's Edge's gameplay, but if you plan on playing this game as a shooter, you should look elsewhere.When Mirror's Edge works (and it does work most of the time), the game can be brilliant.  Running through that frightening, yet strangely beautiful, primary-colored city can be an experience like none other in gaming.  Leaping from rooftop to rooftop, executing a perfect wall jump, or launching a kick to a policeman's face from a zip line;  the things you can do in this game are exhilarating.  Mirror's Edge does things with movement that I've never seen done in a game before, and the game is well worth playing for these moments.  You'll feel the vertigo as Faith leaps from one crane arm to another, with thousands of feet separating the bottoms of her shoes from the streets below.  You'll cringe as she has a rough landing on a rooftop, and you'll tense up as she hangs from a ledge on the side of a skyscraper.  Mirror's Edge is as in-your-face as games get, and as I mentioned, these moments really make the game.Finally, I have to mention this game's soundtrack, which is one of the best of any game from the last 5 years, and plays a huge role in forming this game's atmosphere.  For those of you who are fans of the classic Tom Tykwer film \"Run Lola Run\", you'll have an even greater appreciation for Mirror's Edge, as this game's soundtrack perfectly suits the fast-paced subject matter, just like that film's soundtrack did.Mirror's Edge may have been ahead of it's time.  It's a game that is bursting with ideas, and it's a game that is truly innovative.  I wanted to love Mirror's Edge, but in the end, it's a game that I like, admire, and shake my head at when I think about what could have been.  If you are a patient, and somewhat skilled gamer that is looking for something unlike you've ever seen before, I heartily recommend the game.  In the meantime, I will eagerly be awaiting Mirror's Edge 2, which is looking very likely to release in the future.  A complete manifestation of Mirror's Edge's ideas into a fully-developed, smoother game will surely be the highlight of whatever year it releases.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

On several occasions this came causes the PS4's version of the blue screen death - the game crashes, inexplicably. The severity of the crashes has left me at times with a simple restart of the application and continuing from the nearest checkpoint, to restarting from the first mission because my save data was lost. It became practice to backup my save data, which something I never had to do for a game.The game is graphically superior in every way to Call of Duty. The campaign is short, but shows off the potential of the Frostbite 3 engine. The battles are huge. The AI is interesting - at times it is slopping with the enemy firing in the direction of its allies, at other times it is dormant and appears as if they are hiding, I do not know if this is a triggering failure or if the enemies on the field reduce to one or two, they take a more tactical &#34;come and find me, I'll be waiting&#34; approach (camping). The vehicle combat in single player is great, although the tank sequence seems unfairly difficult. The plot is not there, in fact, it doesn't make sense. Why China is waging all out war on a single US Navy vessel is up to figure out, and why the Russians are involved is beyond me... They had an idea, and then forgot to include key parts. Squad control is a gimmick as you only push one button to direct fire, that is it (not impressive). What is interesting is that you can choose whatever guns you want as weapon crates, and you unlock weapons either by finding them on enemies or completing scoring objectives or other objectives in missions. This is fun; reminds of the scoring scheme from Call of Duty 4.Online multiplayer is good for team deathmatch, I am not a fan beyond that. It is an embarrassment for their multiplayer development team that the user interface isn't better. If I am not mistaken, Call of Duty cannot copyright weapon loadout customization and match making menus... You must be in a menu either outside of combat and matchmaking all together or in a match itself (while it is happening) to change your weapons. It has been this way for a while with EA titles (Medal of Honor, Battlefield 3, and now this game) and it is not pleasant. I prefer Call of Duty multiplayer simply because of the interface and ease of getting in and out of matches (and not to mention UI subtleties like you KDA in the upper right hand corning). Vehicular combat is present, and with expansion content ($) you can access all of it.This game had potential, but blew it. It is not worth a $60, $50, or $40 investment.

The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are.

The Dreamcast was pretty awesome, but when it came down to the Nintendo 64, Playstation 1 & 2, and the Xbox all together, it seems like SEGA couldn't keep up with them, as the company began to turn into a third-party developer/publisher. So what do they do? THEY MAKE A SONIC GAME ON THE NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE (With publishing help from THQ)! How cool is that?! Sonic has arrived onto a Nintendo system! Sure, Sonic Adventure 2 on the Gamecube may have technically been his Nintendo debut for us, but Sonic Advance was a whole new game. And even better: It was 2D Sonic fun.Sonic Advance featured what made the Sega Genesis games so great and added a much faster pace to it. Fortunately, that did not ruin the flow of the game's oh-so-great platforming. In fact, the level design itself is flat-out brilliant, as it's generally multilayered, allowing Sonic and co. to travel through many different pathways. There's also a lot of variety of obstacles and enemies, some of which are exclusive to the environments the levels take place in (Such as casino pinball flippers, ziplines, etc), keeping the game fresh and fun.Being able to play as different characters also adds to what you can do in the game. For example, Sonic can somersault and perform a move in which a flash shaped like lightning will cover Sonic for a split second (a la Sonic 3 & Knuckles). Tails can fly and attack with his....tails. Knuckles can climb, glide, and punch. Lastly, Amy uses her hammer to attack. All of what the characters can do affect gameplay within the game and could possibly make things more satisfying to the player. For example, reaching areas with Tails or Knuckles could make the game a bit easier, but not to the point where the whole game's a cakewalk.All in all, Sonic Advance is awesome! Definitely get it for your Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS (Lite). The mobile version is also pretty neat, but some levels have been cut from that version, so it's best if you get yourself a copy of the game for the GBA or DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Don't listen to anyone, not even me","reviewText":"This game has gotten a bit of a strange reception since its release last week and I'll tell you, it makes no sense to me. All I can do is tell you what I did and didn't like about the game plus my personal overall opinion about the title.To keep it short, the game is, in my honest opinion, one of the best titles to be released for the Xbox 360 this year. Not only that, I'd even go so far as to say that this installment of the Halo series has the best or at least, the most entertaining story to date of any single one. It plays like a noir film set in a sci-fi future universe, complete with dark streets, neon lights, tall skyscrapers and a mystery to be solved. It manages to be its own entity in a world that most people associate Master Chief with as its main focus of what makes the series such a success. I found this story to be the easiest to follow and enjoyed my time spent with the characters in the story. You get to spend a bit of time with each one in segments that present some pretty intense battles in varying locales and scenarios. It's a Halo game through and through, the one difference this time being that you're not gonna feel so invincible  'cause you're not a Spartan. I really enjoyed the story and thought it fit very well and not as an eyesore on the rest of the Halo timeline. And playing it over Live with three other players in co-op makes it even more enjoyable. The voice acting is well done and its cool to see Nathan Fillion of Firefly fame putting in some screentime as the game's main character (of sorts). I'd also like to say, this one has some of the best music in the series. My hats off to the Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori for putting together a score that I already own.Control is typical Halo sans dual wielding. You do get to carry more grenades and employ a pretty nice accessory in the form of a visor that gives the player an advantage in highlighting borders on objects such as cars, walls and general objects while enemies are highlighted red making them easier to pinpoint. The graphics are Halo style all the way and if you thought that the graphics for Halo 3 were at least passable, you'll probably feel the same way with this one as well.There's also a great mode called Firefight which most likely will get compared to Gears of War 2's Horde mode where you survive wave after waves of increasingly stronger enemies. If you liked it then, you'll love it now as it's every bit of much fun as Horde was. In my opinion, this mode is worth owning the game for just on its own value.All I can say is, if you like Halo in the least, there's no way you can get disappointed by this. While the campaign is admittedly a bit short, clocking in somewhere between 7-10 hours depending on how much time you invest in achieving all the game has to offer, it still provides a decent challenge while playing in Legendary difficulty. Again, multiplayer co-op in either campaign or firefight mode is a blast. I loved every minute of this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"A great collection with some minor flaws","reviewText":"Having never bought either ICO or SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS for the PlayStation 2, but having heard glowing reviews for both, I figured that this HD collection would be a great introduction to the Team Ico series. I am coming to these games as a person who has never played either one, and have only within the past year or so become familiar with them. For a first-time player, this collection is a great title.ICOThis is a puzzle-platformer with a distinct sense of isolation and an artful atmosphere. From the opening sequence to the actual start of gameplay, I was intrigued, though not outright \"sold\" on the game. The story is simple: Ico is alone in a strange castle on an isolated island with only one other companion, a girl named Yorda. Neither of them speak the other's language, so they have to work together using gestures and simple intonation to make it through the castle's traps and puzzles. Only Ico can accomplish puzzles requiring strength and ingenuity, and you need Yorda to open doors and save the game.The gameplay is very straightforward, with a simple button scheme (of which, excluding the analog sticks, you'll use five of most of all) and very simple combat. The puzzles can be absolute head-scratchers, and some require a rest and restart the next day before they make sense. There are a few I had to go and look at a walkthrough for, in fact, although I managed to figure many of them out on my own. Great puzzles and simple controls make this a game that can be played by just about anyone.The music is minimalist, from a Zelda-like tune during the saving process to an ominous, simple rhythm for when enemies are around. The ambient sound effects include eagles and other forest-dwelling birds, crackling torches, rushing water, and rustling trees. The graphics have the slightly dated look of the PS2 era, but they shine in 720p nonetheless, with such touches as dynamic lighting and bloom effects. As I never played the original PS2 version, I can't comment on the graphical increase, but I can say that this game is a good way to test your television setup.The camera, unfortunately, is where ICO suffers the most: it sits at fixed locations which can only be minimally adjusted by the player and has led to a lot of cheap deaths for myself, some of which could have been negated by full camera control. There is a key difference between \"cinematic\" and \"practical\", and unfortunately ICO doesn't bother to mesh the two. Poor camera locations have also caused confusion with objects and textures, as it makes it very difficult to see around pillars and other objects. I did get used to it after a time, but the camera never stops being annoying in all the wrong places. A lack of save points and checkpoints led to even more cheap deaths, unfortunately, which at times forced me to replay large sections. As of right now, I have not finished the game, though I am about two-thirds of the way through it and know how it ends, which seems to me to be enough to review the game.Overall, ICO is a nice addition and was great for the first hour and a half, but after that, I stopped enjoying the game as much as it started to feel long. It is, though, worth playing - others will most likely have less difficulty with the game than I did. Also, this is the EUROPEAN/PAL version of the game remastered for NTSC-region PlayStation 3 consoles, so there are some changes in puzzles and camera angles, as well as some additional bonuses, from the original (going off of what the wiki and other people have said).SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUSThis is where Team Ico shines in this collection. Instead of being a purely puzzle-platformer, this an open-world adventure game with some puzzle and platforming elements. You play as Wander, a young man who comes to the Forbidden Lands through the only entry, a massive bridge spanning half the width of the Lands, to a shrine where he makes a pact with an ancient supernatural force to bring a girl, Mono, back to life. Like ICO, the story is minimalist, but unlike ICO, it grows into something bigger and more epic at the end. Your only companion is Agro, Wander's horse, whom you will use to cross the Lands with speed and agility, as well as defeat certain colossi and reach certain areas.The gameplay in SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS is a lot of fun and requires some imagination and creativity. The massive world and impressive draw distance, such as being able to see save points from miles away, makes it difficult not to get sidetracked. There are white-tailed lizards to hunt for increased stamina, fruits to shoot down from trees for increased health, hawks to hang onto and fish to ride, as well as nooks and crannies and incredible sights to take in. From a shadowy forest to a massive waterfall to an underground temple, the sights of the Forbidden Lands are absolutely incredible to behold. There's lots of things like moss and trees to climb, while fighting the colossi can be anywhere from relaxing to epic to frustrating.The music in the game is minimalist, reserved for fights against the colossi, their introductory sequences, their death sequences, and certain cutscenes. With a few exceptions, all the music is wonderful, with \"Silence\" and \"Revived Power\" being standout tracks. Sound effects include rushing water, rustling trees, hawks crying, and the sound of wind, the pitch of which changes depending on whether you're in a cavern or out in the open.The controls for the game are great, and once I got used to holding the R1 button to hang on to things, it turned out to be a very intuitive and unique control scheme with some shades of ICO in it. On Normal difficulty, it is very difficult to die, and thankfully there's a large number of save points to use all across the map.Overall, SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS is the best addition to the collection. The camera, graphics, sound, gameplay, and story all work together to create a unique, emotional, artful journey that asks a lot of questions, many of which can only be answered with your own convictions and beliefs. I am currently over halfway through my second playthrough and am going to start a playthrough in Hard mode - a good indicator of the quality of this game. I was a bit concerned that, as a Japanese game, it would embrace the occultic influences. Instead, it does the opposite, ending the story with the reason why the Forbidden Lands are forbidden in the first place almost explicitly stated. This is honestly one of the first and probably only games that has taken this stance on the supernatural, and I am very pleased with it.EXTRAS- The cover art can be reversed to have SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS's original artwork and ICO's original European artwork facing outward rather than the \"HD collection\" artwork.- The collection includes two dynamic XMB themes, one for ICO and one for SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS.- Also on the disc are five videos, mostly dealing with the two games already on the disc. While the cover says that there is a peek at THE LAST GUARDIAN included, I have yet to locate it.- ICO includes the European bonuses, such as two-player, an additional extended ending scene, and extra hidden weapons.THE ICO AND SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS COLLECTION is a wonderful addition to anyone's PS3 library, although ICO has its drawbacks that take the collection down from five stars to four in my opinion. It's worth picking up, but maybe not at the full price. If in doubt, rent it first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

The first portion is editorial; the second portion covers technical aspects and features.  Each section is broken up by CAPS to ensure for easier reading and ease of use; if you are looking for specific information, simply look for the CAPS headers]The eight generation of video game consoles is upon us, with the Nintendo releasing the first console of that era, the Wii U. Nintendo has a lot riding on the Wii U. While theWiihas been the most commercially successful console of its generation, the perception has been that the Wii is firmly for causal gamers, and the XBOX 360 and PlayStation 3 is for the hardcore gamers. Also, given the bumbled launch of the 3DS (Nintendo's most botched debut of new hardware, with the sole exception of Gunpei Yokoi's 1995 Virtual Boy), Nintendo has to get the Wii U right. Here are some concerns that Nintendo wants to address with the Wii U.THE WII IS ONLY FOR CASUAL GAMERS: One item that effectively fueled that (largely incorrect) perception is the packaging of \"Wii Sports\", which clearly demonstrated what the motion-controlled driven Wii was all about and what it was fully capable of accomplishing. Interestingly enough, the basic edition (covered in detail later in the review) does not include the Wii U's version of \"Wii Sports\", a game called \"Nintendo Land\". Most likely though hardcore gamers will want the Deluxe Edition due to the extra features included, including quadrupling storage space. It was only because of \"Wii Sports\" dethroned \"Super Mario Bros.\" that \"Super Mario Bros.\" finally had to relinquish its title as the best selling video game of all time. \"Wii Sports\" moved over eighty million units, and according to the Nintendo channel people played that game a LOT.BAD NETWORKING: Another notorious weakness of the Wii was its weak network infrastructure. Online gameplay is the order of the day, and Nintendo has been behind the eight ball for this generation due to poor implementation of online gaming. Although some Wii titles included online gaming (\"Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel\" and \"James Bond 007: GoldenEye\" come to mind), the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 offered much more robust gaming options in this milieu. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", one of the biggest titles of the Wii era, notoriously did not include this much needed functionality.LACK OF THIRD PARTY TITLES: One of the major selling points of any Nintendo console is the Nintendo IPs: we all know the only place you get Mario (\"New Super Mario Bros. U) and all his various sub-series, Link, Samus, Pikmin, Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Donkey Kong, Star Fox, Pokeman, Kid Icarus, Animal Crossing, Fire Emblem, The Legendary Starfly, etc, are on Nintendo hardware. As strong as these IPs are, to flourish Nintendo MUST have the support of third party developers. The Wii missed out on some of the biggest titles of the seventh generation, largely due to the radically different control scheme of the Wii compared to the other two consoles and the lack of HD support, as well as the required work to convert XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 titles to the Wii.The Wii U fixes the issues that were keeping away the third party games. Despite all the brouhaha regarding the GamePad, in one way Nintendo has become more conservative in their approach to third party developers. TheNintendo Wii U Pro Controller - Black(largely similar to the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 controllers) appear to be built directly for the third party developers to be able publish titles across multiple platforms with very little technical adjustments required to adjust for each console. Bringing the Wii U into closer technical proximity to its brethren means that developers won't have to have the added cost of having a production team set aside especially for the Nintendo console. The launch shows promise that third party developers are getting behind the Wii U, with exclusive titles of \"Bayonette 2\" and \"Rayman Legends\", as well as game series making their debut on a home Nintendo console (\"Assassin's Creed 3\",\"Darksiders II\", \"Mass Effect 3\") and also \"Call of Duty: Black Ops II\". And rather than limiting and potentaily discouraging multi-platform titles with their radically different controllers, it's quite possible the Wii U GamePad will really strengthen the Wii editions of their perspective titles, affording gameplay design options unavailable on the other consoles.And, just maybe, my dreams of playing a current generation \"Elder Scrolls\" game on a Nintendo Console is this much closer to a reality. Only time will tell how the eight generation works out and who comes out on top in the market. Even though Nintendo had the weakest system of the seventh generation, they came out on top despite some obvious deficiencies. While the Wii U can give you the impression Nintendo is trying to get out from behind the eight ball (to use the pool analogy a second time), but remember: the Wii dominated, and I have a feeling that the Wii U will dominate as well.TWO  IMPORTANT POINTS OF KNOWELDGE FOR NEW WII U OWNERS: Before we get into the technical aspects, there are two items of which you should be aware1.  SYSTEM UPDATE: You must run a required system update (available at launch) to use the Miiverse, Wii U Chat, eShop, in addition to backwards capability for playing Wii games on the Wii U.  To perform the system update, you must have an Internet connection, so if you purchase the Wii U and do not have an Internet Connection you will not have these functionalities.2.  AUTOMATIC SYSTEM SHUTDOWN: Please note that in the system configuration options, the Wii U is automatically set to shut down after a certain amount of time after no system input.  If you pause your game and come back an hour later, you may very well find the system has been shut down due to this option, losing any progress you have made; you will want to disable or recongiure this setting if idle time is a concern for you.3. TVii will not be available until sometime in December.That largely concludes the editorial section of the review. The following content will focus on the technical features of the Wii U, as well as the new features that the Wii U offers as opposed to the Wii.STANDARD EDITION (Suggested Retail: $299.99) vs. DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION (Suggest retail: $349.99)- Here is a break down of what is in the two different launch versions. The Standard is White and the Deluxe is Black. Also important to know: the Standard Set and the Deluxe Set DO NOT INCLUDE the necessary AV cables to hook up the Wii U to a standard definition TV. You will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. Also, PLEASE NOTE neither edition include Wii Remotes.STANDARD EDITION:-Wii U Console with 8GB of Internal Storage-Wii U Gampad-Sensor Bar-GamePad AC Adapter-Wii U AC Adapter-HDMI Cable.DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION:-Wii U Console with 32 GB of internal storage (four times as much as the 8GB of the Standard)-Sensor Bar-GamePad AC Adapter-Wii U AC Adapter-HDMI Cable-Wii U GamePad Cradle, GamePad Stand, and Console Stand (for those wanting their console to stand vertically like the Wii rather than lying flat horizontally)-The NintendoLand game.Looking at the list, the chief differences between the two editions is the 32GB of storage as opposed to the 8GB, the three individual stands (although the Wii U Console Stand is comprised of two different pieces) , and the inclusion of \"NintendoLand\".CONSOLE: Like its predecessor the Wii, the Wii U features a brand new and innovative controller scheme. The GamePad, the Wii's new controller, is attracting a good deal of attention, as the controller functions almost as a separate gaming device in conjunction with the Wii U. The new controller is the GamePad. Like the Wii before it, the Wii U is inextricably tied up in its controller and the potential of added functionality via the controller. The main driving design ideology behind the controller is pushing what Nintendo calls \"Asymmetrical Gaming\". In plain English, this means that by virtue of the Gamepad individual players can assume different roles in a gaming session. For example, in \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", players with the Wii Remote can focus on clearing the course, whereas the player with the GamePad can actually assist the other players by creating platforms and clearing obstacles from the other players' paths.CONTROLLER SPECIFICATIONS: At launch additional Gamepads will not be available. The Wii U will only support two Gamepads at once, and performance will suffer when running two GamePads at once. Here are the features of the Gamepad. The Wii U can support four Wii Remotes and one GamePad. At the time of launch it is unknown if it can support two GamePads and four Wii Remotes at once.-6.2 inch (15.7 cm) 16:9 resistive touchscreen-Functions as an Infared Universal TV remote controller, regardless if the Wii U is powered on.  Syncing the Gamepad as a Universal remote is very simple.-Gaming Functionality independent of the Wii U. Nintendo has described video game consoles as being \"parasites\" to TVs, and the Wii U resolves that issue with this innovative controller. If other people in the family or those you live with want to watch television, you can still play games using the Wii U GamePad, completely separate from the Wii U. The GamePad can also play videos as well.-Supports social media, such as Facebook and Twitter-Internet browsing on both the Gamepad and TV-Able to draw pictures and upload these pictures into the Miiverse-Users can replace controller batteries, unlike Apple products.  Battery life is 3-5 hours; after approximately 500 charges, battery will only retain about 70% of its charge.  The Wii U Pro controller also features swapable batteries.-Share content (such as video) to the TV-Stylus (like the Nintendo DS)-Includes camera, microphone, and a 3.5MM headphone jack along with volume control and stereo speakers. The GamePad supports video chat.-Built-in 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and a geomagnetic sensor-Near-Field Communication included, where you can get stand alone devices that the Gamepad will interact with if placed in close proximity to the Gamepad.-Two analogue thumbsticks that function as buttons when physically depressing them-Select, Start, Home and Power buttonsA/B/X/Y face buttons, L/R bumper buttons and ZL/ZR trigger buttons-Controller sync button-Motion control (this is a no brainer, given the legacy of the Wii), rumble vibrations (like the N64 Rumble Pack)-Rechargeable battery housed inside the device.-You can power on the Wii U from the Gamepad-IMPORTANT TO NOTE: the Wii U Gamepad is NOT backward compatible with Virtual Console/Wii Ware titles.  You can only play these titles on the TV via regular Wii controllers.PRO CONTROLLER: Nintendo is also releasing what is called a Wii U Pro Controller, which is largely identical to the Wii Classic Controller Pro.  The Pro Controller is sold seperately. The Pro Controller is wireless, also has an internal battery and clickable analogue sticks and buttons on the top of the device like the L and R button from the Super NES controller.  This controller will last up to 80 hrs on a single battery charge. Recharging to maximum capacity takes 4.5 hrs.HD GAMING: Another sore spot for Wii players has been Nintendo's lack of support for HD gaming. This has been fully addressed in the Wii U. One of the most famous pre-release pictures of what the Wii U can do graphically has been Link form \"The Legend of Zelda\" fighting a giant spider that resembles Gohma. The artwork is gorgeous and really shows what the Wii U can do artistically graphically.Please note you must have an HD TV that supports the resolution to maximize the full potential of the Wii U. Again PLEASE NOTE you will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself if you have a standard TV, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. The Wii U only comes with an HDMI cable. The Wii U supports the following video resolutions: 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p.BACKWARDS CAPABILITY: The Wii U supports all Wii peripherals/titles. However Wii titles will still be in their normal resolution of 480p, so no HD gaming for you on Wii titles, my friends. Likewise (and this isn't surprising, since later versions of the Wii removed this functionality as well), the Wii U will not support Gamecube titles. Nintendo has not confirmed whether they will release Gamecube titles as future digital releases at the time of launch.Also (and this is huge), you can transfer ALL of your Wii data to the Wii U (retail data, downloaded content, game history, etc), including Virtual Console and Wiiware titles. Nintendo has attracted the ire of the gaming community from its rather backward network setup for the Wii - rather than VC and Wiiware purchases being linked to online accounts like Apple's iTunes, the purchases are tied to the individual system and a lot of people (myself included) were worried about what would happen to all the titles we bought for the VC and Wiiware. It's quite easy to have a lot of money tied up in those types of purchases. Thankfully this problem has been resolved.  At the end of the review is the step-by-step process in transferring your data.NINTENDO NETWORK AND NETWORK ID ACCOUNTS: Finally, Nintendo is addressing its weak network infrastructure that so limited the Wii. The Wii U is thankfully account-based like iTunes, with one Wii U supporting up to twelve unique accounts. Like the 3DS and the Wii, the Wii U will include its own version of the eShop, will full length games available for download upon their release dates. Also if you purchase the Delux Set you will get a Nintendo Network Premium account. This is a two year subscription account and features discounts and exclusive content.Nintendo Network comprises the following: Nintendo eShop, Miiverse, Nintendo TVii, and Wii U Chat.  In order to use these different components, you will need to register your Nintendo Network ID.  This Nintendo Network ID will replace the previously cumbersome Friend Codes.  To register your Nintendo ID account, you will need to enter an ID, a password, your birthday, gender, location, and email address.In order to use the Wii U, you will have to set up an account.  The Wii U can support up to twelve individual accounts.  Once you set up your user accounts, you will select your own Mii each time you start up the Wii U.  Each account will manage the following: Game settings, Game Saves, Internet Bookmarks, and Playhistory  After selecting your account upon system startup, you will be taken to the Waruwaru Plaza, a giant gathering spot for Miis.Your purchases from the Nintendo eShop will be registered to your specific account; however, any account on your Wii U can play software from the eShop that is purchased under a specific account.  You will be able to use the Nintendo Network ID on non-Nintendo devices (such as PCs and Smartphones) in 2013 to access Nintendo services such as Miiverse and the eShopNINTENDO TVii - Available only in the US and Canada, TVii allows Wii U owners to watch TV content from multiple online sources, such as Netflix, Hulu, and even your DVR or Tivo, although most likely you will have to connect your DVR/Tivo to the Wii U as the Wii U doesn't have that functionality.MiiVERSE - Nintendo's vision of a social network, the Miiverse is essentially just that: a social network. The big question regarding the Miiverse is content moderation, which at the time of launch has not been fully explained by Nintendo. Like the Nintendo Channel for the Wii, the Miiverse collects data on what games are being played globally and will work as a key marketing tool in pushing the big games everyone is playing. Thanks to current technology, game companies can get data about what people are actually playing that back in the 1980s and 1990s they could only dream of.You can easily switch between gaming and the MiiVerse, asking for assistance, bragging, or making comments, and then seamlessly go back to the gameplay.  The Miiverse also has filters for spoilers; when posting to the Miiverse, the player can mark the post as a spoiler, and  you can configure your system to ingore these posts.  Also, if enough players vote a post as a spoiler, the system will mark the post as a spoiler.The Miiverse is built directly into the system, so all Wii U games are compatible.  Game developers can all use the Miiverse for added functionality; if a player fails multiple times in one specific spot, the game can display comments made by other players regarding that exact spot.INTERNET, MANUAL, AND ACHIEVEMENTS: Wii U will not feature Achievements or Trophies.  You can pause your game play, by pressing the home button and on the Gamepad open up the Web Browser, and then likewise return to gameplay.  Although there is some brief printed materials, the Wii U Manual is digitally stored and accessible within the system itself.PORTS AND OUTPUTS-4 USB 2.0 ports, two in front two in back-SD Memory Cart Port-AV Multi Out port supporting composite video, YPBPR component video, S-Video (NTSC consoles only), RGB SCART (European consoles only) and D-Terminal (Japan only)-HDMI 1.4 out port-Sensor Bar Port and Power PortPHYSICAL DIMENSIONS, MEMORY, PROCESSORS-approximately 1.8 inches tall, 6.8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long-CPU: IBM POWER7-based multi-core processor-GPU: Custom AMD Radeon High Definition GPU.-Total memory: 2GB.

{"product_name":"B0037LTTRO","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Anderson \"Robbin505\"","summary":"This game is worth the money!","reviewText":"I love this game.  The campaign is long and a very involved experience.  This is not your typical run and gun.  This requires using your team and the equipment in very tactical ways.  This game is great for so many reasons.  First off, the campaign is fully playable with up to four people.  Get your friends together and play the campaign.  When that is done there is the multiplayer experience which is really engaging.  You can easily get into matches with friends by simply joining them from the friends screen.  No more long complicated invite processes, you can simply jump in and out of lobbies as you want.  The game play is fun because it is team goal oriented, just killing people is not enough.  I love the different equipment that is available through the leveling system.  Each class has different choices of guns, grenades, and equipment through out the game.  Each gun can be specifically designed to your needs.  Layouts and classes can be easily switched at the re-spawn screen.  Third person game play is fun and you can still aim in first person if you want.  I know this game has received mixed reviews but I think it is more a question of personal choice over actual game play being the problem.  If you like run n' gun COD game play this might not be for you but if B3 and Tom Clancy stealth/strategy games appeal to you this may be a good way to spend some time with friends.  This is a great reintroduction of the series and I hope that any complaints about this game will be fixed in a sequel.Update 10-06-2012 With the constant addition of good DLC I would still rate this game a strong buy.  I know other shooters are debuting this fall but I think this game still has legs on it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2012"}

Wolverine, Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk to name a few but none of these can compare to the mercenary with a mouth. I am talking about the red and black fool that is known as Deadpool with his over the top antics and insane combat skills. Now Activision is making a game based on his exploits but is this one ride you will want to take or should you just sit this one out?The plot of the game is that you are hired to assassinate a corrupt media mogul by the name of Chance White. Mr. White has made such reprehensible shows such as Jump the Shark in which contestants have to jump over a pool of great white sharks. Without giving much away there are more Marvel characters in this game than I have seen in many others with appearances being made by Wolverine, Cable, Mr. Sinister and Psylocke to name a few.The game is a third person shooter which you will be able to use not only deadpool's iconic blades and guns but various other weapons that are scattered throughout the levels. These range from lasers , giant hammers and even weapons like sai can be found and used on various opponents. Deadpool also has a short range teleportation move which can be useful in getting up close and personal with the enemy. He also has a healing factor but if he's getting shot up too much you can scavenge for body parts and attach them to him or just wait for the body parts to regrow.While playing this game deadpool will shout out his usual one liners and quips such as \"You're going to want to have a doctor look at that\" to a dismembered corpse or \"roll for melee damage\" as you inflict pain with a giant hammer. This game also breaks the fourth wall as deadpool will look out at the player either to praise him or to berate him for \"dropping the camera\". There is plenty of humor in this game and it balances it out well with the action.If you are a fan of shoot `em up games or Deadpool in general you should give this game a look as it is filled with action, weapons and enough one liners to make you laugh hard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"K. Groh","summary":"Good Addition to the Trilogy","reviewText":"I've played the previous Professor Layton games and I have to say that I think they continue to get better. The second game,Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, was much better than the first game,Professor Layton and the Curious Village. This is not the same 'big difference' but is a bit better.The story line is interesting enough. The introduction to many puzzles is still pretty lame but I'm not sure how else they could segue from the story to the puzzle screen. The dialogue gets a little monotonous, as usual, but my son loves to read it all so that he can get the gist of the storyline. I like to fly through it to get to the puzzles.The extra games, a parrot trying to deliver a product, a toy car that has to follow a certain track that you design, are fun and can be a challenge.The puzzles seem to be a bit easier overall than in the Curious Village. Either that or I've finally learned many of the same tricks and tips to solve them. There are some new twists but many repeat concepts.There are added features in Memo mode which made using that section much easier. There are multiple pen colors, an eraser, and the ability to draw a thick or thin line.It took me, doing all the puzzles and extra games and a ton of repetitious walking around, about 13 hours to complete everything. I still have a couple of puzzles in Layton's bonuses though.Entertaining but not too long lasting. Once you are done, the idea of going back to do a once a week download game, is not that appealing.Overall, a fun game, good graphics but not a great one to pick up after you've solved it all. Really a 4 star rating.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"MDias","summary":"GREAT GAME","reviewText":"For its time it was great game in fact on of the best if ur looking for the best on the Xbox and want to be scared get this I recently brought a Xbox and this game to relive those old games put my ps3 to the side for a while and enjoying this one they don't make games like they used to if u have a Xbox get this game while u still can ..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Radaar\"","summary":"Great Game With An Innovative New Feature","reviewText":"This is the first survival-horror game that I've ever played.  I never really got into the genre, but this game always intrigued me.  I read about it when it first came out, and the game's new feature of the sanity meter sounded really cool.  One of my friends (who is now my roommate) has the game, so I finally tried it, and was blown away.Right from the beginning, things start off creepy, and they only get worse (which, for players, means better).  You start out as Alex Roivas, a young woman in her 20's whose grandfather was recently murdered.  The police are stumped, because there doesn't appear to be any sign of a break-in, nor does it look like Grandpa Edward Roivas put up much of a fight.  This would normally lead to a ruling of suicide, but the state in which they found the body makes suicide an impossibility.  Alex decides to investigate herself, and you navigate her grandfather's mansion.  Everything in it references the dark and macabre, from paintings of murderers to books in the library about some of the darkest periods in history (the Inquisition, the Salem witch burnings).  Eventually, Alex discovers a book called the Tome of Eternal Darkness.  When she reads it, she is transported to another time, place, and body.  Whenever players \"read\" a new chapter of the book, they take over as another character in another historical period.  A Roman centurion, a young Cambodian girl, a British photographer, and a few of the Roivas ancestors are just a few of the people that you'll control throughout the ages.As the story unfolds (which depends on a choice you make as the centurion), you learn about the Ancients, three god-like beings fighting for control of the world, and if one is summoned, will reign destruction upon the galaxy.Not only is the story engaging, the gameplay is great.  The weapons and magic system are great.  I love the fact that you can design your own spells before you are actually \"supposed\" to learn them.  This game has some really cool weapons, like the elephant gun, the broadsword, the double-barreled shotgun, and the fireman's axe, which is great for chopping off heads.  Due to a unique and great aiming system, you can aim at specific body parts, being able to chop off heads or arms.The other aspect of gameplay is the sanity meter.  Sanity is a running theme throughout the game.  As your sanity decreases, weird things start to happen, and not just to your character in the game.  Many of the effects are directed at the player, and even if you know what might happen (like me), many of them will still catch you off guard.  And while some effects do effect the characters (many of them foreshadow future events that will happen to them), they do rattle the cages of the players as well.  This game has an insanity effect that targets Alex, and it is the only thing in a video game that has EVER made me jump is shock and even horror.I guess the one thing that I would change is the whole \"choose your path\" thing at the beginning of the game.  You have three paths to choose from, but they are, for all intents and purposes, the same.  The only thing that changes between path to path is the Ancient that Pious summons, which does have a few effects.  The color of that ancient will play an important role througout the game, but besides that, the missions are all exactly the same.  In order to get the full ending, you have to play the game 3 times through (one with each Ancient), but it would be more of an incentive if each Ancient had a different path to play.  Oh well, it's a small grievance.Overall, this is one of the most interesting, creepy, and all-around fun games in a while.  It may be too intense for some people, but I urge you to give it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0010EF0UK","description":"","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"Pack it up, Parappa! There's the door, DDR! Say hello to Patapon!!!","reviewText":"When I picked up this game for rental at my local video store, I had no idea what to expect. After playing it, I can say this: Patapon is without a doubt, one of the most addictive and fun PSP games I have ever played.The game is simple enough - we are the unseen God of a little tribe of people who look like walking eyeballs called the Patapon. We start out with a small group of soldiers called Yaripon, and embark on a quest to defeat the evil Zigoton tribe, and find the elusive \"IT\".The soldier classes are the following:Yaripon - Spear throwing soldiersTatepon - Foot soldiersYumipon - ArchersKibapon - Soldiers on horsebackDekapon - OgresMegapon - Soldiers with musical hornsNow like any good Role Playing Game (RPG), you have to decide which soldiers are the best suited for each mission. Some are good at hunting, others are not. Some rush headlong into battle, others wait it out and release devastating attacks from afar.Here's the gameplay twist - for your platoon to perform any action, you have to tap out special drum beats on the PSP buttons.For example:Moving your platoon requires the beat \"pata-pata-pata-pon\"Ordering your platoon to attack requires the beat \"pon-pon-pata-pon\"If drum beats are played successfully a number of times in a row, you can unlock \"fever mode\" - this unlocks more powerful attacks and quicker troop movements. If you miss a beat, you have to start again. As you get more proficient at Patapon, you can unlock more advanced drum beats, create more powerful soldiers, unlock mini-games, find hidden artifacts, discover miracles, and more.During each mission you can gather currency (known as ka-ching!), various raw materials, and weaponry. These items can be used to create more powerful Patapon soldiers during the level breaks.There are a few negative items about Patapon:(1) There is no pause button. Once you start a stage, it can take up to 7 minutes to clear. Any interruptions and it's bye, bye, fever mode.(2) There is an item pickup error. Sometimes when Patapon finish their victory song, they will walk right over some items without adding them to the spoils of war.(3) It's not clear how to \"retire\" a solider and create a new one. You have to delete a solider in the preparation screen with the select button - I had to go online to figure this out.Patapon is a fun and very addictive little game. With over 30 levels and 4 mini-games, that's a lot of playability for a great price. This is the only PSP game I've come across that combines problem solving, strategizing, and bongo-beating into a hilarious little package.If you like rhythm games such asDance Dance RevolutionorPaRappa The Rapper, you will definitely find a lot of enjoyment playing Patapon.If rhythm games aren't your thing, or if the aforementioned issues would cause you frustration, you might want to skip this one.Don't worry, the best way to know if you're addicted to Patapon is if someone in your house comes down with a temperature and the first thought in your head is:\"Keep it up!!!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}

Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do.  I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies.  Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry.  Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market.  However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash.  This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell.  Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions.  Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave.  Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles.  However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock.  Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS.  Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry.  In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller.  Unfortunately, the quality was very low.  This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET.  Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves.  ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble.  Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue.  Atari lost the suits.  Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products.  (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.)  The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete.  Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984.  With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984.  In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily).  Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore.  The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it.  Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well.  What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company.  It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets.  (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.'  Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line.  In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer).  It was a massive hit in Japan.  In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market.  Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through.  In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.  They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit.  In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title.  The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world.  With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time.  SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire.  It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept.  Also, it's one of the best.  Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment.  With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.  With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2004"}

Supports 1080P, but looks gorgeous even on 720P using Component Cable with a 2 year old Dell 24\" WS LCD that is not HDCP compliant. Audio is also very good. Gameplay is majority hack n' slash with very minor RPG'ish elements like most modern games, but still very enjoyable. Fetch a needed item and gain access to new areas, collect money to buy a handful of useful items, level up weapons, and gaining additional HP and ninja magic/MP is well incorporated into the game.Rachel looks gorgeous, a little too jiggly exxxaggerated. Rachel's level are short, but also well incorporated into the game. I didn't care much for it, but still didn't mind it either. While Ryu controls well and is very responsive, Rachel is much slower and her attacks are easily dodgeable by quick foes. She seems to take more damage also compared to Ryu, but her life bar is based on Ryu's. If Ryu has used HP items that add more life bar then Rachel benefits from this as well. Her roped grapple sub-weapon is useless compared to Ryu's selection. Ryu also looks awesome along with the game's environment.I never played the orginal XBox versions, but being a owner of several other consoles and handheld I was not deprived of similar games. To me this game is not the best hack n' slash adventure game ever, but a darn good and entertaining one still though. The game did not look as smooth as I was hoping for, especially for a game that is a few years old and started life on a weaker console. Anti-Aliasing seems to be only 2x, and their is noticeable lag randomingly even when not a lot is happening on screen. I'm not sure about the 60 FPS standard promised by Team Ninja or Tecmo, but the game does not always run at that frame rate. Game camera is also not very good at auto lock as the play moves around so much. Camera can be the cause of death a lot of times. Several bugs, but on rare occasions only. Load times can be terrible between gameplay and cutscenes (CS). On a few occasion the screen turns white and takes over 10 seconds to load a low resolution pixelated CG or in game graphic CS. The game locks up randomly and I never know when it locks up due to differing load times. I wait for a couple minutes and if nothing loads I reset the game, but again a rare occasion. On my PS3 this only happens with NG3S, which should have been more polished prior to release. Not a great XBox port to the PS3. $60 + tax for a decent port that didn't include all the original content from the previous XBox versions on a Blu-Ray disc and all new content is weak on the dollar value scale. I was disappointed when I read about the unlockable contents from the original XBox versions like the original NES playable series and a movie mode (CG & cutscenes viewable probably).I also thought I would be able to start with the equipments I had once I completed a difficulty like Devil May Cry series, but not the case here. Start a fresh game on a different difficulty setting with nothing, but experience from the previous play through. Fighting techniques and moves are unlockable so your favorite slash attack is locked again once you restart another adventure. Rachel's wigs are locked away again, which the hard work to unlock in the first place was not worth it. Her adventure is short and unlocking accessories and hairstyle/wig is not really necessary nor worth it a second time around. I'm currently playing through Hard mode and I actually struggle less compared to my first time through on Normal mode, but still a tough game. I would consider this a rental if you are a decent casual gamer and just want to complete this game. The length time for this game is moderate, but once through the replay is very low on the value scale. I mean unlocking new customes doesn't make the game any more different or enjoyable and not having the ability to swap between customes at will once a new game is started is even lamer. Even PSOne games like Resident Evil allows custome swapping during game. With very little to no interaction with NPCs and going from fight scene to the next becomes repetitive like most games in this genre. Overall, buy this game if you enjoy challenges and hack n' slash'em adventures. Otherwise, rent it and be entertained a one time through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2007"}

I have been gaming since Nintendo 8 bit, and had everything from sega to jaguar to xbox and all manner of gaming platform in between. Its incredible to see what it has evolved into. In my opinion, anyone trashing this system is an Xbox employee, or was unlucky and got a defective product.The ps4 operates more like a computer, it hasnt frozen, instead it crashes to desktop and sends an error report when there is a problem, a tremendous improvement from the ps3 freeze.I havent tried any video, music, etc service....don't care about that, I use it for games......I Have a pc that I can use for everything elseGraphics are insane, operates smoothly, looks fantastic. This thing purrs. Its a ferrari.UI is ok, kinda bland, but who cares really, i dont play the UINew controller is great, a true improvementLights on the system/controller are ok, not as distracting as i thought it would be in a dark room.Ps4 is worth the hype, it lived up to it.If you are an Xbox fan you should be excited, next gen is sick, and if the xbox is anything like the ps4 you will love it. And if it isnt, dont worry, jump ship to the ps4 and enjoy. It's a gaming powerhouse.As far as bugs go, who can say....on launch day it took a bit to get online and play, but wasnt too much of a wait. I was upset at first and worried that it was going to be defective, or a brick. However, once I got online and played, oh baby, my fears went away and I am thoroughly impressed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"Lackluster, but not without potential","reviewText":"I agree with the other reviews citing this as being something of a letdown at first glance.Edit for graphical update:I originally found the graphics on this game to be lackluster.  My system couldn't run it in remotely full detail and still be playable, so my game didn't look anything like the screenshots.  So I did what any good gamer would do: bought a new system.  Incredibly, even on a brand new fully speced out Alienware system with AMD 4000+ 64-bit processor, 2 gigs of RAM, and dual video cards (SLI, PCI Express) I *still* couldn't run the game in high resolution, high detail.  It looks pretty but it chops when I try to scroll the screen.  I think something is just plain broken with this game.  Other games run awesome on the new system, but not this game.Conclusion: you will never, ever play this game with it looking as good as it does on the screenshots.  Yes, those are some mighty pretty trees but it's not going to be as pretty when you adjust down to Medium or Low quality textures because no reasonable computer system can have smooth gameplay with high resolution and high texture detail.By comparison, LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth was quite attractive, even on my older computer.  They aimed a bit lower but spent more time making lower settings look attractive and it paid off better in the end.  I think the AOE3 team spent too much time perfecting high detail settings that most people can't use and not enough time on low/medium detail that most people will be forced to use.Anyway, gameplay-wise, one bit of good news is the \"home city\" concept where you build your \"decks\".  I'll disagree with another reviewer who suggested that AOE3 was designed for \"spread sheet gamers\" -- gamers who figure out how to win by calculating times and values on a spread sheet ahead of time rather than making tactical decisions on the fly.Spread sheet gaming worked in AOE2 because you knew who and what you were facing.  If you were the Spanish fighting the Goths, you knew exactly what you were up against.  You knew every civilization advantage and weakness and could plan your strategy ahead of time accordingly.In AOE3, this \"deck building\" concept amounts to a customization feature.  When you see I'm the British, you still won't know exactly what to expect.  Did I build my deck for lots of early, free troops?  Did I build my deck for an early economy?  How much effect did I add to my navy?  You can't plan your spreadsheet if you don't have all the data, and you'll never know exactly what your enemy has in his deck.I can also have multiple decks and I don't have to decide which I want to use until my first trip to the home city.  Thus if I decide to wait, I can see your rush coming and pick my \"counter rush\" deck.So in conclusion, while the gameplay itself is pretty much old-hat, very familiar from AOE2, I have hopes that this deck building system will give the game more longevity.  The consistant winners won't be the spreadsheet readers, it will be the people who can quickly adjust their tactics on the fly based on what unpredictible thing the enemy is doing, as a result of this deck building system.Hopefully, anyway.  It's going to take a good bit of online gaming to find out how that really pans out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2005"}

Each is good at specific tasks. Here is a fully unbiased review of how the PS3 performs as a next generation console unit.To start with, the PS3, like the XBox 360, supports full high definition. The Wii only supports a lower resolution. Since the Wii has a much lower price tag, that is a fair trade-off for people with a tighter budget. Gamers for whom a very high level of graphic detail is important will have to pony up for that ability.Along the same lines, the XBox 360 supports the HD format of high definition DVDs for movies, while the PS3 supports the Blu-ray format. If you haven't been following the whole format war for high definition DVDs, I have several articles on the topic on my gaming site. In short it's like the VHS/Beta wars when the VCR first came out. Is one better than the other? Will one format win out as the sole survivor? There's no way to tell. People will argue vehemently that one is better than the other. From a gaming point of view, the PS3 has the Blu-ray BUILT IN meaning every game can have 50 GIGS worth of game information. Think MASSIVELY huge maps, types of characters, etc. The XBox 360 only uses \"regular\" DVDs as its base game holder, which is 7 GIG. That is much smaller. You can buy an add-on HD DVD unit for about $100 but the storage is still smaller than Blu-ray - about 30 gig.People will argue about graphics until they're blue :) A lot of this comes down to how a specific game company *uses* the ability of the system. Looking at graphics on a tetris-like game will be much different than viewing the graphics of Oblivion or Gears of War. I found 360 graphics amazing on Oblivion. I equally found the PS3 graphics quite impressive on Genji's cut scenes (no enemy crabs in sight). Since both are high definition, I think that both have the same potential in real life terms. Both really shine in terms of fluid motion, precise detail and realism. I've seen it on both systems, on certain games. I've also seen junky graphics on both systems. Both are much better than the Wii.How about sound? All of these can plug into your stereo system. My boyfriend and I are both musicians. We have decibel meters and other sound-sensing tools. All three systems can create amazingly complex sounds, music, and in general a \"gaming environment\". Again I think it comes down to specific game makers, how they choose to use or not use that ability. It also comes down to how much you the gamer spent on your stereo system :)Speaking of sound, I do have to comment that our 360 is quite loud when it runs, despite our many attempts to help it be quieter. The PS3 right out of the box is MUCH quieter. Score 1 point for the PS3.On the general operating system for the units, all three consoles are going for more of a \"general use entertainment system\" presentation. The XBox has customizeable tabs that let you download new games, manage your environment and so on. The Wii also has channels that let you organize your gaming world. The PS3 has an interface almost exactly like that of the PSP, complete with cool drifting smoke waves in the background. You choose which area you want to work on - game, music, internet connection etc., and drop down to alter whatever feature you're interested in.So on to the on-line aspect, which most gamers are now fully interested in. Where the XBox 360 makes you buy an external connector for wireless, the PS3 has that built-in on the 60 gig model. The 20 gig model still requires an external connector (these run about $100). All will let you plug in a cable if you're still running a wired household.As a side comment on that, the XBox 360 has a 20 gig hard drive. However, they take up about 12 gig of that with their base system. So really you get 8 gig \"free\" for other things. Now, 8 gig might sound like a lot. But I still remember when the PS2 first came out and everyone was raving about the 8mb memory cards, how you could never possibly fill one of those up. We now have 8 memory cards and all are pretty much full. I have no doubt that 8 gig or even 20 gig is going to fill quickly. With the PS3 you at least do have that option for the 60 gig and it is really worth it. With the 360 your only option is to get an add-on drive to in essence back up the content you're not currently using and free up the main drive.How does the online world work on the PS3? The XBox definitely has the advantage here. Until this generation, *only* the XBox had a thriving community in their live world. The XBox 360 connected right into that XBox Live world, and they boast a *huge* community of gamers who actively gain points, play online and form virtual worlds. The PS3 and Wii both have to play catch-up at this point. Even if they have better interfaces, it's a matter of converting over all those players who have clans, familiarity and high point collections on the XBox world. Imagine if a new MMORPG came out right now that had fantastic graphics. Sure it might be wonderful - but will you really get all 800 trillion WOW players to drop their world and characters and friends to convert, especially if it costs more? It'll be a hard, slow sell.My summary? I definitely think all three have great games and that all three are worth owning. Of course I'm in a position that I *can* afford all three, which many people are not in. For example, I *love* the Zelda series, and I *love* the Final Fantasy series. I would be hard put to tell a person \"you need to get Zelda instead of Final Fantasy\". I would want the person to have both, because both are great for different reasons. If you really truly can only save up for one of the three consoles this holiday season, it isn't going to come down to which console is \"best\" for all players in some sort of a global way. It is going to come down to which console is best for YOU based on your specific gaming style.If you're on a really tight budget and just want something better than the previous generation, go for a Wii. It's cheap, the graphics are better, and the remotes are great fun. It has Zelda :) If you have a larger budget and really want the high definition, you're now choosing between the 360 and the PS3. You really do have to look at the specifics of each, and think seriously about your gaming style, to see which matches you best. If I were to make a flip summarization, if you really love online gameplay, I'd go with the XBox 360. Its years of head-start really give it a robust environment here. If you are looking for more of a home-based media center for your MPs3, photos and huge world gameplay, I'd go with the PS3. It definitely has the advantage on large scale games.Feel free to email me if you have more specific questions, or for screenshots, graphic descriptions, or interface information on any of the three systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

It's supposedly the between period of Jak and Daxter and Jak 2 but I just can't see the connection at all. You only see Jak at the very end of the game when you beat it and the storyline is short. The \"ecos\" are rarely mentioned in the game or have no significance.Some problems with the game include the occasional lag and small bits of glitches/bugs. When you walk outside of a building, there's the lag for obvious reasons. The glitches/bugs are everywhere; they're mainly on jumping, walls, and that sonic blaster (the third gun). During one of my games, there happened to be a glitch on the level before the final boss where I couldn't jump or move as fast/far as a should. Cutscenes would appear very, very shakey at times.The bugs are annoying, but I got used to it very quickly.The story [for me] was incredibly short. Maybe I was hoping for more because I've finished Jak and Daxter on the Playstation 2 and this was my first PSP game. I completed the whole game in a matter of 5-7 hours over a period of just under a week? Now that's short.There are quite a few levels on the game which is a major plus, but only 3 bosses. There's a lack of instructions many times in the game especially on the boss levels. Great that they had infinite lives because the constant dying was frustrating.Now for the positives:- It's actually really fun. There's plenty of killing and adventuring to do.- Minigames! Almost all in the same style but minigames nonetheless (parodies of famous movies)!- Brings back some older and newer gamestyles. There's driving levels and styles from previous games (see point above).- Secrets/Cheats (Just masks and behind the scenes).Despite all the negatives, the game isn't too bad. Having been released in 2006, it was part of the earlier generation of PSP so other games had an edge if they were released 2008-present.

Halo Wars was a great idea that was released on the wrong platform. Were this a PC title, a lot of great stuff could have been accomplished given that this is more or less an RTS game. The RTS genre grew from PC's and is awkward at best would implemented into console games.This is not to say that Halo Wars is a bad game. The storyline provides entertaining lore to the series and you get to take a break from FPS Halo, which is refreshing. Ensemble did a great job of making the controls as user friendly and intuitive as possible.

Shafer","summary":"Just Hype","reviewText":"When i first heard of Halo Wars, 2 things came to mind:1.  It was going to suck because ALL console RTS games suck when on consoles2.  It might be good simply because it was HaloAfter playing the game, it fell somewhere in between the 2.  The controls were fine but almost every match (campaign, skirmish and XBL) consisted of one of the following:1.  Rushing2.  Mass spam your super unit or rushI was really hoping to play an acctual strategy game on the console but this game was basically all hype.  The campaign was mediocre at best for having a non-existant boring story, nearly uniteresting characters, and unoriginal missions with the exception of maybe 2.  Skirmish wasnt that great because the AI on easier difficulties sat around and did nothing but on harder ones the AI would be brutal.  One match I started a game against a heroic AI and within the first 3 minutes they already had 3 bases nearly fully upgraded and were at tech 2 which is pretty much impossible to do.  Multiplayer matches come down to whoever can crank out super units of rush the fastest.If you were planning on getting this game, its a rent at best because its hard to say to buy the game because ive played better RTS games, much better.  I would reccomend Comand and Conquer: The First Decade instead because you get around 6 amazing games, including all of their expansion packs, all for the price of one.  In the end, Halo Wars confirms what we already know, RTS games dont belong on a console.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00149ILDO","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Excellent $20 gaming experience!","reviewText":"When the Saboteur was first released I was a bit skeptical about picking it up. The graphics looked great but the whole sand-box driving/shooting/climbing idea was looking a bit underwhelming (especially considering the better looking releases that were a full priced $60 like Assassin's Creed 2 and Infamous). However, now that Saboteur has dropped down to the $20 I've picked up and played a copy and can say it's well worth the money!The story (as you probably know)is a fun little espionage/revenge story where you play Irish racer turned freedom fighter Sean Devlin as he battles Nazi's in France during the occupation of World War 2. The story plays out very sylishly and while it's not the most memorable in gaming history it is very gripping and entertaining. The characters in the story are all over-the-top (even Sean himself) but are fun to watch and listen too and they add to the pulp-ishness of the plot.The gameplay is a fun mishmash of driving/climbing/open-world mayhem with a bit of stealth thrown in. The driving is VERY sluggish (I hate using the R2 bumper to accelerate in ANY game), the climbing feels awkward (you have to press jump each time you go to a different ledge), and the stealth is laughable (though disguises are a nice touch). Thankfully shooting and blowing things up is so much fun I can overlook just about everything else in the game!The graphics in this game are very good with great detail put into characters faces even during in-game conversations. The use of black-and-white is also a nice touch giving the game a noir-ish quality which it looses somewhat when you complete a mission and the area gets colorful again.The sound in this game is also very well done. There's always period music and ambient sounds which draw you into the WWII game world. The voice acting is quite good as well with Robin Atkin Downes particularly memorable as the foul-mouthed Sean (I know alot of people criticised his accent but coming from a working-class Irish family I can say the only thing unconvincing about his voice is the fact you can actually understand what he's saying!).The Saboteur does lack the polish of a lot of current games and definitely made me overlook it at it's original $60 price tag. Now that it's down to $20 it's easily worth your money and a must for open-world destruction fanatics!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2010"}

But, the story in this game is pathetic.  There basically is no story.  Don't worry about having to deal with an annoying last boss fight like in killzone 2.  The graphics in this game are extraordinary.  The voice acting is terrible, and so is the mouth animations of the player when they are supposedly screaming at eachother.  There is a little too much vehicle type gameplay for me in this game but i can deal with it.  When you get downed and can be revived by Rico it is extremely annoying because he never seems to be able to help.  Overall this game is definitely worth playing, and killing helghast is still fun.

One false step could get you thrown out of the hotel and forever seal the mystery of what happened on that dark Christmas eve so many years ago.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"Unique, entertaining, and challenging","reviewText":"Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is a unique game for the Nintendo DS that presents itself as an interactive graphic novel. Cast as disgraced police officer Kyle Hyde, you find yourself in a hotel with a shady past and where every visitor has a secret. One by one you'll unravel the secrets of those around you, all the while getting closer to Kyle Hyde's own demons.In terms of presentation and gameplay, Hotel Dusk is near perfect. The graphics are simple but effective, using a constantly moving pencil-sketch style of art that sets the tone for the characters and the story. You'll use the DS in a number of different ways, tilting it, using the touch screen, and even opening and closing it at parts in order to solve the game's many puzzles. The story is very linear, but provides enough problem-solving to make you feel as though you're the one advancing the plot. The writing and plot development are top-notch, making the game immensely entertaining even if viewed as more of a novel than a game.The one knock against Hotel Dusk is that the game provides little in the way of clues for some of the puzzles you'll need to solve in order to advance the story. This is not as big a problem as it would have been in the years before walkthroughs became easily available online, but it can get frustrating if you want to do things without any help. There will be times in the game where you'll just get stuck not because you aren't smart enough to finish, but because the game itself provides no clues on a crucial puzzle. Fortunately, there are only a few such pitfalls during gameplay. Overall, Hotel Dusk: Room 215 provides a terrific puzzle-solving experience and a film noir story that is entertaining on almost every level.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2009"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"a must-buy for MK fans new and old","reviewText":"Briefly, my MK past consists of the original game, which I liked, MK2, which I loved, then I was disappointed in MK3 because it got very cartoonish.  I pretty much abandoned the franchise after that...until now.The graphics in this game are excellent, as is the sound.  I haven't seen a single bug or glitch of any kind.  In terms of depth, combat here is much closer to Soul Calibur than the old MK games where you mostly spammed special moves and attempted jump-kick based combos.  Each character has their own combos with certain button sequences, just like their special moves.  Button mashers will not last long in this game.Characters have been individually developed as opposed to being little more than palette swaps like the ninjas of the old series.  Many of the special attacks make me cringe with their brutality, and the new X-ray meter is very well implemented.  It is gradually filled by landing combos, using special attacks and when you take damage.  Being rewarded for taking damage sounded dubious at first, but it turns out to merely balance out a lopsided fight rather than giving a cheap NBA Jam style comeback opportunity.  The X-ray bar has three sections.  As it fills, you can use one section for a boosted special attack, two sections for a combo breaker, or all three for the devastating X-ray attack, which looks incredibly cool and is unique for each fighter.  Better still, it can be blocked or avoided, so there's strategy in deciding whether to use it and risk draining your meter with nothing to show for it.  Then there are the fatalities, some of which have left my mouth agape with their sheer gore, and that's coming from someone desensitized by years of slasher films.  No more blowing someone up and seeing six gray legs fall to the ground.  The kills are very detailed and many include numerous gratuitous acts after the initial blow would clearly be fatal.There is a challenge tower which awards \"kombat points\" for completing tasks like landing so many strikes in a time limit, avoiding taking damage for 15 seconds, or landing specific attacks from a checklist in the corner of the screen.  These kombat points unlock extra fatalities (you only get one per character at first) as well as kombat codes to do things like disable throws or have quick uppercut recovery, as well as unlocking various artwork.  There are hundreds of unlockables and you don't know which you'll get, so it should make for hours of play to see everything.  There's also a story mode which is quite long and fun because it establishes the characters and their motivations.  There's also a tag team mode which lets you switch between characters during a fight.  There are even tag team moves in which your partner momentarily comes onto the screen for a specific attack that can be worked into your combos.This game has a level of depth, polish and imagination beyond anything I had hoped for.  It's the sort of thing where once you buy it, you better have a LOT of free time.  Anyone who was hesitant because it might be a disappointing game, or have bugs at launch as so many titles now do, fear not.  This is a finished product and is so high in quality that Midway should be embarrassed they didn't produce it when they had the chance.  Netherrealm Studios has taken the ball and run with it.  Non-gamers will of course use it to bash gamers and say they just enjoy mindless violence, but that's exactly what it is not.  In fact story mode doesn't even allow fatalities (they need the characters to stick around a while) and I hardly miss them thanks to the depth of the gameplay.  With the old MK games, fatalities were the reward for putting up with shallow play.  Now the fatalities are more of a footnote, with emphasis on exploring the deep combo system.  This game is worth paying full price for, so buy it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2011"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"I just really don't get it...","reviewText":"I just don't understand why \"Gears\" is so insanely popular.There are two types of games out there - games that make you say \"Hmm, what should I do next?\" and games that resort to \"Okay, what am I supposed to do now?\"Gears of War most certainly falls into the second category.  Gears is incredibly scripted.  Enemies pop out of the same places, at the same times, in the same configuration.  If you die, simply reload your last checkpoint with increased confidence because now you know exactly what will happen.I've read from various sources about the \"excellent graphics.\"  I'm not feeling it.  Every level is pretty much one color - gray, red or brown.  Everything looks the same.  Enemies dissapear at any distance because they blend in with their surroundings.  Maybe the detail is decent, but the game shows a lack of creativity and diversity.  Plus, the blood graphics rank up there with the original Mortal Kombat - they are extremely cartoonish and unrealistic.  It fits though, I guess, with the cartoonish and silly appearance of everything else in the game.  Vehicles are bulky and silly looking, even the humans are fat, bulky, and just odd-looking.The control schematics are effective if not cumbersome.  Yes you can lock yourself up against objects or walls for cover.  But there is a noticeable lag between a button press and the action taking place.  On many occasions I'd get to a concrete divider wall just as gun fire erupted from in front of me, then press the A button (cover) and watch my character do a forward roll against the wall, only to remain standing and get shot to hell while I frantically hit A again to take cover.  The A button makes you take cover, roll in any direction, AND run.  Maybe if they had used different buttons there could be better reaction times.  Also, there is no ability to crouch, meaning that you're always an obvious target unless you take cover.The game does have it's good moments.  I chuckled everytime I heard a Locust character mutter the word \"Grrrrriiiiinnd\" from a distance.  The audio is decent and the music helps add audible clues to the gameplay.  The Longshot Sniper Rifle gives ample opportunities to remove the head from an enemy - always a satisfying one-hit kill.  The story line really isn't bad, though I only played Gears 1 for about 10 minutes, so I definitely felt like I was walking into the middle of the story.  This game won't catch you up on what you missed.  It certainly left the possibility open for a third game, which I'm sure many will rejoice in.I was glad to see fewer multiplayer achievements than I had expected.  I was able to rack up 450 points just in single player, with the possibility of at least 200 more without ever going online.  Plus the option exists for local multiplayer gaming, an option that most newer games are sadly leaving out.I just don't understand why Gears is so popular.  The characters are extremely slow, the action is decent but remains stale due to the fact that you can hide in cover forever, and the graphics are uninspiring.  I beat the single player portion of the game in two days, and earned all the extra single-player achievements in one afternoon, making this game certainly unworthy of a $60 price tag - thus the 3-star rating.  Oh sure it was fun for those 10 hours or so, but with so many massive games available like Mass Effect, Fallout 3, and even Far Cry 2, why would you want to waste your time with another scripted shooting game?  It just doesn't make sense. I rented it and certainly feel like I got my $8 worth.I'm sure I'll be flamed away for this review - getting \"non-helpful\" votes simply 'cause some pimple-faced teenager doesn't agree with me.  Of course, they already own the game, so they shouldn't be voting anyways.  Then again, these kids are destined to be fast-food employees for the rest of their lives, so I should probably be more understanding.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002BSA3EM","reviewerName":"Noname","summary":"Great motivator for couch potatoes","reviewText":"Okay, by now, everyone and her mother owns this game. It is great for getting in shape. I love how it keeps track of my weight the how it graphs my progress. I like the little test it gives us before each session, though results on those tests seem to vary widely from day to day. (My Wii Fit age can be anywhere from 30 to 40.)There are four areas we can work on: yoga, strength training, cardio and balance games. Though the cardio is included, I feel the focus of this product is in strengthening the core muscles. For someone like me, who is neither athletic nor in shape, these exercises are not easy. My neighbor's co-worker actually injured herself so badly doing the Wii Fit, that she ended up in the hospital! So, a message for the unfit: go slow.The difficulty levels in Wii Fit increase gradually. The more Wii exercises I do, the more exercises are unlocked and I then have the choice of doing longer sessions.YOGAHolding those poses is not easy. Keeping the dot in the perfect spot is even harder. One of the problems with holding the dot still is that I am not always be able to see the dot from whatever position I have myself twisted into.STRENGTH TRAININGI found my heart beating hard after doing some of these, harder than it beat after cardio, so it can be an intense workout. Be prepared to be sore!CARDIOJogging can get a little boring. I can't run faster than my little guide.I'd get a littte frustrated with step sometimes, because I'd step, but the step wouldn't register. It's more about stepping with the beat in that game. They do let us step while watching tv, which I like; but it's not a hard workout.The hula hooping is fun, at first. As I hula hoop, the friends throw hula hoops at me to catch, but after awhile, they stop throwing hula hoops at me for me to catch and I just have to hula hoop. I get bored just hula hooping without anything else to do.Boxing can be fun, but I found out quickly that the jabbing motion doesn't register well. I have to \"hit like a girl\" for it to work. It would be fun if it was a true boxing game rather than the choreographed boxing game, but maybe that would turn off some women.BALANCE GAMESI have never been athletic, so balance is not easy for me. I have a very hard time with balance games, but balance games are the most enjoyable part of Wii Fit.SUMMARYWii Fit is a great way to motivate the couch potatoes like me. My core muscles need work and this is a great help. I recommend Wii Fit for anyone like me.For those who need cardio, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. It's not very good at focusing on that, the workout is not great (I'm not breathing very hard, and that's a bad sign because I'm very out of shape) and you might easily get bored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2009"}

You can get through it in maybe 8-10 hours.  But what an awesome 8-10 hours.  I would have been cranky if I paid fifty bucks for an 8 hour campaign to be honest, but as I paid less than half, I cannot complain.  I could imagine playing through the game over and over as a fill in between major game release cycles.It'd be great of the studio and publisher went ahead and enhanced the single player campaign with more installments.

In the end, the thieving features in Skyrim or Oblivion, were more rewarding - and that is pretty much all I wanted this game to surpass: a minor feature in another game. Is it fair to compare this game to Skyrim? Heck yes! At least to the way the stealing in that game played.In the end, for whatever my opinion is worth to your decision to buy, the stages felt very planned - you knew where you were supposed to be, or do to complete what ever goal they wanted. The stealth, done in a firs person, is pretty painful. In crouching mode, you can't even see over tables and in drawers. It feels like a shooter shoved into a stealth game. I wasn't a fan of Dishonored, and it feels like this game offers even less than that game offered. I could have looked past the open world, to this mess of levels and incoherent story plots (for me, at least), if there was -something- special about this game. The graphics are just OK (perhaps Last Of Us raised the bar on the prev. gen too high, and maybe that's an unreasonable expectation), however, there is nothing special about this game. I have zero desire to play it. If I were to ignore all the tedious &#34;open drawer, grab single item, close drawer, open other drawer, rinse and repeat until the room is cleared and you made minor change&#34;, then, well, why am I even bothering with this game.Three stars... average... nothing special... if this is your thing...

{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"The weakest game in the series in every way.","reviewText":"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others.Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title.1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission.2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character.3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying \"loco\" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone.4- The story compared to the others sucks. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this \"Everything is going to be destroyed\". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like \"were here to save lives\", \"were doing this to save lives\", \"this weapon will save lives\", \"we need to stick together to save lives\", \"billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them\", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives.5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say \"saving lives\".6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say \"This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending\". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still sucks and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.ME3 wasnt a horrible game but it was definitely not anywhere near as good as the other games in the series and was severly substandard for a bioware game. But then again ever since they joined EA their quality overall has declined quite a bit.All in all if you played the other 2 games then you'll obviously want to play this, but I wouldn't bother with it until it hits 20 bucks.And stay away from the collector's edition, I was stupid enough to buy it and I felt like I wasted my money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2012"}

Well, I was walking around at blockbuster, and that exact same phenomenon happend to me. I took it home, popped it in, and began the first mission. I was at parts amazed, at parts extremely disapointed while playing \"007: Agent Under Fire.\" (by EA Games).1. Gameplay: Okay...but not very good in a lot of parts. First, it just feels too easy. You go around shooting people who don't usually shoot back. The game is based on AUTO-AIM, which really kills gameplay.  The people don't look half as good as they should, and the missions overall are short and easy. There isn't much of a variety of guns. There is hardly any ammo, and for that case, what you come with isn't very much. The guns aren't very creative either. Just a handgun, maybe a rifle here or there.Vehicles: You normally control just one or two every 5 levels. One time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry, but it's gets old after awhile. The ability though, when you have an assistant in the car, to shoot from the headroof was extremely COOL. That was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns. Vehicles are here, they're just not that common.Story: Pretty good; it actually has one at least. You must save a hostage, escape the terrorists, take out people in stealth, break into the room, etc... It actually went by a story line, but the crappy part was Jame's girlfriend gets...2. Graphics: Decent, but not good. People's hands don't have 5 fingers, the backgrounds and guards and such don't have faces. Bullet marks disapear after going into the wall. No weather factors, collapsing buildings, etc... The graphics here were, once again, good, NOT GREAT!3. Sound: Probably the best part of the game. The voice acting (while people's mouths don't move when they talk) is excellent. The sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after re-loading brings the gameplay alive! The cars squel when they start fast, explosions rock the screen. Overall, it's pretty good. The music in the background is...BOND, of course. The sound was the best part of the game in my opinion, that and:Multiplayer: Very fun! The levels are fairly large, and the variety of weapons is huge! From jump packs, canons, bazukas, shot guns, snipers, handguns, etc...there are tons of guns. The game keeps score, and you can work as a team in 4-player; 2 on 2 combat! There are life vests to keep your health up, and the overall gameplay is good. I loved only one part of this game. it was the multiplayer!This game, overall, is a good game in terms of how much is costs (a twenty should cover it at most stores). Persounally, I'd buy it for the multiplayer, not the story mode. Something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer, or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two. This game is a blast in some ways, and a MAJOR disapointment in others. I plan on buying it...maybe (after renting it for a week).Thx!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

I am glad I decided to get this game for the Game Cube as I am pretty impressed with the overall game.The game starts off when link talking to someone while sitting at the bank of a river.  It's a long scene and because of the lack of voice acting you have to read what is being said.  This is really the only flaw to this game, but as you progress in the game, its not really that bad.  After the opening scene you are finally given control of Link and you are off on your newest Zelda adventure.I really don't feel like going through the plot of the game, but Zelda vets will know that regardless of the storyline, it's the same basic concept; find items, heart pieces and other things that will help your quest in addition exploring dungeons and defeating the dungeon boss etc. etc.  An interstig twist in this game is that now you are able to now turn into a wolf, I wasn't really a big fan of this, because I felt it slowed the game down, but that is just my opinion, its not too bad when I think about it and I guess it was just something I had to get used to.I am really impressed with the graphics on this game, even with only the standard yellow Video cable.  At first the game seemed a little blurry graphics wise, and obviously not as good as my X360's graphics, but a few adjustments to my TV display and the game looks VERY good.  I was thinking about getting the HD cable for my Game Cube, but for some reason Nintendo no longer sell it, and people on Ebay are taking advantage of this by gouging the price ($50+).  I would like the HD cable, but no way I'm paying that much for it, so I will settle for the standard video cable for now as the graphics are still pretty good.The sound is also good as well.  Some tunes are very familiar if you are a vet of the series and others are new.  One good thing about the BGM is that it seems to match the environment you are in.  The music at Lake Hylia actually sounds like \"lake music\" and the music played in Hyrule field sounds like someone walking alone through a vast field in the middle of the day with the sun shining in the distance.  This is not a big surprise because games like Zelda and Metroid have always had great musical soundtracks.  The sound of the enemies is also done pretty well, with a small complaint being that the roaring and ground stomping could have a little bit more bass.As I said in my title, the game is a VERY slow starter.  So slow in fact that after I defeated the first dungeon, I didn't play the game for a few weeks because it was quite tedious to me.  But I finally came back, and after I dealt with a little more tediousness, the game is finally starting open up; now I play it everyday when time allows.  In fact it's the only game I play right now, other than PGR3 and NBA2K7 on the Xbox 360.  Because the game is so vast with quite a few side quests, it's very easy to get overwhelmed with what you really have to do.  But your guide does a pretty good job in leading to what you have to do.  However you are still on your own when it comes to finding heart pieces, golden bugs and Poe spirits.  The only help you get in this department is a fortune teller that you eventually meet in the game, can give you some clue on where to find a heart piece for only 10 rupees.  The key to finding hidden items in Zelda is to observe EVERYTHING, pay particular attention to things that look out of place and you should do fine in this department.This game also has some pretty fun puzzles that will tease your brain.  And unlike Metroid Prime 2 which went WAY overboard with the puzzles, this game has the perfect blend of puzzles that flow along nicely with the game instead of frustrating you to no end.  My favorite puzzle so far is the one you have to do in order to get the Master Sword.  Sure you can look online for the solution, but its much more rewarding solving it yourself instead of taking the easy way out.  I solved it on my own as well as all the other puzzles in this game, and it's a very rewarding feeling.I've had this game for about 5 months now, and judging by my number of hearts, I am probably a little over halfway done.  I quite satisfied with the game, and it's my first Zelda game since Ocarina of Time on the N64.  I was planning on getting Majora's Mask, but never got around to it, and I really did not want to be disappointed comparing it to the greatness of OoT.  Also, even though people were saying how good Wind Waker was, I couldn't get over the cartoony graphics, and by the time I was thinking about getting WW, Twilight Princess was about to come out anyway.  While I still think Ocarina of Time is arguably the best Zelda game I've played, Twilight Princess is still a very good game, definitely worth a run through for Zelda vets and new comers alike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Injustice is good, but could have used more \"Kontent.\"","reviewText":"***updated for season pass viewpoints on bottom of review***Probably after the success of the last Mortal Kombat entry, Nether Realm thought that they would want to fix up a weird dimension they left afloat. I'm talking about the very strange and dismal Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe. At the same time, Injustice: Gods Among Us is a well constructed fighting game that introduces some new mechanics, it's also an awesome fan service for DC comics. Nether Realm claimed they were DC fans and wanted to create a game to help those \"who would win in a fight\" arguments among friends, no matter how far fetched they can still be. I've been playing this game since release and I can tell it must have been a labor of love for them.Core Noticeable Mechanics:\"Kombat\" will be familiar for people who did enjoy 2011's MK. Once again, no typical Capcom-over-the-top button move lists, but that doesn't mean the fighting will be tame. It's awesome to string together devastating combos using special moves and watching your opponent take a glorified beating.What returns definitely is the character meter. Get a quarter to half way you can enhance your special moves to hit harder and change the animations or use a way to save yourself from enemy combos. Build it all the way and unleash something like the infamous X-Ray moves from Mortal Combat, but more Epic and very DC oriented as they add more to the super hero action.Each character has their own unique special ability (the O on PS3 or B on XB360) that can provide varying defensive or offensive abilities.The backgrounds are awesome! Simply slamming your opponent down on the ground and you can see the devastation in the background. There are tons of interactive material in each stage that characters can use in different ways. Then there is something I haven't seen done in a fighting game since Mortal Kombat III. If you use your heavy attack at the right spot you can then launch your opponent into a level transition that is very animated and very brutal. I haven't seen them all, it's as if all 15 (or more) stages have at least two level transitions. These level transitions and interactive backgrounds can add strategy to the fight. If you don't like this idea, you can turn them off.The clash/wager system is interesting. Even I don't know who this fully works, but you can try to trigger a wager event to bet what energy you have obtained on your meter to either damage your opponent heavily or try to regain some lost health. At the same time this happens both fighters will spout dialogue that will change depending on the characters.The S.T.A.R. labs missions (much like the challenge tower) provide hours of distraction away from standard arcade and story mode. Once again these are varying challenges with 10 missions per character that provide DC comic references and weird fun. They can get ridiculously hard if you are trying to earn 3 stars per round.The usual online multiplayer is apparent and it feels the same as the previous MK with a level up system to unlock more items for your Hero Card that displays who you are to other players. Oh yeah, no matter what you do in the game, you get XP regardless and it is shared even in Multiplayer.The Arcade mode is dubbed \"Battles\" with the normal classic mode fight 10 opponents to unlock a character ending. Also you can unlock different types of battles via Archives as well, like mirror matches and fight at half health matches.Pros: Like Mortal Kombat (2011) this is also a better comic book fighting game than Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. The amount of single player content is apparently bigger providing more hours to play and fight with another person on local VS. There maybe not the same amount of characters, but the single player content helps justify Injustice's purchasing worth. See Capcom, THIS is what people want more out of a AAA fighting game.The DC character interactions in the Story or 1v1 matches are awesome. Having very familiar voices from the best Justice League cartoon return to their familiar roles is huge plus. This adds some great one liners for character dialogue interactions. Even though some voices are different, they still do a good job portraying their character. I still don't like the Arrow TV show, Stephen Amell did an awesome job as Green Arrow. Adam Baldwin sounded a bit too gruff for Green Lantern, but I ended up liking his voice. Despite what hardcore fans say, I think the new guy who does the Joker actually did a good job filling in Mark Hamil's shoes. I wouldn't mind this guy taking it over from now on. Aquaman voiced by Phil Lamar was a bit strange, but at least Bane does sounded like he's from South America...and clear.There are some great story bits that will make you will remember like humorous parts involving Green Lantern, Green Arrow, and Batman.The backgrounds, as ridiculous and brutal the transitions become, they are awesome to watch anytime. They make you want to pummel your opponent to the next area or use all of the gizmos laying around to make each match feel Original.Every character does feel different from each other. People who did play the last MK will probably call out similarities, but ultimately the fighters are very different adding more to this game's identity.Cons: Although the story was decent, (from a DC comics fan viewpoint) it was definitely short. In fact I think it's actually shorter than the last Mortal Kombat. Popular Video game critic websites claim that the story gets ridiculous. It does a bit, but if you haven't been reading DC comics for the past 40 years, then judging from the source material to construct this story, Injustice's story mode should be normal or at least expected to all DC fans. The huge problem I did have with it was if you lost a match, the game will then dumb down the AI for some reason. Nether Realm probably wanted people to experience the story no matter what. However, I thought it killed my buzz of actually trying to get to the next part through the challenge. But don't worry, there are 0 boss cheapness like Shao Kahn from the last Mortal Kombat. If that AI dumbing down feature was gone, the story would have lasted longer to me.The Archives are lacking compared to the last Mortal Kombat's Krpt. It would have been nice to have the ability to unlock another Super Move per character, making it worth to visit the Archives to unlock something more than the story mode costumes.Instead of rounds, there is only one and fighters have 2 health bars. Although this helps it differentiate from other games (except for Killer Instinct), but matches can become one sided very fast if you are not able retaliate in time.Some sort of offline King of the Hill Mode would have been awesome to have. But regardless, there is a good amount to test your might with local vs, online vs, and single player Battles.Some choices in the character roster are strange like Killer Frost, Raven, or Ares. Gorilla Grod, Martian Manhunter, Black Canary, there are so many that could have filled those two spots.The Strange: Phil Lamar voicing Aquaman. Depeche Mode playing in the credits?Despite it's flaws, Nether Realm definitely accomplished what they wanted to do with Injustice: Gods Among Us. If there was more added to the story and better unlockables available in the Archives, I would have rated this game a full 5 out 5 stars. It's easily an 8 to me if you want to judge it with review websites like Gamespot and Ign.com. For the first time ever, I purchased a season pass. As much as I hate these DLC gimmicks, I couldn't pass up having Lobo added to the fighter roster sometime soon. I would say content wise, it's worth more the $59.99 than how anything Capcom has released in the past years. But I advise for anybody who wants to a real DC superhero brawler, Injustice: God Among Us would definitely be worth a discounted price then.***DLC Update: Lobo was just released today and also some disappointment for those who did purchase the \"season pass.\" One would assume that by purchasing a season pass for a video game, the user will be able to obtain all of the DLC when released, correct? Wrong. Nether Realm and Injustice will point out that they never stated this. My reasoning why it sucks: In MK9, every new DLC character that was released, a compatibility pack was required and players received 3 character skins/costumes for free. So now, for Injustice: Gods Among Us, that is no longer the case here. Regardless if you bought the season pass, you only receive 1 (Flashpoint Batman) and you have to purchase the skin packs separately through the PSN or XBLive stores. I'm sorry, but paying $2.99 for a 3 skin pack each for the same animations and voices for characters is not worth the money. Maybe $2.99 for both packs (resulting with 6 total)...or I don't know FREE FOR THOSE WHO BOUGHT A SEASON PASS!?!?!? And I was hoping to have Teen Titans Cyborg and Raven :(.  For Lobo, he works great and is fun to play. But once again like what they did with MK9, he doesn't have an additional costume or any S.T.A.R. Labs missions or archives, or Hero badge customizations. Just the character like what they did with MK9. The other character announced is Batgirl with Zod and Scorpion from MK9 as rumors. Pretty disappointed with this season pass purchase. ***","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}

Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"This is how you do a Stealth Game","reviewText":"Dishonored is a new IP from developer Arkane Studios and is published by Bethesda. The game centers on Corvo, Lord Protector to the Empress of Dunwall and her daughter Emily. Corvo is framed for murdering the Empress, though, and her daughter ends up missing. When Corvo mysteriously escapes prison thanks to a group who knows he's been the scapegoat for a corrupt political system, his chance to set things right is handed to him on a silver platter.What ends up ensuing is a game with incredible gameplay that lets the player traverse the city of Dunwall however they like. While the game is nowhere near perfect, this is exactly how the ideal stealth game should play/feel. I think Dishonored is something all stealth games of the past tried to be but never could quite achieve. Let's break a few things down...GAMEPLAY:Single-handedly the absolute best part about Dishonored. Take one part Mirror's Edge and one part Assassin's Creed, sprinkle in some BioShock, and finally mix it all into a bowl of Deus Ex: HR, and you'll arrive here. The game is comprised of seven missions (not including a prologue) where Corvo must go through an area and take out a target. It prides itself on giving the player ultimate freedom in terms of how you get to said target, how you take them out, and how you deal with hostiles along the way. You can go in guns ablazin', sneak up and assassinate, be a completely unnoticed ghost who doesn't kill, or some combination of all those things. In that way, the game is going to feel largely similar to Deus Ex: HR, and I can tell you if you enjoyed that game you'll likely enjoy Dishonored. Be careful with how you deal with those you encounter -- killing leads to high chaos, translating to a more hostile city (you'll see what I mean) and a dark ending. If you do opt to keep your hands clean for the 'good' ending as well as some of the rarer achievements, you'll want to be careful here, too, as unconscious bodies can be killed by things like rats. Part of the game's mechanic is supernatural abilities, such as Blink (teleporting), Stop Time, and more. As you can imagine, there are a plethora of ways these can help you fulfill your path to the right thing or indulge your inner hitman.Aside from the combat, half the fun is finding out how to get inside a building/to an area. Do you like running along the rooftops? You can do that. How about running straight in, gunning everyone down as you stroll directly to your target? You could do that, too. Would you even like to possess an animal to utilize an underground/underwater tunnel? That's another option here! Seriously, there's usually anywhere between 3-5 ways to get to a given location, so those of you who like to explore your options will have a hay-day.ATMOSPHERE:So if this game is so insanely fun and it's the best stealth game and blah-blah-blah, why only 4-stars, right? Well, the reason is outside of the gameplay it relies so heavily upon, everything else doesn't quite live up to the hype. Take Dunwall, for instance. I loved the Steampunk-London-style setting, and I really liked the cel-shaded graphics/textures that make the city have a watercolor vibe. However, Dunwall didn't feel alive like Rapture (BioShock) or the Ishimura (Dead Space). The audio balance was off as some actions were very loud, while some pieces of dialogue ended up being so quiet I had to turn up my volume. The audiographs felt both out of place and like a slight ripoff of the radio logs in BioShock. Take this audio imbalance to the whole world you're jumping around in; the immersion can be broken very easily. If you look at other reviews, though, some people felt the opposite, so I may just be a bit picky here when it comes to atmosphere.STORY:Here's another area that ended up feeling a bit underwhelming. The game started off at an excellent pace, and the 'framed Protagonist in a politically-driven hierarchy' here laid an awesome foundation for an epic tale. The rest of the story just didn't execute through in a compelling way. Sure, my heart did get tugged around at certain points. Yes, I did personally feel the need to assassinate a target for their involvement in the plot. As a whole, though, it's just lacking the proverbial oomph you find in game likes The Witcher 2, Mass Effect, and the like. But I don't want you to get the wrong idea. The story here is good; it is a solid one from beginning to end. Just don't expect grand character development or superb narrative techniques.REPLAYABILITY:Let's get back in the upswing. Replayability is another huge factor for why you should invest in this game. As I mentioned before, there's a prologue and seven missions. I like to explore, and by the end of the third mission I clocked in 16 hours. If you're like me and you like to explore, expect to have about 2-4 hours in each mission while you take in everything, do side-quests, etc. This means in a single playthrough you're going to get 15-20 hours in, which isn't bad for your wallet. Something else to consider (especially if you're someone who likes to get achievements) if that you literally can't do everything in a single playthrough. There's two endings, meaning two playthroughs at least. There are a handful of weapons and a handful of powers to toy with for hours. And seriously, if you do want to get every achievement, you'll have to play-through the game twice (perhaps thrice even). On the other side of the spectrum, what others have said is true: if you're the cowboy-whippersnapper who plays single-player games CoD-style, you'll likely finish missions in about 20 minutes to an hour each. While that may seem short, take into consideration the fact you can breeze through the game again with a completely different setup to get more hours and more bang for the buck.I got this game for $25 on Black Friday, so I know I got my money's worth. But if you're the type of gamer (like me) who likes to immerse yourself in a game's universe, absorbing the details and exploring at your leisure, I wouldn't hesitate in saying this game is worth $60. That aside, if you're a stealth junkie, you really should click the order button now. This is AAA stealth gameplay, and I don't think we'll see something like it in a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Decent action, decent story, decent visuals, overall: decent","reviewText":"FEAR 2 is the sequel to FEAR, obviously.  Time-line wise, unless I'm mistaken, it takes place just prior to and just after the bomb goes off.  I can't remember if you are the same character or not, and it really doesn't matter.  You don't even need to know anything about the first game to enjoy this one, although it doesn't hurt.FEAR 2 is a first person shooter with no frills other than a slow-mo \"bullet time\" style power.  The atmosphere (audio/visual) is pretty good, and remains sort of spooky and claustrophobic most of the time.  There are some levels that stand out, and for me those were the ones in the destroyed urban setting.  The enemy AI isn't too sharp, but doesn't do a bad job of moving around and attempting to flank.  They sure do like to use cover.  Rest assured, there is no shortage of enemies.  There's a very short turret/gunride style section, a few little powered armor type sections, but mostly it's pretty standard fps fare.  The game goes by pretty quickly, but I could see cranking up the difficulty and replaying it.  I've played it through on normal and I have found it to be not that much of a challenge.I have not explored any of the multiplayer functionality, so I can't comment on that.Overall, the game is nothing ground breaking but certainly isn't a waste of time.  I've enjoyed it immensely, and while I'm not sure about the $44 price, it isn't a bad game.

{"product_name":"B001C4C4KW","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Great Addition to the Series (4.5 Stars)","reviewText":"Pros:+A lot of good gameplay+An overall charming story+Lots of things to do off the beaten path+A Huge emphasis on strategy+Well done anime inspired artCons:-Still a few problems with the camera-By now the graphics need an improvement to better bring the story to life.  The anime inspired art is really nice, but how about an anime scene or two to really convey a character's feelings or actions?  Beyond that, the battlefield and character sprites look exactly like they did in the first two games.  A graphical update would've been really nice.In 2003, Disgaea came out and breathe some new life into the Tactical Strategy RPG.  It quickly became a cult classic.  Disgaea 2 came around and stayed true to the first by changing very little.  In that sense, Disgaea 3 can be summed up as being a continuation of the things that worked in the first two games.  If you enjoyed the first two Disgaea games, then you'll like Disgaea 3.Disgaea 3 focuses on Mao as he tries to overthrow is Overlord of a father for destroying his game console.  It's a joke of a story but it's meant to be such.  In all honesty it isn't much of a bad story at all once it gets going.  The story is told through still shots of the characters facing one another as the dialog pops up on screen.  There's voice acting, although some of it is quite forgettable.  But there's also a good sense of humor, mainly because the story doens't take itself so seriously.  Disgaea 3 knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more.  It makes the overall experience of it fun and satisfying.  But as the story progresses it actually becomes about so much more than a mere broken Slaystation Portable.The story is charming overall, but the presentation of it isn't so much.  Certainly character portraits carrying the story out isn't so bad, but by now Disgaea should be willing to take its production values to new levels with the Playstation 3.  An anime cutscene or something to help bring some of the more dramatic moments to life would've been really nice.Battling in Disgaea 3 is no different than it was in the previous two games.  You move characters around the battlefield executing attacks.  Disgaea has always had a huge emphasis on strategy mainly because of the Geo Panels.  Depending on the placement of Geo Panels and the placement of Geo Blocks, characters can be granted certain bonuses ranging from an attack boost to even some that aren't going to help you at all such a hindrance to your defense.  Disgaea 3 also brings back the bonus gauge where after a battle you can get certain bonuses depending on how much damage you've done or how many panels you've destroyed.  Even by the third installment, the Geo Panels system manages to be unique.  The Geo Panels also help to make a difference in your strategy.  You'll find your level doesn't mean much if the enemy you're facing has a huge boost by the Geo Panel he's standing on.Disgaea 3 also keeps the level cap incredibly high.  You can go all the way up to level 9999.  It might seem like the game puts more emphasis on level and brute force, but chances are you'll find there's still a lot of strategy involved in the game, and that's mainly because there's so much outside of the story to do, and the Geo Panels provide a neat puzzle element to the game.The biggest problem, however, is that it doesn't look any different from the first two games.  You're basically getting a Playstation 2 game on a Playstation 3 console.  Tactical Strategy RPGs have never been the best looking games, but Disgaea 3, despite being on the Playstation 3, looks almost exactly the same as the first two games.  There isn't a real noticeable improvement in the game's artistic or graphical design.  The anime inspired character portraits are very nice and detailed, but the overall look of the game isn't much.  It also still suffers from the camera angles.  While you can rotate the camera you'll find that there's not much else you can do with it.  Pillars and other environmental objects will still be in the way.Disgaea 3 is a good game.  Excellent for Disgaea fans.  It may play the same way, but that isn't a bad thing at all.  What may not settle well with some gamers, however, is that it's a Playstation 3 game that would've been better suited for the Playstation 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

As you may have already seen through searches and screenshots, it looks absolutely amazing.For a review in short, it is everything you loved about Morrowind.  Open ended quests, huge environments, customizable classes and characters and a game you can loose weeks on and never miss them at all.It also fixes everything you hated about Morrowind.  Goodbye useless quest log and the need to wander the same roads over and over again.  The journal system is completely redone and allows quick access to the paths of a specific quest you want to work on.  Also, the fast travel feature makes moving between places you previously visited as simple as clicking.While the true requirements of this game may be a bit heavy computerwise, you see every bit of it put to work.  The landscapes are amazing to the point of making postcards out of them.  For those who own computers not quite up to snuff, there are mods out there to improve performance for slower machines as well.I have been playing this game for several weeks now and have barely scratched the surface.  And, for people who blow through it quickly or get bored easily, it gets even better.  The fan created mods for this game are amazing.  If you dislike the leveled enemy system (as one reviewer obviously does) the are at least three different mods out there which can adjust the leveling system and enemy difficulty system in ways to make the game more suitable for you.If you dislike the system of hiding behind a shield and wacking the monsters here and there, go and get one of the improved combat mods.  You will find yourself able to backflip, shieldbash, dodge and more.The list of fan based improvements goes on and on, but you see the point.

{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Magical In So Many Ways","reviewText":"In the year 2000, Squaresoft was pretty much at the top of its game.  In that year they had a string of successes with games like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy IX all dropping by for some time.  Strangely enough one of the most overlooked games during that time was a little gem called Vagrant Story.  Helmed by Yasumi Matsuno (better known as the mind behind Final Fantasy Tactics), it was a game that he knew from the moment it came out would only appeal to a particular crowd.  Vagrant Story wasn't for everyone.  Indeed, many a gamer either couldn't get into it or downright hated it.  Those who did get into it, however, fell in love with the game.  Matsuno has always had that &#34;You'll love it or hate it,&#34; appeal.  This may also be because Matsuno's approach to designing a game has always been &#34;different&#34; than the typical developer.  There's no game in Matsuno's library that is as complex as Vagrant Story, however.  If you can get into it it's a rewarding and challenging experience.  Patience is required but for the time of its release it was probably one of the most reaching and original games out there.Vagrant Story is set in Valendia.  A cult lead by a man named Sydney have abducted the Duke's son and taken him to the abandoned city of Lea Monde.  As Ashley Riot, your job is to infiltrate the city, find the Duke's son and stop the evil cultists.  Throughout the journey you'll also run into the Crimson Blades who are also out to stop Sydney for their own reasons.  As Ashley enters the city of Lea Monde he gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse with Sydney, who has a mysterious power to see into the past of his victims.  As you play through the game there are many moments of betrayal and characters out to serve their own ends.  It seems like a simple story at first, but as you dive deeper in it becomes more complex and engaging.  Though there are moments when it's slow, Vagrant Story isn't exactly long enough to mind some of its pacing problems, the likes of which are slowed down less by the actual progression of the story and more by the actual gameplay itself.In the year 2000 most JRPGs were the same old typical turn based stuff.  Allies lined up on one side, the enemy on the other.  Vagrant Story does away with that.  Instead it takes on a more active approach to its combat.  You can walk around in normal mode or battle mode.  In normal mode your weapon is sheathed, as is your shield.  In Battle Mode you are ready for combat at any time.  Enemies roam around the map freely.  Vagrant Story fashions itself as a dungeon crawler.  Many dungeons are quite big.  When you enter a room there are usually two or three enemies.  When you engage them in combat you must bring up a battle sphere (referred to as a matrix).  Upon doing so you can select a different part of the body to attack.  Either their right arm, left arm, legs, body or head.  Each one affects different stats in some way and has its own HP listing.  For instance, if you keep attacking an enemies legs you'll reduce their movement.  Keep attacking their primary arm and their attack goes down.  Keep attacking the head and they'll eventually be silenced.  Keep attacking the body and their defenses drop.You can also chain together attacks by setting them to different buttons.  The more you chain attacks together the greater damage you'll do.  Some chain abilities are designed for damage output but others are designed to restore HP or MP while others may silence or paralyze an opponent.  Chain attacks take time to master, however.  Each time your weapon strikes an enemy you have a brief second to hit a button.  If your timing is correct Ashley winds up for another strike.  Hit the button too early or too late and the chain stops.  While it's easy to chain attacks together, the game makes sure you don't take advantage of it by giving you a stat known as Risk.  When your Risk is low your is high and you take less damage.  As your Risk increases your accuracy drops and you take more damage.  On the other hand Risk does have its upsides.  You have a better chance of landing critical strikes and your healing magic will heal far more HP.  So you can take your chances.  Your accuracy is lower but your damage output (if you hit) is higher.  You take more damage but you can also recover more damage.There are also defense abilities at play that work exactly as you think.  When an enemy strikes you, just hit the button corresponding to the defense ability set to it and Ashley defends himself.  As with chain abilities the timing is important.  Some defense abilities allow you to reflect damage, others let you absorb HP and others are just meant to help your defense against certain elemental attacks.Vagrant Story has a deeper system than most games and we've only scratched the surface of what it is.  Certainly there are also various magic spells but they're used in the standard fare you would imagine them to be used in.  First you use a grimoire and then Ashley will master the spell.  Some require specific targeting but for the most part there's little complex about using magic in Vagrant Story.  What is complex, however, is keeping so many things in the background in mind.  For instance, every enemy has a class they fall into.  Human, Dragon, Beast, Phantom, Undead or Evil.  And they're all weak to a very specific weapon type.  We're not talking swords or anything like that.  We're talking either edged, blunt or piercing weapons.  Likewise, you also must pay attention to the elemental affinity of a weapon you're using.  Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Evil and Light.  It seems like a lot to take in at first... and it very much is.  Using the right weapon against an enemy makes the difference between dealing a lot of damage or dealing no damage at all.The good news is that all of this can easily be manipulated through the games various systems.  You might start with a sword that doesn't deal a lot of damage to humans at all... but the more you use it the better it will be against human type enemies.  You can raise any weapons attack against a certain class just by using it on that class.  Thus, you do more damage the more you use a weapon.  Likewise, as you go through the game you'll find various gems to attach to a weapon as well to help improve how much damage you can do to a class.  Some enemies have elemental weaknesses as well which you can also attach gems to your weapon to exploit.  It's not just your weapons, but your shields as well.  You can easily attach a gem to a shield to improve your defenses against various classes and affinities as well.  All this amounts to a fairly complex game when you consider all of this.  But it also means that you'll find yourself constantly micromanaging throughout your journey.  You'll enter one dungeon where a weapon you've obtained and attached gems to works really well only to enter another dungeon where you have to change all of it.  It is certainly possible to go through Vagrant Story with just a single weapon, but you'll feel the need to change it up eventually.  Not only do all those class and affinity matches matter, but eventually you'll want a weapon made out of a different material as well.  You start with a lot of Bronze and Iron stuff that affects class and affinity damage, but you'll also find yourself using better material later that deals greater damage with little or no penalties at all.Vagrant Story is actually a game that, if you grind enough, can be really balanced with its complex weapon system.  Every weapon has the ability to grow its class and affinity damage.  And wouldn't you know it, Vagrant Story makes sure you CAN do this.  Later in the game you'll come across various workshops that will allow you to make and combine your own weapons.  You could easily make a weapon that deals heavy damage to every class and affinity type in the game.  It takes a lot of grinding, but it can happen.What's nice, however, is that outside of the boss encounters the game isn't too punishing.  If an enemy is weaker to a blunt type weapon but you prefer your edge type the damage isn't nearly as well affected as your class and affinity are.  Even so, however, there are lots of spells that can be used to boost any affinity you're lacking or that can be used to strengthen your attacks and equipment.  Likewise, you'll have plenty of spells that can decrease your enemies stats as well.Unlike most games, Vagrant Story wants you to learn and utilize every bit of its system.  Particularly in its boss encounters where knowing the class and elemental affinity of your opponent is your key to victory.  Vagrant Story is a challenging game, but only to those who do not understand the mechanics of the system.  If you're fighting a water elemental enemy for instance, just boosting your attack and casting a spell that boosts your weapons fire affinity (as well as having the proper gems) will save the day.  If, however, you're not willing to micro manage and prepare for each boss, Vagrant Story is more than happy to punish you for it.  This is not a game where just knowing the basics will help you succeed.  This is a game that expects you to actually learn and utilize the system at play and isn't going to hold your hand to get you there.  If you aren't willing to read the game's instruction manual (or willing to read the Quick Manual in the game itself) then you'll find Vagrant Story to be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.  If, however, you spend the time to learn the complexities of the system, Vagrant Story is surprisingly easy.  The most challenging boss won't be a match if you understand what to do.About the only thing that might hold you up is that Vagrant Story is large and sprawling.  The dungeons are huge, but more than that, the game isn't always telling you where to go next.  You'll often come across locked doors that you need to have a certain key or sigil for.  And when you get that key or sigil you'll need to find the door itself.  The good news is that while the game won't guide you back there, it has lots of tools to give you an idea of where you can or cannot go.  Each sigil has flavor text that tells you which dungeon it can be used it while the in game map always marks locked and unlockable doors for you.  Again, if you're not willing to utilize the system you'll be hopelessly lost.  You may still get lost, however.  While you'll know which doors can and cannot be passed through thanks to your map, the game still doesn't tell you WHERE you need to go a lot of the time.  There's a lot to explore in Lea Monde at least.  It's a huge game where there are lots of things to do off the beaten path.  Going back to old dungeons and grabbing equipment from otherwise locked chests or rooms is nice.  It's a shame, however, that most of Vagrant Story's best optional content is saved for after completing your journey.  Much of what you do must be done in a New Game+.  Many of the optional bosses and optional dungeons can only be played on replay.  While this sounds like a chore at first, it's remarkable how fast Vagrant Story moves.  Your first play through may take a moment because you're getting lost, but once you've experienced it once you'll come to learn that Vagrant Story is a pretty short game.  In a New Game+ you'll find these new areas pretty quickly and they'll keep you busy for a while.Vagrant Story is close to perfect for its design.  For everything that seems like it'll give you trouble there is an opposite solution that will always work for you.  However, beyond its complexities what you realize is that Vagrant Story is most certainly not for the fast paced gamer.  It's short, but it won't feel short the first time through.  The battle system will make everything feel slow.  The combat always stops so that your enemies can cast spells and in some cases this is a lot.  Combat may seem very active, but at some point it's the same turn based affair you've always known.  But when enemies and characters take certain action everything stops while it's being executed.  This is not an action/adventure RPG, it's very much just an RPG.  In moments where all you want to do is get through the dungeon without engaging your enemies in combat this is particularly annoying as you'll always be stopped so they can have their attack.  Likewise, as a result of this you'll often have to stop and take a moment to heal any sustained damage.  While it's nice that your HP and MP will regenerate in normal mode, enemies are going to do damage quite fast when you're not interrupting their blows with your own (and even the normal enemies can do quite a bit of damage).Other times Vagrant Story can feel downright unfair.  When I mention about having to really prepare for boss fights or else the game will punish you?  I'm not joking.  There will be bosses that, without the right preparation will take you down with a single cast of a spell.  Other times enemies will employ some strangely strategic tactics to make sure you don't stand a chance.  If you aren't willing to utilize the tools the game gives you it's not going to be a rewarding experience.  In an interview Matsuno described the game as being for &#34;hardcore&#34; players (a definition that has certainly changed from what Matsuno meant then) and he is certainly correct in that regard.  Vagrant Story is a game that the player can't hope to succeed in without fully understanding the systems at play, and the learning curve is a pretty steep one.  Many video games really ease you into things and make things quite easy in the event that not everything clicks for you immediately.  Vagrant Story knows no such forgiveness.  As such many a gamer is probably turned away from Vagrant Story because of its complexities.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, a lot of micromanaging to do and a lot of preparation that comes before every boss at a certain point.  All this culminates into what is still widely seen as a very complex game.  In some instances, without the aid of a walkthrough (at least for bosses) Vagrant Story can appear to be needlessly challenging without understanding the fundamentals of the game.Even for hardcore players, however, some of the micromanaging can be a bit much.  There will be stretches where you'll feel like you're spending more time in the menu than actually exploring and playing the game.  As you use various weapons and grow fond of a favorite this will ease off, but until that point Vagrant Story is pretty strict about it's combat system and is surprisingly meticulous.  There isn't room for a lot of error and sometimes this can be grating to those new to Vagrant Story.  Even intimidating at times.  Many of Square's other games are far more accessible than Vagrant Story.As I said, however, once learned Vagrant Story is a surprisingly easy game.  In fact, it can be a little too easy to get overpowered when you realize just how combining weapons and raising affinities really works.  So much so that it can be really easy to take advantage of it.  Once you know what class and affinity you're dealing with Vagrant Story is a pushover.  To make sure you can't get too overpowered, Vagrant Story has limited inventory space.  You can't simply run around with all your weapons.  Eventually your weapon inventory gets full and you'll be forced to dump a few in a container.  The same goes for armor and other items.  It surprisingly balances the game, but once again, can be a big hassle for those who aren't particularly big on micromanagement.As far as Playstation games go, Vagrant Story was among the best looking ones out there.  Certainly games like Chrono Cross look a little better, but Vagrant Story, especially for all it does at a time, is quite a good looking game for its time.  The art style is very nice.  What really makes it work is the tone that goes along with everything.  It's a very dramatic story.  The dialog is some of the best written in any game Square has ever published.  The presentation is just overall very nice.  The dark and dreary tone is enhanced by the soundtrack which is just as magical, dramatic and dark as the game itself.  Everything about the presentation gives you an idea as to what kind of world you're stepping into.  This isn't a lighthearted fantasy.  A great deal of JRPGs have a tendency to go the more adolescent or more juvenile route with a lot of themes and intrigue, but Vagrant Story doesn't do any such thing.  Many characters are put in situations that feel hopeless at times.  It's a dark story filled with betrayal and political intrigue and it will shove this in your face.  And there are A LOT of politics in Vagrant Story.  And the deeper you dive into the story, the more interesting it gets as revelations are unveiled and character motivations come to light.Vagrant Story is not a game for everyone.  It simply is not.  It's complexities and micromanagement systems can make the experience tedious for some players, while others may be turned away by how difficult the game will be without understanding them--especially because the game will punish you for neglecting to learn any of it.  This isn't a game where you learn the basics and keep going.  This is a game where you MUST dig into the systems and the mechanics because it's unrelenting if you don't.  However, those willing to dive and learn the system will see a Playstation game unlike any other they've ever experienced.  With a great story, some great localization and a very creative battle system, Vagrant Story is a hidden treasure.  It may not be simple and it may not fashion itself approachable, but the more you get to know it, the more charming it becomes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Resident Evil still thrives in this refreshing new entry.","reviewText":"Resident Evil has grown infamous for help starting the Survival Horror genre of video games.  Over the years each installment has added something new to the series while continuing to make each game progressively creepier.  With the onslaught of Konami's Silent Hill series (which I also love), it was high time Capcom created another Resident Evil game.  Although I did appreciate the remake of the original (which was less corny and scarier than the original PSX version) and the prequel Resident Evil Zero, I had still craved for a \"new\" installment.  Resident Evil 2 was my favorite game in the series and we already got to see more of Claire in \"Code Veronica,\" but I couldn't help but yearn for a game explaining what happened to Ada, why Wesker was still alive, and what had become of Leon.  And while all those questions weren't answered, what we got is in my eyes one of the most refreshing new games in the series.  Resident Evil is still Resident Evil, but with a lot of changes and probably the creepiest and most insane it's ever achieved.  It's like the creators wanted to add a little bit of Silent Hill influence into the formula.You play as Leon Kennedy from RE2, six years after the events in that game (yes, the first RE game to NOT take place in 1998!).  He's now a CIA agent in search of the President's daughter, who was kidnapped and brought to some remote place in Europe.  What he finds is a crazy village filled with possessed people who aren't \"quite\" zombies and a mysterious cult called the Los Illuminados, led by Lord Saddler.  Leon also meets Luiz, a renegade who apparently worked for Saddler but cured the infection in his body (both Leon and the President's daughter, Ashley, have been infected with the new virus).  This new virus is a morphing of the virus presented in Resident Evil Zero in which the host no longer decays and is still one smart cookie (oh yes, and one of the villains, he's sort of the \"NeoTyrant\" of this game).  He must get her out safely before they use her as a \"sacrifice\" in which she would return fully infected to the United States, causing a worldwide infection and possible World War.  Ada's also back, and she's after the new virus sample (and in case you hadn't played Code Veronica, Wesker is somehow still alive and trying to bring Umbrella back).  That's pretty much the summation of the story, which is actually a pretty good one.I can't really say much negative about this game.  Capcom did it right, and here I was concerned that they would mess up like with Mega Man X.  But no, not only did they make it scarier with the environment, they also made the enemies a LOT smarter.  The zombies here will run at you yelling satanic curses in Spanish and we also run into some enemies that will fill your screen.  At one point you fight El Gigante, a large Troll-like creature that was probably rejected from Lord of the Rings (haha), and at another you fight two simultaneously.  And another boss you fight is a giant fish/sea monster thing.  The list goes on and on.  Capcom also put the camera behind Leon's shoulder so the camera view changes as you move, similar to Silent Hill.  While I don't knock the originals for their set camera angles, I found this device much easier to work with in this type of game.  Another aspect of the game that you MUST remember is to NEVER put your controller down during a cut scene.  At times during cut scenes (and in particular, a knife fight towards the end), you have to press L+R or A+B simultaenously to avoid getting hurt or even killed.You also don't automatically target like the originals; this one uses laser sighting on all your weapons.  Speaking of weapons, there are various weapons in this game you can buy and customize (You'll love the shotgun in this game, especially upgraded).  The game also utilizes a buying/selling system in which you upgrade your weapons and also buy new weapons along the way.  A first for Resident Evil.After completing the game, you can play a sidequest as Ada, in which she obtains some samples for Wesker, and a Mercenaries game which is like in RE2.  I had found many pleasing reviews from most people and magazines and I am grateful to see that.  This game adds a lot of new elements to the franchise, but also holds onto the elements that have made Resident Evil so enjoyable.  This game is the most INSANE Resident Evil game yet, and is certainly a worthy addition to the legacy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2005"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

The main disappointment for me was the graphics while I was not expecting the greatest seeing these cheap and poorly rendered RE zombie knockoffs was a joke as well as the weapons and scenery while moving around the levels of the game.  The next problem I felt was the game has you play like it WAS the arcade version which means that you can't continue on after all the credits your characters have are used up after being killed which means after you used the four to seven credits and your character dies you have to start the game from the very beginning.  The final problem was the voice actors they got for the game they were so awful I wished I could turn their voices off during game play and just read the subtitles you could tell they were just reading from their scripts with no feeling what so ever it was very sad and pathetic.  You can upgrade your characters health points somewhat as well as get more credit pointswith the game extras and there are some small extras as well but I just felt that their not worth mentioning.  Also I have to say unlike with theRE Umbrella Chronicles game this game gives you no control of the camera angles so you can't really look around for any hidden items as much as you could with REUC  you do sometimes get to pick which direction you want to go but All In All there won't be much of a difference which way you go.  So if you like shooting games for the Wii and for a reasonableprice this might be for you but if you are looking for any thing else in the game I say wait for another game to come your way...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2008"}

Then recently developed an interest in it and bought it somehow knowing that I would love it, and I indeed cannot stop playing this game.pros-The detail is awesome, and the world is beautifully crafted.  Scary enemies.  The controls are simple.  Action is great.  Weapons are great.  Interesting story. Co-op is awesome, full split widescreen (not like halo3). Interesting puzzles break up the monotony/ linear design. Realistic AI, they duck, hide, charge, advance, jump, cover. The game is very original, its like nothing I have played before.cons-Wait and watch the intro.  The game just starts without any background. Just wait on the main screen and after a couple minutes watch the video about what happened to this world.  Teammate quirks-sometimes your teammate Dom will get hung up on something and he wont proceed further.  You end up fighting by yourself wondering where your partner is.  If there is a straight line to walk, open area, teammate AI's will jump over everything, even if its not in the way.  It causes them to grunt and groan thinking there is a monster behind you. The command button to give your teammates orders DOES NOT WORK! Sometimes they proceed to run into the heat of the battle, get killed and then you have to go after them and save them.  Try and prevent them from rushing by commanding them to regroup, sometimes they obey, other time it's \"No can do!\" frustrating.This one map Dom kept walking out in the open and would  killed by the bat things and I would have to start 10 minutes back at the last checkpoint. Sux. NO MANUAL SAVES, just auto saves.Very linear. The paths are obvious, leading to set-up battle areas. The gameplay is long, although the plot does not seem to thicken.The action, originality, and AI are so awesome that every con I've listed is minuscule to the Pro's.

Origins was great, and Legends takes the series even further.It feels like they've added a lot of ideas from the recent hit Rayman Jungle Run mobile app to Legends, changing the feel of what might have been a somewhat typical platformer.  They have added JILLIONS of bonus stages, challenges, awards and goals, many of which are speed based.  There's even a Daily Challenge, where you try to accomplish a goal with the best score or time.  It's a lot of content packed in.  There are multiple characters to unlock, along with the stages, adding a bit of variety.  Some of the speed design, and constant retries, reminded me of Runner 2 or Super Meat Boy.I'll say this though... Legends is HARD.  You could probably plow through most of the stages in a rush, and it would still ramp up the difficulty as you go, but part of the fun is exploring the little nooks and crannys and going after those collectibles that are JUST... OUT...OF...REACH!!! I unlocked several new levels fairly quickly, but was compelled to stay on each level, even on each stage, until I had found every collectible and aced the stage.For kids, it might be a little on the challenging side, but Legends is constantly rewarding you, and there are more opportunities for success here than in Origins.  The art and design are gorgeous and eye catching.  I actually like that they're challenging the 'hardcore' platform fans with old school challenges.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2013"}

It maintains the same tradition of stealth over run-and-gun as its splinter cell predecessors.  No doubt, this game is worth renting.  But you should be able to beat it before it's due back at Blockbusters.Now for the gripes:First, the multiplayer is nothing short of retarded.  In the previous incarnations, super cool spies battled it out against mean mercenaries.  Now the spies and mercs look like bald goons.  I don't generally care about silly looking character models; but they're extremely goofy looking in this game.  The big difference, and one that it seems everyone is complaining of, is that spies have very little offensive options against mercs.  In past games, spies could at least stun them with a stun gun or launch a smoke grenade in their direction.  Now spies have no guns, and can only carry one (that's right, one) gadget - like the smoke grenade or flash grenade.  While previous titles made multiplayer such an integral part that it really made the game worth buying, the multiplayer on DA is stupid, unbalanced, and no fun whatsoever to play.The single-player story is more or less the same gameplay as previous splinter cell games.  The \"trust\" meter thing is pretty silly and it basically goes up or down depending on whether or not you complete primary and secondary objectives.  It adds nothing to the game.The mini-games are a nice addition.  I'm starting to wonder if all games will have mini-games one day.  At any rate, the ones in DA are a bit on the difficult side; but not so aggravatingly so to make you throw the controller.I was a big fan of the original trilogy of splinter cell on x-box.  But with a short story and a real let-down in the multiplayer department, this will be the first splinter cell title that I will NOT be buying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2006"}

Johnson","summary":"I didn't like it.","reviewText":"I originally got DA for the regular XBOX, and played a few levels.  I thought it was pretty good, but not as good as past Splinter Cells.  When I finally got a 360 I decided to trade my XBOX version of DA for the 360 version.  This turned out to be a mistake, and shortly after playing the 360 version of the game, I wanted my XBOX on back.First off the levels in the 360 version are different than the regular XBOX version.  This is OK in itself, but to me the levels are just so boring an do not make much sense.  To me it seems that the level were just thrown together with no thought on how things would play out when someone actually played the level.  A good example is the first \"real\" level at the JBA headquarters.  You had to do a couple of things for the NSA, and to do this you had to find time to go to a restricted area to plant some bugs.  Your main task was for the JBA to go through a pretty simple obstacle course and open a safe at the end, all of which takes 4 minutes.  However you are given 15 minutes to complete the task.  How convienient, plenty of time to plant bugs.  And what makes this worse, even after you finished your tasks for the JBA and NSA you will more than likely have 3 or 4 minute left, and then you HAVE to wait those 3 or 4 minutes IN REAL time for the guy to come check on you.  How lame can you get? Its a complete waste of time.  I blew it off, because it was one of the first levels, but the next levels I played were just as boring.Another thing that I found missing was the many of the cool things you could do or had access to in past Splinter Cell games is not in DA for the 360.  Even the Xbox version has these things, but the 360 version does not.  Example, you cannot remote hack, you don't have the visibility and sound meters on your opsat, the enemy tracker in your 3D map does not show enemy positions in real time, its only a snapshot; so if the enemy is walking, you won't see it on your map.  the regular XBOX version of th game has this, why not the 360 version?  I don't know if you can do the split jump or not, but I never had an opportunity to try it.  You can unlock different gadgets by completing tasks without getting detected by the enemy, but why not have them in the game to begin with?  It just makes the game more frustrating.  One thing I hate about video games, is when they make you unlock stuff that should already be in the game.One of the only good things about this game was the graphics and sound.  But even the sound seemed to mess up during the gameplay.  Without warning the sound of enemy talk and weapons firing would go out and you couldn't hear anything except of the enviroment itself and sometimes the background music. In addition to this, my game has frozen a few times without warning, forcing me to start over.  Another strike.The game itself played OK, the controls were pretty responsive for the most part but even that messed up.  When the sound started going out, your controls seemed to be affected as well, and there was a slight delay when firing your weapon.One final thing about the gameplay that was pretty corny in my opinion, is that you have this stupid light on your suit that shows green when noone sees you, but as soon as an enemy sees you it turns red.  Why is this nesccesary?  This was not in previous splinter cell games, and I think a good reason for that is that it's not needed and it looks stupid.  It's just more proof that this game was just thrown together without any real thought into actual gameplay.I thought I would never give a Splinter Cell game a bad review, but the XBOX 360 version of this game gave me no choice.  I finally had enough, so I returned the game back to the store for a full refund. (Thank goodness I bought it used).  I had to rebuy my traded game back for the lower used price, but that was OK with me.  So instead of getting the full cost for DA for the 360 back, I only netted 20 bucks.  Its still OK with me though, because I wasn't at all happy with the 360 version.  I am back to the regular XBOX version of the game, and I couldn't be happier.If you have or thinking about getting Double Agent for the regular XBOX, keep it!  To me the 360 version is a huge dissapointment and I encourage others to stick with the more polished regular XBOX version.I gave this game 3 stars overall, which was very generous, if this was my first Splinter Cell game, it would definetely be a 2.  My review for the regular XBOX version of this game is coming soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2006"}

Stunning graphics, special effects and relentless, action-packed gameplay all combine to redefine this action epic.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A great and unique addition to the Onimusha series","reviewText":"I like this game a lot. It brings something new to the table for the Onimusha series, specifically much more in depth RPG elements and a MUCH longer and involved story. The gameplay is very similar to the previous games, but also adds new elements: some good, some not so good. This game takes place roughly 15 years after Onimusha 3: Demon Siege where Nobunaga's right hand man Tokichiro Kinoshita, now known as Hideyoshi Toyotomi, has ruled over Japan after his master's fall. Surprisingly, it was only recently that Hideyoshi started going mad with power and brought the genma back from exile to once again ravage the land. The main character is known as Soki (Oni of the Ash), who apparently has it in for Hideyoshi and wants to take him out. You also play as 4 other supporting characters who share the same sentiment: the new female Jubei Yagyu, the monk Tenkai Nankobo, the muscular priest Roberto Frois, and Soki's love interest Ohatsu. Exactly who all these new characters are and how they seemingly possess some sort of power relating to the Oni you'll have to find out for yourselves, but rest assured the connections they all have to certain legendary characters from the previous games will blow you away... or at least slightly impress you. Like I pointed out earlier, the RPG elements in this game go far beyond what they were in the first three in terms of leveling up your characters. For one thing, the characters ACTUALLY level up and this affects their melee attacks, magic attacks, weapons, and armor like in the first games, but to a greater degree. For example, you can equip items like rings and necklaces (you don't actually see them on your characters) to give your characters added benefits to defense, offense, and magic. They could also slowly replenish your health and magic over time. Soki is the character you start every level as, but you normally have one of the other characters to accompany you, and you usually (but not always) get to choose which one fights alongside you. Allies can be switched at save points and you can switch between Soki and his ally during combat with the push of a button. The D-Pad lets you issue one of four commands to your allies: stay put/block (which restores up to half of the ally's health), attack, go all-out (which increases rate of attack and decreases health) and special skill (varies with each character). Movement is now done solely through the analog stick, which is fine in this game since the camera is no longer in a fixed position and can be rotated by the player.Since this game is split into episodic chapters, you'll spend lots of time between missions in hub-like hideouts where Soki can get to know his allies through optional dialogue which is displayed in text and actually makes for some entertaining reading for these moments of downtime. While in the hideouts you can also customize your characters and even revisit previous levels with different characters so you can reach certain areas that Soki cannot normally access on his own. Now for the game's combat: the basic elements are mostly unchanged, but the new added techniques and attacks you acquire as your characters level up keep the combat from getting stale and make better use of more numerous button combinations. The characters' fighting styles also differ greatly from one another in a similar manner to Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. Soki is a balanced character who wields large swords, Jubei is speedy and wields smaller blades, Tenkai wields spears and staves that give him a longer reach, Roberto uses gauntlets that let him attack with close-range punches and jabs, and Ohatsu uses a variety of short-range and long-range firearms. They can all perform their own Oni awakenings as well, where they all become invulnerable and perform their own styles of powerful attacks (Soki is the only one who physically transforms into an Oni). Old and new genma enemies and bosses offer a decent (and at times unfair) challenge. The music has changed since the previous games as well, but fortunately the themes are mostly catchy and fit the overall tone of the levels and enemies. There are now less orchestral scores and many more pop, rock, and what sound like dance themes. There's even one theme that sounds like it's from Pirates of the Caribbean. As good as this game is, it does have a small number of noticeable issues. The cutscenes look good, but are bit on the grainy side in terms of resolution (except the CGI scenes, they're beautiful). The dialogue is unusually hammy at times, even for a Capcom game. When a cutscene occurs while the characters are in the hideouts, the in-game animations make their body movements and mannerisms appear greatly exaggerated and twitchy to the point where they appear like strung up marionettes being controlled by drunken puppet masters. Their mouths don't even move in these scenes, which is unacceptable to me in a PS2 game. Final complaint goes to the boss battles. Some are reasonably challenging, but others are unreasonably brutal, especially the last three bosses. Whether they're easy or hard, all the boss battles are long and drawn out since they all possess health bars longer than the 7 mile bridge. Even some regular enemies have this same annoyance. Despite these meager faults, this game is a lot of fun. With its emphasis on character customization and level exploration, this game lasts easily twice as long as the 3rd game, running between 20 to 30 hours (assuming you go through all the levels of the dark realm, which I could never do). Fans of Onimusha MUST get this game and hack'n slash fans should at least give it a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2010"}

In it, players will be able to travel in the wake of the Fellowship with a unique structure that allows them to explore their own path while periodically intersecting with the major events of the films. Encounter the demonic Balrog in the mines of Moria, defend the fallen city of Osgiliath, or try to destroy Helm's Deep -- the choice is yours. Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.","reviewerName":"Ryan Pritchard \"thor_oakenfelder\"","summary":"Not sure what I wanted, not sure what I got","reviewText":"I wanted a good role playing game, but I know that most movie properties are terrible games, so I didn't expect much. EA games may put out really great sports games, and the Sims, but from what I understand most of their other games aren't so hot.I bought this game on a whim, it was there, I wanted a new game, voila. I'm somewhat pleased with my decision to do this.First of all, the game looks good. It's not great, it's no Square game, but it looks good. The character images on screen constantly chage with what you equip them with, that's cool.Gameplay is fairly easy. I don't think I used any of the items in the first chapter. As soon as you realize that your characters heal when they gain a level or you save, you've got the basics for how to avoid using your items.I hated the fact that like every 10 minutes of gameplay there's a cut scene from the movie. It got to the point where they were reusing imagery from a previous cutscene, and Gandalf's voice over was repetitive. There's a save point before almost every new threat in the game, so it sometimes feels like there's too many. But don't get used to that because there are occasional long stretches without.Evil mode is something interesting. Once you complete a chapter, you can go back and play as Orcs and such and kill the characters you've been using over and over again to gain items that you may then use in your saved game.The Balrog was incredibly tough, completely out of proportion to every other threat for several chapters around it, and the amount of exp you gain is disproportionately low for how difficult he is.EA put together a fairly amusing game, but I can't help but compare it to the FF series, by which it pales in comparison. Star Wars KotOR 1 may have been a touch better, but not much.I think that if they would've done a better job with character modeling, w/ more realistic (less stiff) clothing movement, and had less than 109 movie cut scenes, with a few enhancements to the game itself, it would've been pretty good. As it is, it's fun but no great need to own it for hard core RPG fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"Antonio D. Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Not Perfect, but Definitely the Future","reviewText":"Nintendo has become \"The Company That Tries\" over the last decade. They created motion controls well before Microsoft and Sony jumped on board. And now they're revolutionizing 3D imaging with the 3DS. I was excited to see where they could go with this, and while it's not perfect, the 3DS is clearly the future of handhelds. Hell, the 3DS may be the machine that spurs on other forms of entertainment. I know I wouldn't have bought the 3DS if I had had to wear those silly glasses that come with 3D movies and TVs....The 3D is cool. Really cool, in fact. The pre-loaded game Face Raiders is more than enough to show what the system is capable of. The game itself uses whatever shoes up on the camera as the background, and slowly breaks it away while you have to shoot 3D images of your face (or a friends face) as they fly at you from all directions. The other game AR Cards, is a little clunky as it requires you keep the camera always pointed in the same direction to play, but it's still a fine example of what 3D can do. And what's best, above all else, is that all you have to do to turn the 3D off or on is pushed a tiny button up or down, even during play....That being said, it's not entirely perfect. I kind of wish the screen was the same size as the DSi XL. The smaller screen kind of makes the 3D harder to tolerate over longer play times. The buttons, too, aren't as comfortable as they could be. First, the Left and Right triggers are small and placed very close to the edges of the system. And the D-Pad is tight and place a tiny bit low. The new analog stick is nice but it feels kind of high. Obviously, they're trying to keep the system small, but if you've got big hands this system can get uncomfortable because of the awkward button placement.The accessories are also pretty cool. Being to take 3D pics of your surroundings seems underwhelming (since all we have to do is look up from the screen at whatever it is we are taking a picture of) but it really is a neat feature. It's not overwhelming but still neat. I didn't play much with the 3DS Sound (beyond blowing fart noises into it) but what little I did it has a little potential to make some incredible stuff. Then there is the Activity Log, which includes the pedometer. It keeps a daily log on the steps you take on a daily basis. This brings me to my last point: just walking with the 3DS in your pocket adds to the game. You get coins which can be used in games to buy features and other such bonus items.All in all, the 3DS is a pretty phenomenal system considering it's the first of it's kind. Is it worth buying if you got a DS already? Honestly that's a question for the individual. If you enjoy 3D movies then yes, get this. If 3D gives you headaches this will have your head pounding in no time. Plus, as of the release of this system, there really aren't many good games that support the system (Street Fighter and Star Wars are probably the two best) right now, so waiting probably would be a bad idea if you're unsure of whether or not to pick this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

I have these headphones for a year and have been very satisfied with them.  When I saw that Sony had a new set of wireless headphones (the Gold) I was curious about how they stacked up.  I was surprised that they listed less expensive than the Pulse Elite, so I did some research and found a lot of people complaining about the Pulse Elite headphones breaking.  I was thinking \"what is wrong with these users.....they must be hard on a product.....I use mine all the time and treat them carefully and they are in great shape\".  So I looked at mine, which have never been used by anyone but me, to see what part could actually be breaking only to find out that mine are breaking on both sides.  I hadn't even noticed it and don't know when I would have.  I guess I would have found out when they broke altogether.  So now I am handling them even more carefully and don't know how much longer they will be usable.So why one star.  Because this is obviously a design flaw and based on other comments, Sony has no plan to do anything about it.Someone messed up and Sony should own up and give us credit towards the new ones (which many people have said are not as good, but I will bet they don't break!).  Or maybe fix the old ones for us with a material that will withstand normal careful use for more than a year (much shorter for many other users as I have read).  It will be really disturbing for me when mine become unusable even though the electronics are still working perfectly.  When did the consumer become responsible for purchasing something in good faith that has a horrible design flaw?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

You do need a very good video card to max out game settings, so if you have an older card, don't start by maxing out the video settings or the game will most likely stutter.Having said this, the graphics for this game aren't as advanced, and don't stand out as much as some of the other game that were released at around the same time.But you didn't buy this game for the pretty graphics. You bought this game for the insane weapons and the outrageous missions.

It's not a game I would recommend for impressionable kids, or even impressionable young adults.

Thankfully Saint's Row: The Third does and man is it crazy. Parachuting out of planes, shooting tanks while falling out of the sky, God of War style boss fights in virtual reality, beating people up with giant purple dildos? Yeah, I'd say that's crazy, but The Third offers even more!The story is really great with awesome characters and witty dialog. Johnny Gat dies in the beginning mission (that's no spoiler), but returning characters like Pierce and Shaundi return, and the new characters are just as great such as the bit brute Oleg and the nerd Kenzie. This time around you are famous and the Saint's own the city, but they lose it because three new gangs move into town: The Morningstar, Deckers, and Luchadores. A para-military group STAG has also moved in with heavily armored guys, tanks, and VTOL's (jets) that, yes you can fly and keep in your garage.A lot of the story missions are interesting and completely varied to help deliver this interesting and entertaining story. From going inside a super computer and fighting as a walking toilet, blow-up doll, or fighting in a Luchadore match, and shooting cars with a rocket launcher from a helicopter, to just running around and killing everything is a huge blast and each mission is different. Of course there are side missions such as Trailblazing where you drive around in a fireproof suit on an ATV and run into people and cars to blow them up to earn seconds on a clock as you blow through a checkpoint race. There are other side missions that let you pimp your girls around, Insurance Fraud lets you get hit by cars to earn money, Mayhem lets you use pre-determined weapons to cause as much destruction as possible and a lot more. My favorite are the Genki matches which is like a gladiator type game show. There is no shortage of things to do in The Third with collectibles to be found, assassination missions, car theft missions, and tons of challenges.Saint's Row doesn't stop there with a ton of cars to drive as well as a bunch of customization options for building your character, upgrading and decking out cars, to a crap ton of upgrades, for you and your guns even. You can use your phone to call in homies to help you fight, deliver vehicles, and even customize how your gang looks and taunts. You can run around and buy property to increase your respect rating and how much control you have over that territory.But what about the world you play in you say? It looks amazing with DirectX 11 features exclusive to PC which makes the game look ten times better than that of the consoles and the world is huge and bursting at the seams with life. The game never looks boring, feels boring, or sounds boring with great radio stations with funny commercials, and even one radio station dedicated to Adult Swim. I just can't describe how crazy this game is because you have to play it to experience it. The controls are silky smooth with great car control, and even aircraft control nicely. Is there anything wrong with the game? Yeah there are some irritating issues like ragdoll physics when you get blown up, there are way too many enemies to kill, and the side missions are extremely difficult, but these things can be easily overlooked. If you love open world games I would say Saint's Row: The Third is the best out there and there really isn't anything quite like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

It's a lot of fun at first, but it's really easy to get bored with it. The action is lightning quick, the visuals are cinematic, the graphics are very nice although they over used the blinn and anistropic shaders a bit. (Gives things a kind of shiny plastic look.) It's pretty non-stop action from the get go.Unfortunately the story is laughable at best. The enemies are a bit far fetched and repetetive, i.e. ninja dogs. Yes, they're dogs that have little doggy pants that hold shurikens. They grab the throwning knives with their mouths and throw them at you with surprising accuracy. Who comes up with this?While we're on the topic of obsurdity... Your CIA co-star has breasts so big they could make a pornstar blush, not to mention she's dressed more for a fetish club than a covert mission.

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"Fun game but several things wrong w/ it..","reviewText":"Set in a beautiful warm vacation island, it's just too bad most of the locals want to kill you. FC3 was a fun and addicting game to play but there were too many things wrong w/ it that unfortunately overshadowed my fun w/ it.I'll start out w/ what I didn't like about it. First, the story, personally I didn't like the story, the antagonist was really good, he was definitely the definition of insanity, voiced really well and just a really good character you cared about, but that's about all I liked about the story. I found myself kind of avoiding the story in favor of taking over outposts which was the most fun part of the game, and I would've much rather not played a couple of the latter levels as I found them un-enjoyable and frustrating, there were also several plot holes (I wish I could explain more, but, spoilers..), overall, I thought the story was a bit too long. Second, the graphics, I can't believe some of the people say this game has great graphics, there was this weird black artifact that showed up on walls and on the side of world objects, and it would kind of blink when you moved, it was definitely noticeable and enough of an immersion killer for me to list as a negative in the graphics part. The jaggies were also pretty noticeable and there were also objects that stuck through walls as well as objects that were floating. I do realize this was on the 360, but I know what the 360 is capable of and I thought an older game, Skyrim, looked better than this did. This is not to say that the graphics overall were bad, it was nice to see sun rays coming down and the underwater visuals looked really nice as well. Third, the AI, the AI in this game is terrible, from watching a guy run himself over with his Own car to watching a guy run into a wall repeatedly, the AI is pretty bad, and after a while I found myself taking advantage of the AI in outposts which hurts the immersion in the game. Fourth, somewhat of a minor annoyance in the game, I thought that being able to hide bodies should have been a game mechanic from the beginning, but instead you have to acquire it as a skill, and not only that but it's not perfectly implemented, you can easily drop a body by looking around or even turning too much. Lastly, I didn't like how you were forced to use stealth to get the full experience points from taking over outposts, it was way more fun going guns blazing, blowing stuff up, and then dealing w/ the reinforcements. So what ends up happening if you don't go stealth on enough outposts you won't get enough experience points to put into skills so you won't have as much fun as if you did unlock everything. If they do FC4 I'd like to see them change this somehow so you are able to get full experience points no matter how you play.Now for the positives, the characters you meet are really good, the antagonist, Vaas, is really good, he is definitely the definition of insanity, and Citra, your ally, was really good as well, Jason Brody, the character you play was pretty good, though I didn't like him too much, I just thought he didn't change and grow as well as I'd like. The part that I found most fun about this game was taking over outposts, stealth was challenging but fun, sniping from afar, waiting for the right moment to strike, sneaking around and assassinating someone then dragging and hiding the body, then finally getting the full experience points from not having anyone notice you. I also loved the skills, each skill definitely made an impact, and once you had acquired a good amount of skills or maxed out everything, you felt like Rambo going through the jungle infiltrating outposts using cool moves, like \"death from below\", which allowed you to assassinate someone from underwater and take their body underwater and kill them.Overall, I recommend Far Cry 3 to play as it is a fun game to play for the most part and it gets addicting taking over outposts, leveling up, and acquiring and using skills, but the parts of this game I didn't like overshadowed the positives too much for me to say this was a good game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action.

Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"Ashern \"Hmmm\"","summary":"A game I thoroughly enjoyed!","reviewText":"I originally ordered this to go alongside another game that had my primary interest upon ordering. I didn't expect much from this, but I did always wonder what this game was like. I was very disappointed at the other game I had bought with it, and it turns out I was equally as joyous that I purchased Max Payne 3!At the time I first played it, I had only ever played Max Payne 1 (which I had forgotten deeply). I was worried that there would be too much focus on past events that would cause me to lose connection to the current one. Luckily, that was not the case. They do mention names and events from Max's past, but rest assured that for new players it's easily just a case of \"I wonder what happened back then,\" and for returning players to the series, it's simply nostalgia. If this is the first time you're hearing about Max Payne, choosing to play the 1st or 3rd one first has no impact on the game, nor the series.This game features a bit of a heavy focus on Max Payne's narration throughout the game, just like the last two games. For some, this can be annoying, but for me, I enjoyed it. Why? Well, for starters, the story and character development are superb! It's in such a way that you actually *want* to know what Max is thinking.Max Payne 3 is quite linear, as has always been the nature, so don't expect to roam around and find hidden buildings. With that said, I would prefer it be linear in this sense. I started the game and was immediately connected, and wanted to stay connected until the end (and then some). This game did a fine job at doing that. It also has a high amount of re-playability even after you complete it.You *will* die a lot in this game, granted you die a lot less as you get better at playing. Something I love about this game is the \"cool factor\" it has. You can press one button and go into Bullet Time (slow-motion) to aim precisely, or to just get out of a tough situation (since you can't get killed while you're in a Bullet Time dive). The controls are responsive for the most part, but you may die from abnormal movements. Though, like I said above, the more you get used to these abnormal movements, the less you die from them.Almost whenever you pick up \"Painkillers\" (used to heal yourself), Max will say a line, almost as if letting the player know why he picked it up. It was nice seeing what he'd say the next time. Also, if you take a fatal bullet while you're carrying a Painkiller, instead of dying right away, you'll slowly start falling to the ground; at which point you gain the ability to kill the person that shot you. If you kill him, you won't die, and will instead fall to the ground and get back up.For multiplayer, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I didn't play it for a while because I didn't really want to join the multiplayer of a game I didn't know. Hence, I played Single Player for a good long while. When I first started playing the multiplayer, it was confusing in the beginning, but I slowly got the hang of it. It requires you to be quick with your on-screen reflexes (and a decent internet connection can play a heavy part in it as well). If you have neither of the above, then your experience may differ. There are, however, some annoyances within Multiplayer; such as a particular pistol being more accurate than generally any rifle could hope to be, and being just as strong as well. It doesn't cause other weapons to be useless, but it does cause the pistol to be favored more than any other gun, especially with how light it is.You can choose between Faction characters or characters from the story mode to play as, including Max. (There is also DLC available that adds additional Faction characters as well as previous characters from the earlier Max Payne entries.) Faction characters are basically the simple enemies you kill in story mode, the \"bad guys.\" It has an average character customization for those Faction characters -- nothing too in-depth, but you can make a character \"yours\" easily enough with a higher rank to unlock more customization options. The ranking system also includes a \"Prestige\"-like mode, allowing you to reset all your earnings once you get to max rank, and then start all over with a new Prestige rank icon.I didn't buy this game for multiplayer (and I probably wouldn't), but it's a nice addition. One thing to note, is that now, the servers aren't loaded with people; meaning that it won't be a plethora of matches to find in the Matchmaking. At times, it can go a while without finding a game. Sadly, this is amplified with DLC maps since not everyone buys them. But that's mainly at the dead hours. There are still people playing and enjoying the multiplayer, though it's just not what it used to be.The heart of this game resides within the Single player mode, and what a great heart it is. I feel for Max as he goes through the game. The story that the developers try to present is presented well, and there is never a feeling of a rushed scene or a \"downgrade\" in quality anywhere throughout the game.PROS:-Engaging storyline-Great character development (storyline-wise, not customization)-Near flawless presentation-Responsive controls for the most part, may die some times due to them, though-Decent multiplayer-A good amount of re-playabilityCONS:-Inability to skip cutscenes (the function is there, but 75% of the time, you can't skip the scene because the game is \"loading\" the next map)-Slightly unbalanced multiplayer weapons, favoring towards pistols.--The cons are in no way game-breaking, but are worth knowing. Another thing to note for returning players, is that this Max Payne does away with the comic-strip story telling, and just uses cut-scenes. Load screens are of comic-strip pictures of scenes related to that level, though.Overall, I'm very glad that I unknowingly bought the game that I consider a favorite of mine. If you've played the past two Max Payne games, or even if you haven't, you just may enjoy this a lot. If it helps any, had I known what this game was at the time of release, I would have gladly payed full price for it. It's definitely a great game at this price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

A massive universe with an in depth storyline, real and entertaining characters, engaging dialogue and sidquests, and a breadth that nothing short of incredible. Basically, something not to be missed.The graphics are gorgeous, though too much is cast in a weird orange glow that swallows almost everything. But the tech nerd will delight in the hologrpahic loading screens, of which there are about 30, the near photorealism of the characters and some long distance visuals.Audio is perfect, with a combination of old and new voices, some so apropo to character they'll make your skin crawl. Major props to Martin Sheen for the Illusive Man. There is however, a lot of overlap when too many opponents occupy the screen. Also, some voices are oddly placed and distorted, so that you'll be listening to a side conversation that seems to be happening from across the room.Gameplay is what you'd expect, but also where the most bizarre developments were made. Almost every story mission, all of which contain critical in game items and upgrades, are one play only. So if you miss something, you'll never know, much less be able to go back and get it. Planets that are explorable are now fewer and farther between, and the system to move from planet to planet, despite working well, is now a odd feeling piloting sim.Health and shields are now totally regenerative, and healing is solely for your squadmates, so there's no longer an ability to heal on the fly, making this more like Gears of War cover to cover combat. Emphasis is now on skills, many of which combine well. XP is radically changed, and no longer dependent on combat. This is rather confusing, and makes leveling hard to visualize, and what gets you experience seems random at time. Skills are also shrunk to 6, removing a fair amount of character customization.Upgrades and improvements replace the majority of new equipment, which has to be researched. Searching for resources is now a annoying mini-game that feels like one of those old school adventure games where you scoured every pixel of every screen to progress. The new hacking and decryption minigames are fairly nice, and easy to get through, meaning tech personnel are no longer mandatory.A fantastic game with only a few features that have backslid from the first chapter, this is still probably the most in-depth, expansive, and beautiful RPG you'll play this year. And I can say that despite it still being January.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Updated version (7/5/2012)","reviewText":"{updated, 200+ hours in, level 41}I have started 2 other characters, but my main guy is level 41 now. This game is simply amazing. I purchased Dawnguard and it's easily worth the 14.99 price tag. Bethesda did such a great job with the expansion because everything is so well thought out and extremely vibrant. The main quest for Dawnguard is LONG. It was estimated about 10-20 hours long; I am taking thing a little slow and I am around on my 16th hour. I might be around 75% done, so 25 hours seems like it will be around that for me. It's not like Shivering Isle for Oblivion where there is a vast landscape for you to roll around it. Dawnguard is a castle in Skyrim itself on your map. Bethesda also added tons of new caves and forts so you can accompany the main quest. This is a no spoiler review so I will just leave it at; you can either follow the main quest and be a Vampire Hunter. Or you can accept the agreement of the vampire Demon Lord and become a Demon Lord. That's not a spoiler - it was in countless interviews with Todd Howard and even in commercials. But there are other surprises along the way if you stay a Vampire hunter.As for the main game; everything is fixed. All the bugs, crashes, quest drops, etc. The game is perfect. I have most of all the locations discovered on my map and it looks awesome. Like I said, I am at level 41 with an easy 150 hours on my main character - not to mention 200+ hours in total gameplay. As for my main character, I still have plenty to do; mages quest, multiple side quest, a lot of misc quest to finish up, and to clear all of the locations I have discovered.With BF/Holidays coming, get this game, it will consume your life and there will be plenty of sales on it.{updated, 75 hours in, level 32}Game never gets old, however, I would not download the latest 1.2 patch Bethesda put out. Apparently it messed up a few things and I would just not download it and play offline. I am sure Bethesda is working on the problem.{updated, 50 hours in, level 28}This game continues to bring a fresh breath of air each and every time I play it. I have not done any guilds, have done only 1 part of the main mission (went to high harothgar to make unrelenting force more powerful), and haven't done a lot of the 'big' quest. I have concentrated on cave/ruins/fort looting with my sneak/bow master with some 'misc' quest mixed in. I have over 120 locations discovered and around 50 cleared. This game has exceeded my expectations in almost every way imaginable. For me, and in my opinion I will add, is the game of the generation and GOTY 2011.{updated, 16 hours in, level 13}This game has exceeded my expectations and I didn't even know that could happen because I set such a high bar for it. Everything in this game is smooth, no more glitches, bugs, freezes, etc. It runs so similar to fallout 3 with graphics and NPC except they are much smoother and responsive. The character animations have improved greatly, no more weird, awkward NPC talk. Skyrim is basically Fallout 3 graphics and animations but much smoother and improved, and everything great about Oblivion but much more polished out. It seems as if the Fallout 3 crowd loves it, but hated Oblivion. The magic is very smooth and amazing, however, you will need to increase your magic significantly if you want to be a pure mage... I am a hybrid because some monsters are quick and you cannot hit them with any spells. Marksman also serves a great purpose in this game. That is all, enjoy!-----------------------------------------------------All I can say is wow, I am not going to go into depth too much because this game is full of spoilers...Animations are incredible, character detail is incredible, story is incredible, NPC is absolutely better than Oblivion, lock picking is similar to Fallout 3, graphics are top notch, character leveling up is simplified and very easy to understand, and there are plenty of things to do.Story {Quests}: 9.5/10Graphics {ran in DX9, had to because of all the detail and mere size of this game}: 9/10Fun: 10/10Sounds: 10/10Longevity: 10/10Interaction: 10/10Overall: 9.6Like I said, that's about all I am going to go into it....

About halfway through, I began to wonder... what's the point of having so many different planets to explore if they all have the same buildings?The answer -- Mass Effect is really a pretty short game, artificially drawn out by the inclusion of a bunch of cookie-cutter 'missions'. Mass Effect's story is pretty interesting, and there's definitely a more pronounced element of 'character development' than in most other console games, but still... it didn't really do it for me.You are mildly motivated to grind XP and money, as those unlock new skills and items... but really, there's no need, since other enemies level up right along with you. You can rush through the game and do fine. The game is designed to appeal to habitual XP / Gold 'grinders' and loses a bit of its appeal once you realize it (just like when you realize that most subscription-based MMORPGs are designed to be addictive and impossible to 'beat').Mass Effect is entertaining, fun, and definitely a pretty game. The storyline is pretty compelling and you can genuinely get to know and feel for the characters. Still, it's oversimplified, repetitive, and doesn't stand out among the hordes of other similar games out there. 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Having multiple choices for dialogue response isn't novel today, but it's still an interesting experience to see the results of your choices.This game is a third-person-shooter. You'll almost always have two squadmates with you wherever you go. They can typically hold their own without any help, but the game always pauses for you if you decide to pick orders for them, although they can't always do precisely what you want. You cannot issue individual orders, which would have been pretty helpful.I actually felt the central story missions together were rather short. Take some time to do side missions for more money and experience points. A lot of them involve landing on barren planets with the Mako vehicle. Unfortunately, controlling the Mako can sometimes be cumbersome, and a lot of the planets feel a little too similar.I wouldn't worry about the romance subplot (I barely noticed it); this game's M-rated for good reasons, but the culminating love scene is short and tame compared to those in some Hollywood movies.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

The hook in Sonic Advance 3 is that you can play as any two of the five heroes (Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, and Cream) at the same time with a friend controlling the second character on a second GBA. The catch is that in single-player mode, you can't switch to the secondary hero; they're mostly just there for backup and show, and to help you perform special combo moves unique to each duo. The way you progress through levels has also changed a bit as well. Rather than simply moving from act to act in a linear fashion, the game now features a \"hub\" world that connects each stage's three acts and boss level. Hub worlds also contain mini-games-if you can find them-that earn you bonuses like extra lives. But despite these changes, the basic Sonic 2D building blocks-the straightforward \"go right and go right fast!\" gameplay-are still the foundation, and the tendency toward repetition (it's all springboards, loops, and grind-rails in Sonictown) won't win any new fans for the franchise. Aside from some garish tunes in the Toy Kingdom, the game sounds and looks great, and the use of color and character animation is a step above even the already sharp-looking Sonic Advance 2, but the series is definitely losing momentum. The hedgehog species is heavy on attitude but has a hard time with evolution.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2004"}

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Christopher Manna","summary":"Pikmin Review","reviewText":"Pikmin is a game that is mostly organizing and strategy.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Holds up well","reviewText":"I never played any of the GTA games until about a month and a half ago. (Well, aside from a few hours right after GTA3 was released; see my recent review.) Just recently, I started GTA3 around the end of May, completed it and moved on to Vice City, completed it... and now I'm about to complete San Andreas. Each one of them took almost exactly two weeks to finish, basically just plowing through the missions and not spending a lot of time just screwing around (which I'll probably do later, after I recover from the inevitable burnout this sort of franchise marathon entails.)I'm not exactly kicking myself for not playing them sooner, because as far as I'm concerned my reasons for not playing them were sound. But I am really glad that I've finally experienced them and can appreciate them now, years after the fact. Obviously these games are dated, but I think they hold up quite well. In many ways I think they are far better at giving a true \"role playing\" experience than most so called RPGs. The GTA games really do give you a huge virtual world to live in, and San Andreas in particular gives you a nice set of variables (e.g. weapon skill level, vehicle skill level, clothing, hair styles, body type [which is actually dependent on food intake + exercise, holy moly]) to fiddle with and truly create your own unique avatar, along with a XXXL size virtual world compared to the previous games. One thing I found surprising was the level of humor. They aren't slapstick comedy or anything, but I always assumed they were pretty straight-faced crime dramas. They actually get pretty goofy at times.If this game has a flaw, it's that it's simply too big. You're free to ignore all of the extraneous side activities if you want to, though if you do you'll miss out on their benefits. And as cool as it is to inhabit this huge virtual world, the other side of the coin is that you spend a lot of time driving through rural areas between cities. When you're on your fifth or sixth marathon trek with nothing to do except drive, it might start to wear on your nerves. Still, I appreciate the designers' intent. If nothing else, I can at least say there has never been a video game that got on my nerves in this way. All in all, I preferred the more tightly focused GTA III and Vice City. Bigger is not always better.If you're like me and have ignored GTA all these years because they just didn't seem interesting or fun, I strongly urge you to take a chance and find out just how wrong you were.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2011"}

It is innovative, intuitive, and most of all, fun.  Gamers and non-gamers alike will be able to pick this game up and start playing within seconds.First off, I'll get the bad news out of the way.  Graphically this game isn't going to wow anyone.  The graphics are adequate and never go beyond that.  The sound and music is instantly forgettable.  The characters are saccharine cute, uninspired and half of them make weird grunting noises like a puppy with a bad case of painful gas.  Hardcore gamers will likely dismiss this game as a throw-away cutsie/kiddie title.  I wouldn't blame them, but that would be their loss.  On a side note, if you're a fan of Happy Tree Friends, the characters bear a striking resemblance... except they are block-shaped.The good news is that just about everything else in this game is very well designed and fun.  To truly grasp how the gameplay works you have to see it in action, but I'll try to describe it as best I can.  The premise of this physics-based puzzle game is that each level will have a challenge, such as destroy every gem block or carefully unstack a pile of rectangular blocks much like you would as if you were playing Jenga.  Some levels will have you throwing tennis balls, bombs, or bowling balls at to interact with the level while others may have you spraying fire hoses and blasting things with lasers.  Some levels  encourage you to operate with delicate precision and others encourage reckless, destructive behavior.  Overall, the game has a good balance.  The gameplay is varied and the use of the Wii controls is very impressive (with one minor exception being the light-gun style mini-games which are very rare).  This game really could have been terrible.  Too many developers would have slapped some half-baked control scheme onto this game and called it good, but this is one of those rare games where the developer obviously put a lot of thought into the control.I haven't played multi-player very much, but what I've played is very fun and enjoyable.  Single player is addictive, so much so that I was late to a dinner meeting because my friends kept urging me to check out the next level.  Most of the levels are clever and leave the player with a great sense of accomplishment when completed.  After every five or six levels a new feature or function is opened up, which keeps the gameplay from getting stale.  From what I can tell there are hundreds of levels built into the game PLUS the game includes a full featured level editor allows you to modify existing levels and create your own in addition to being able to share your creations with others on the internet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2008"}

As heroes, they explore familiar battlefields, discover new lands, and take on epic quests and challenges in Blizzard's massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Blizzard has taken care to make the game accessible and fun both for hard-core 60-hour-a-week players and for more casual adventurers.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Finally a MMO for hard core and casual players","reviewText":"As far as my background to this game type, I am relatively new to the MMORPG genre.  I've played Shadowbane, Lineage II (briefly), spent a good deal of time with Final Fantasy XI, and beta tested Matrix Online.  As far as this game goes, I've been playing since Beta and am currently a lvl 58 Priest (among other characters).  So, onto the review:MMORPGs are a funny beast.  On one level all they are is a hack and slash game where the point is to kill monsters to get xp to get levels to get better equipment/skills to kill more monsters to get more xp to...you get the picture.  And yet, for some magical reason there is this addiction that pushes people forward when the truth of the matter is that there really is \"no point.\"  Some MMORPGs are better than others.  World of Warcraft is one of these.WoW appeals to a very broad group of people, both hard core and casual players.  It's a game where I can pick it up and spend maybe 30 mins to an hour and actually feel like I've accomplished something.  Or, I can spend 5 hours crawling through one of the many instanced dungeons without so much as a bathroom break.  Part of the reason I've stayed with WoW (and will continue to stay) is the quest system.  Most of the quests have good rewards and good xp and really give you a purpose for your action.  Instead of \"I'm going to kill creature X for the first 10 levels, then move to creature Y\" it becomes, I'm going to quest in Duskwood and help clean out their undead problems.  You see Morbent Fel has been a pest for sometime now and someone needs to put him out of his misery.  It's things like that, that keep me wanting to play.Not to say that quests don't give a load of problems in themselves.  The most general quests you have to deal with are \"kill 10 of these, 5 of those and their leader\" or \"collect 20 pig intestines\" or \"I'm lazy, deliver this for me, will you?\" And after killing your 100th pig for their intestines, you start wondering why you can't just cut it out of them when they are dead because surely every pig has an intestine.  So, there are small problems like these with quests and there are some quest drops that could stand a more frequent drop.  But, if there weren't any quests, you would still be killing the 100 pigs for xp.One of the big reasons WoW is a killer of my time is that Blizzard seemed to take almost everything that wasn't fun with an MMORPG and do away with it.  Because the dungeons are instanced, you aren't usually competing with a ton of campers over that rare Sword of Ogre slaying +9.  Each race has a specific mount that makes traveling quicker.  Most of the main areas you will be adventuring in have flight paths that help cut down travel time.  Unlike some games (FFXI I'm looking at you!) you don't NEED to have a group.  Most of the time, I have been able to solo my way through most quests (as a Priest no less).  Now, for dungeons or bigger quests a group is still a necessity.  But there's usually something to do if you can't find a group.Graphic wise, the game is not exactly packing the polygons.  the trees's leaves are flat and look like a pop up book in some ways.  But, the art direction is absolutely amazing.  I don't even think about the trees etc (unless I'm flying above them, that's when it's most noticeable) because it is just so well done.  And each area looks different from others.  It's just really well done.There are some problem areas right now.  Most people who play the game will complain about the lag and about how many stability issues have been cropping up since release date.  I'm not supporting Blizzard, but I can understand some of these problems.  WoW is the biggest selling MMORPG in a short time.  Blizzard wasn't expecting that big of a number in such a short time.  Retail stores couldn't keep the game on the shelf.  Because of this, the realms weren't made to support so many so soon.  However, Blizzard has done, in my opinion, an admirable job in keeping in touch with the problems through their website and have given out many free days because of lag/log on issues.Also, it's very easy to progress to the current level cap of 60.  Normally when games do this, it is to facilitate the true focus of PvP.  Right now, PvP is basically a high level character or groups of characters murdering characters 20+ levels below them.  Not exactly a fair system right now for some.  But, there are some improvements in the close future such as Battlegrounds, a PvP arena that has bonuses and quests and PvP.  Hopefully, Blizzard continues to innovate with these trends.Finally, the biggest problem with having a game that caters to a wide audience is the fact that a lot of ignorant, bigotted and basically disreputable people plague the general chat with inane and downright mean things.  I can't count how many times someone asks a question and gets beat down for asking it.  Or how many times the word f*g was used or other demeaning words.  It's almost an epidemic.  There's free speech then there's what goes on in the general chat.  If it weren't for the fact that I use general chat to find groups or help others out, I would get rid of the channel.  As it is, my ignore list is growing steadily.  I never had to deal with that in FFXI or Shadowbane and it's a shame that these people are hurting people's WoW experience.I've said alot about this game and I think it's a testament to the quality of this game when I have a queue of about 5 console games that I haven't played or finished because I've spent most of my gaming time with WoW.  Problems aside, it is a really good MMORPG that caters to a wide range of players.  It's a game that, if Blizzard continues to roll out great content, I could see myself playing for a long time into the future.  They have already added enough new content to the game to take up an expansion pack.  If they are giving this much free content, one eagerly wonders what an expansion pack would do.  Keep an eye on this one, it's touching greatness.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2005"}

Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"For the Tolkien Fans - Should You Buy This Game...?","reviewText":"I have only spent some 24 hours with this remarkable game, and already I am deeply impressed. I am not writing a full review just now so much as I'm giving some first impressions of the gaming experience.I am a Tolkien zealot, let me mention this immediately. I'm the guy who loves the movie but says &quot;That's not how it happened in the books...&quot; every 10 seconds. My diehard fanboy status cannot be questioned. However, I'm also an avid gamer. When I heard The Lord of the Rings was getting a video game treatment (or two, rather), I was initially cynical. Yet, in the end, my curiosity overcame me, and I picked up the PS2 version of this game and gave it a go. I was IMMEDIATELY impressed with the opening sequence. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;maybe this won't be so bad after all.&quot; That is a bit of an understatement.My first trek through Bag End and Hobbiton was a splendid experience. I was IN my favorite book, after a fashion. Playing on, things only got better. Hiding from a Black Rider in a rotten log on the side of a road should be one of the highlights in gaming this year. The light-swallowing Nazgul knows you are near, and silently seeks for you, and all you can hear are the nighbirds in the distance. Then, you throw a rock to distract the Rider, and take off on foot as fast as your hairy feet can carry you. Bravo! This moment alone was worth the price of admission, I kid you not.However, if you're such a purist that you can't stand the thought of giant spiders in the Old Forest, or wargs roaming the Shire before Frodo begins his journey, then you had probably better not buy this game. I pity you, though. I AM a purist, and I am in love with this playable adaptation of my beloved classic. I may cringe at the OCCASIONAL inaccuracy, but it's not near enough to keep me away.So, as a Tolkien zealot, is this game for you? I'd say yes. Definitely. Oh yeah. This is pretty much as faithful to the books as a game can be... I love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2002"}

They just can't do it. Nor can they get people to care about their stupid stories that do nothing but interrupt the whole point of GTA: Cause havoc. Instead, starting with the most insulting bang that was GTA IV (because what the GTA really needed was mandatory darts and hanging out with idiot characters who aren't at all likable, not that silly \"sandbox\" idea of doing whatever you want, when you want, and how you want), they continue to make very slight changes to a formula that they're actively ruining with each new release. Somehow, for some reason, they still sink money into everything we couldn't care less about, especially story.If you play GTA for the story, you need to see a doctor. Games with stories are out there, and they don't stifle all the action like GTA loves to do, which completely dropped the ball when it came to focusing on its roots, instead turning it into a linear RPG with typical under-par Rockstar writing.Not quite as insulting as the disaster that was IV, which was, without the possibility of debate except by total lunatics who have no idea what they're talking about, a massive step down from San Andreas in every single way besides scenery.The GTA series is a lot like Madden. Minor changes not necessarily for the better or worse, just changes made because they need to put new features on the product, while deliberately avoiding making the game \"perfect\", because they know people will buy this garbage, anyway.At least Vice City is $4.99 on Android. It's hard to beat that, especially since it's a superior game to IV and now V. Awful. Anyone still following this series really need to stop Rockstar from not needing to care. Let's face it, they're a bad developer. They ruin game after game because they can't make quality. They can't get it right, anywhere.Of course, they don't need to get it right, because people see a new Roman numeral next to \"Grand Theft Auto\", and that's the only selling point they need to keep players playing bad games. It works, apparently, so keep it up, Rockstar. You're doing great to fool people who have no pattern recognition, just like Madden fans and anyone who, understandably, was disappointed that Starcraft 2 was simply not as good as the original. If the formula is a money-maker, why change it?If you said something along the lines of, \"Because...uh, it's GTA!\" That's exactly right.More trash from Rockstar. Wonderful. Just, stay away, because they're still one of the most over-hyped developers of all time next to Capcom. Bravo for the money you make, Rockstar--even if you don't know how to develop a proper game, at least you can sell with the best of them. And that's all that really matters to any company on the planet that survives for more than a few months.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Superior action, but less horror, than its predecessor","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 picks up right where 2008's masterful game Dead Space left off. Issac Clark wakes up in a colony known as The Sprawl, and has to battle not only new legions of necromorphs, but also a unknown agency after him for unknown reasons, as well as his own sanity.Dead Space 2 feels very much like its predecessor with a few changes. The game looks significantly better than the first game did (which also still looks very good for a nearly 5 year old game). The developers have also made a couple of improvements in the gameplay that definitely work for the better. Telekinesis is now much easier and more intuitive to use. The zero gravity environments are also much more enjoyable now with boosters attached to Issac's suit, giving him much more mobility and freedom, not to mention some incredible new scenarios and set pieces. Also, the inclusion of some new weapons was nice, although its usually the tried and true favorites from the first game that seem to be the most effective.The major change in Dead Space 2 is a much stronger focus on action. While the game does have lots of creepy and tense moments, there isn't nearly as much mystery, which inevitably leads to a much less scary game that Dead Space was. Issac also shows his face, and speaks quite a bit in this game, witty one-liners and all. The Sprawl isn't nearly as scary as the Ishimura was, with its creaking metal and narrow corridors. In fact, while the environment led to so much of the scares in Dead Space, Dead Space 2 seems to rely more on jump-scare tactics that sometimes feel cheap, almost like the developers knew their formula didn't have much new to it. Overall, the gameplay improvements make Dead Space 2 a really good action game, but that special blend of intense horror that was present in the first game seems to be lost. This is still a very good game, but I hope that they don't continue in this less horror/more action direction in the future.Something else very much worth mentioning is the inclusion of the rail shooter Dead Space: Extraction, which comes with PS3 versions of Dead Space 2. Dead Space: Extraction serves as a prequel to the original Dead Space. The game was released on the Nintendo Wii, and is included here in version that has been updated with HD graphics and optimized for Playstation Move motion controllers. This is a very enjoyable rail shooter that fills in lots of the backstory of Dead Space, and is a very strong game in itself. Obviously, being a rail shooter, it's not as scary as the games where you have complete control of your character, but it's a very fun game nonetheless that looks great on PS3 and works incredibly well with the Move. If you have options, the PS3 version of Dead Space 2 is worth it simply for the inclusion of this very good game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2012"}

From 1985, it has appeared on almost every Nintendo console released to the world and continues to evolve in terms of style, art direction, storyline and game play. While you can play the very first installment in this great series on the Wii via the Virtual Console service, most people who had the NES experienced it right here.You take control of Samus Aran, a female bounty hunter, who travels throughout space to help maintain order between the planets. Your mission wass to find and destroy Mother Brain, an evil entity out to take over the world with her army of various aliens. Back in 1985, this game blew the doors of what a contemporary game should be. Much like Super Mario Bros. set the standards for the once popular but now almost non-existent platform game, Metroid set the standards for the adventure genre with its branching paths to different worlds, various power suits and weapons. Without a map to rely on, you basically had to use your memory to find your way around the game. As you acquire these suits and weapons, you become stronger and can access certain rooms and gain entry to certain areas. Some of these are out in the open while others are concealed within the walls themselves so prepare to shoot your weapon everywhere. You eventually get to the last world where Mother Brain resides and fight it out until she's defeated.Just about everything about the game was and still is solid. The graphics, while primitive compared to today's standards, was top of the line as it was one of the launch games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The sound effects and music captured the mood while you're playing. The controls were responsive and do exactly what you wanted. The story was pretty basic but you got over it quickly. The game was pretty long so there was a password system in place. Whenever you die, you were given a password that you can use later to continue where you left off.This game was perfect for those who played it in its original cartridge form. It had been re-released later on with a different box cover, then ported to the Game Boy Advance and was included as an unlockable extra in the Gamecube title, \"Metroid Prime.\" Go play this game if you want to relieve good memories or if you haven't played it to begin with, see how it all started. ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED******","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

There are two things that you'll need to do to run this game perfectly smoothly at 1080p/60fps/maxed settings:1. Set AA to \"FXAA;\" 2x will cut your fps in half, and 4x by 2/3rds -- if you're still under 60fps, turn AA off.2. Buy a better graphics card (and possibly CPU; I'm using a 2500k, so nothing is CPU-limited [except Crysis (because it will never use more than 36% of your quad-core CPU)]). This is a DX11 game and you'll need at least a 470/560ti/6950 to pull off 1080p/60fps/maxed smoothly (no drops)...my 560ti (at 950 Mhz) averages around 70%, and peaks near 90%, at 60fps (monitored via Afterburner on second display).To me, at maxed settings at 1080p, this game looks vastly better than any preceding FEAR title, as well it should, given that it requires nearly twice the GPU as FEAR 2...it blows it away, in my opinion. It would surprise me very much if this were simply a direct port, especially as it's running in DX11; it's very likely that the console versions look terrible, but that just isn't the case with high-end PC equipment capable of running DX11.  This is essentially next-generation in that a 560ti @ 950 has approximately 500% more power than \"Xenos\" (note that all FEAR titles on XBOX 360 run @ 720p/30fps [or less] @ DX9)...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"ellafan","summary":"Good and scary!!!","reviewText":"I'm in the middle of this game, and I can't tell you how many times I have  jumped out of my skin as a new,horrid creature suddenly looms in front of me!

I played this on my PS3 with widescreen and progressive scan on, and the game looks as good as some of the early PS3 games.  It's really a great looking title.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that there are a few portions of this game that are extremely difficult, especially at the end.  I won't spoil anything, but there were two parts in particular that took a lot of tries to get past.  Luckily the load times are short, and the check points frequent.

{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"A fine fourth installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise","reviewText":"Developed and published by Ubisoft in 2011, Assassin's Creed: Revelations is the fourth game in the Assassin's Creed franchise.  In Revelations you reprise your role as Ezio Auditore da Firenze who has travelled to Constantinople in search of an ancient artifact which could end the war between Templars and Assassin's forever.  Revelation's story picks up right where Brotherhood left off allowing you to smoothly continue the events of the previous games.  Here are my thoughts on Assassin's Creed: Revelations;Pros+ Addictive gameplay makes you want to achieve 100% synchronization.+ Fantastic story that ties up a lot of loose ends in the series.+ Unique and rewarding multiplayer mode.+ Missions were more varied than in previous releases.+ Cappadocia was beautifully designed even if it was small.+ Freeroaming gameplay was fun as always.+ Phenomenal graphics.+ Interesting and challenging puzzles to solve.+ Fast-paced combat.+ Flashbacks were great and provided you with the ability to play as both Altair and Ezio.+ Great variety of weapons and tools to use.  I especially liked the additions of the parachuteand climbing/sliding hook.+ Bomb crafting was a new and unique addition to the game.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Certain game features felt more tacked on than fully fleshed out.  Examples include the Tower Defense of dens. Its quirky camera made it troublesome to place your assassin's.  Another example included the conquest of the Mediterranean cities.  It just felt like too much micro managing.  Certain cities also seemed to lose assassin's influence more quickly than others.  Also, some times the missions didn't reward influence.  Both the Tower Defense and Conquest felt a bit disjointed from the rest of the game.- Some annoying invisible barriers.- Limited armour customization.- Lacked a satisfying amount of challenges.  The ones that existed were great however.- The beggars were back in numbers and in full force.- Maps seemed smaller than in previous installments.- Game crashed at least half a dozen times while I was playing it, especially for extendedperiods of time.- Story was quite short.- Faction missions were lacking.- Cappadocia was underutilized.- Gameplay is primarily presented for experienced Assassin's Creed players.Assassin's Creed: Revelations is another solid release in Ubisoft's franchise which wraps up a lot of loose ends in the story left open by the previous installments.  The introduction of the hook and bomb construction added a new and interesting element to the game as did the ability to play as Ezio, Altair and Desmond throughout the games story.  I did however feel that out of the previous three Assassin's Creed releases this was the weakest.  This by no means warranted a lower rating in my opinion but I did feel there were things that felt rushed, incomplete or simply too short.  That being said Assassin's Creed: Revelations is sure to please the majority of fans of the franchise.  I'm eagerly looking forward to the next installment in 2012.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

The left to right gun movement while in aim LT mode is sluggish, Ive preferred a option to change L/R gun speed in options menu. And there are at times to many orders and commands to give in the middle of gun fights. Sometimes it takes away the fun factor of playing a game.But I have to say this still is a great game , The weather effects look quite nice on my LCD TV 1080i . There's one desert type MAP where there dust devils are swirling around in the distance which looks quite nice , some of the best ive seen on a console system. Also I like how sometimes if I die and reload a checkpoint ..the weather has comepletly changed from sunny to dense fog type conditions.And if you go very slow in a map you'll see it go from sunny to dark night, which adds to the koolness factor. The A.I. isnt very agressive I dont remember ever being flanked one time. So dont expect VEGAS SIX type enemies. I do feel that many elements of the graphics are nicely done ,especially the weather. But I will say if you dont have HDTV you might get a different impression. If your a fan of GRAW1 you should be happy with this game. But the A.I. does seem less intelligent than games like Rainbow Six Vegas, or GEARSofWAR.But I still had funplaying it. After playing the spectacular GEARSofWAR and R/S-VEGAS story campaigns a bazillion times its nice to have something fresh to run through.

And the online action is where this game is at.  On with the review.Story:Your character has absolutly no personality of any kind, but thats kind of ok in this game, because the stories actually about the main bad guy and your adventures with him through the magical talking book.  The stories told like creepy little kid fairy tale, outlining the different event that gotten the main bady to where he is now. but within the actually battles there is little to no story or point to your action besides the grind and to get a better ranking in the mission.  don't expect the story to drive you further along in the game.  it's just there for the people that aren't playing online.  Also in the side mission section there are basic grinding missions and a story based section which lets you follow a random character on their quest to get more powerful.  Like the first guy who just really wants to make his fortune so all the monsters in his section are gold looking.  stuff like that.Mission system:You select your mission from the chapters in the book.  and any mission can be replayed besides for mystery missions.  Which are mad dashes to find all the items before the shadowy monsters kill you.  At the beginning of each mission your given a picture of the main bady in the arena or items you'll need to collect and told what items you can get if you do well. you can then set of your characters magic build, party if it's a side mission and then off to battle.Sacrifice System:First off, the game has a Show Mercy or Sacrifice feature.  Basically when you kill an enemy you have the choice of sacrificing them which charges your spells so you can keep using them or showing them mercy which give you some health. Eitherway it must be done to level up. After each boss encounter the boss will turn humanoid and say \"please I don't want to die...\" and if you show them mercy they with often become a partner for you to use offline in the dungeons, or you can sacrifice them.  which gets you really nothing other then sacrifice points.  Kind of always felt forced to save them at least once to get them as a character, but sometimes by choosing one or the other the next level will change which gives it a strange replay-ability.  On top of the sacrifice system is a kind of ultimate weapon sacrifice, if you sacrifice one of your limbs you can do a ultimate attack, but if the attack fails you can get drastically hindered.  one of the attacks makes you sacrifice you eyes, great hold attack so you party can attack the monster freely, but if the monster survives you wont be able to see easily.  so planning out your sacrifice is key, afterwards you have to recharge the sacrificed limb using tears you collect from the book, or you'll remain damaged.Battle System:Expect to fight a ton of the same looking monsters in very similar looking arenas. variety isn't this games strong soot. That said boss battles are fun and further and further into the game i got, more difficult the bosses get along with the different tactics they use. If you or a fellow comrade dies in battle you also have the choice to give them life, or sacrifice them.  If you sacrifice them they are lost for the rest of the battle but they give off a huge chain blast thing, which can win you the battle. In offline you are given the option when you die and the AI just does it, in Online the random people are give the responsibility to choose.  expect to be sacrificed.Magic System:So this game isn't about weapons like in monster hunter, it's about magic spells and crafting them.  Magic spells by themselves can only be used a certain amount of times or they'll break and you wont be able to use them until you fix them in the main book section.  but by doing different things in battle you can replenish them. Sacrificing an enemy, charging your self on the random sparkly things in the arena are the two main ways.  its makes you very aware of you characters attacks and makes you unable to spam which is nice.Character Built:Tones of different stuff to unlock through out the campaign and you can change any of it at any time, including the sex of your character and name.  very nice.  don't need to pay get an outfit in this game.  though face building is extremely limited.DLC:At least on the japanese PSN its been have regular free monster updates every few weeks, and only has one DLC for charge which is the online pass.  hopefully america will get the same treatment.Good:*Story style and artwork is kind of fun for a game that could so easily have nothing and only support the online part.*Magic limiting - attack management got tactical during battles.*Crafting*Magic variety is huge.  full of defense, attack and support spells.* graphics are pretty, and great art design.*difficulty level.  I could mostly beat any monster i was at, but it would take me forever if i was way to under leveled and my score would be terrible, and i wouldn't receive any items worth noting. So you get the satisfaction of winning, but nothing more.Cons:*Controls i play game inverted, and when i try to aim the game will switch to everything to be backwards for me.  non inverted gamers will not notice this problem.* Missions variety, lots of rat battles, and cats.* AI is dumb.  expect them to fire fireballs hitting you instead of the monster all the time. Or run straight at an attacking enemy. at least their attacks don't hurt you.Conclusions:Games great, i've put about 40+ hours into it, and can easy pick it up which watching some TV and battle me some monsters.  I do not recommend this to any one that is a story oriented gamer, this game will most likely disappoint. But anyone that likes collecting and crafting, and doesn't mind some grinding.  it's a great buy.  and a Vita much needed exclusive.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2013"}

Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Sal Paradise \"ethanallen95\"","summary":"In The Fashion of KOTOR","reviewText":"I believe this game is alot better than the resent KOTOR II.

It is quite fun for a few hours as you learn to play and develop your agent, but quickly becomes repetitive and then it abruptly ends.You begin the game with the agent a rather wimpy version of his future self. As you shoot, jump, lift, drive and explode things around all of this will improve. This stage is really fun, you go cracking down on the first gang, killing henchmen until working your way to the head guy. It is really fun to fight throwing a trashbin around and then see the agent becoming stronger and able to fight throwing cars or trucks around. As most have already mentioned the jumping interface is quite fun and give a real sense of freedom and superhero look.The graphics are above the old generation consoles but way below what the new generation is capable of.  That said it has a charming cartoony look that fits with the game mood of a super police agency battling crime.The problem is that the game is basically the killing of the three gangs, by the middle of your war with the second one you will already have you agent at his maximum stats and killing henchmen will start to look all the same. By the time you reach the third gang it is a chore. Besides, after you wipe out the crimelords in the city there is nothing really fun to do other than start all over again; the game doesn't pack that many hour of gameplay as a result.Why the relatively high score? The early game is really fun, the mixture of driving, shooting and kicking badguys around is hard to forget; and allows one to forgive the boring second-half and endgame.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2009"}

With the hotly-anticipated God of War III coming out on PlayStation 3 next year, Sony felt that those who've never played the first two games would be missing out.  Enter God of War Collection, which is a brilliantly remastered package containing the first two games in the series.  And what a package it is!The two games have been remastered in 720p high-definition, 2x anti-aliasing and upgraded to a smooth-as-silk 60 frames per second.  The result is striking.  I certainly did not expect the difference to be that noticeable, but I was awestruck when the first level began.  The game looks crystal clear (and if you've played PS2 games on an HDTV, you'll know how blurry they look!).  The game moves EXTREMELY smoothly, and the screen tearing that plagued the games on PS2 are completely gone.  This game looks and plays immaculately, and could almost pass for a current-generation game.  The content of the games are identical, so there are no extras beyond what was included in the PS2 releases (and yes, the content on the bonus DVD that was packaged in God of War II is here as well).  Also included is a voucher for the God of War III demo, which is definitely something to behold.If you've never played these games before, you simply need to get this game right now.  It's one of the best gaming experiences you'll ever have.  Santa Monica Studios created a game that is downright flawless in execution.  The hack and slash elements are kept fresh, and never feel like \"button mashing\".  The play control is perfect.  I can assure you that you will never ever feel like the controls get in the way.  They're responsive and precise, and you'll be amazed at how easy it is to control Kratos through various situations.  The puzzles are just amazing and the level design is atmospheric and perfectly crafted.  Not to mention, these games have one of the best soundtracks ever.  The storyline is very original, and never feels contrived.  This is storytelling at its greatest.One minor gripe, the pre-rendered cutscenes are still in standard-definition, so it's a notable drop in quality, but it doesn't break the game in any way, and it's much less noticeable in God of War II.PlayStation 3 owners that have never played these games before need to try it out.  Plain and simple.  And if you have played them before, you will have a great time playing them again in HD.  For $40, this should be a no-brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E3C8","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"A humorous puzzler that doesn't rush you","reviewText":"I know I initially thought this game had a few controlling drawbacks, but I can't honestly remember what they were. Once you're fully experiencing the campaign, the inventiveness is really that impressive. There are two things that really stood out for me about this game. Firstly, it almost always let you take your time in figuring out the puzzles. You'll nearly never be rushed through anything in this game. Secondly, none of the puzzles ever feel stale. You will rarely know what to expect from puzzle to puzzle. And it really does challenge your lateral thinking capabilities. This game is one massive exercise in creative thinking. Another great thing you'll find is that the solo campaign and the co-op campaign are completely different experiences. You won't simply be playing the single player campaign with a friend at your side. You're going to get 40 or so levels of challenges you couldn't complete alone, which can't be found in the single player mode. The trophies have been a blast to chase after thus far. And this is also one of the ONLY first person games I've ever played in which you actually feel as though where you're looking is where you're headed. What I mean is that you don't constantly have to worry that your unseen feet are going to trip you up. You open a portal, jump towards it, and you'll make it through; so long as you're facing it. Most first person games are not controlled as well in this regard. The game is perfect for all ages; as there's no real violence, or strong language, co-op promotes teamwork, and the difficulty isn't frustrating the same way it is in most games. The frustration here is all in thinking your way through the puzzles, or timing something appropriately. This is one of the few gaming experiences which was so engaging that, no matter how exhausted I became attempting to find the solution to a puzzle, I refused to look the solution up online. The replay value is quite high. And if you can't tell by now, I could probably carry on this way about Portal 2 for at least twice as long as I already have.

This game has changed everything for me.There are things I love, and things I don't love about this game....allow me to share:PROS:LEVELING UP is so much fun....from health to new combos, to harder attacks and bonuses, the leveling up is great.STRUCTURE: The game tends to keep you moving, just nudging you in the right direction either into a side mission or main mission.WEAPON CHOICES: From bricks to golf clubs to chain saws, there is an unlimited supply of stuff to kill zombies with.INDIVIDUAL ZOMBIES: You definitely get the feel that these zombies have less of a pack mentality than the first one.GRAPHICS: The graphics seem to be good, but that is my opinion and I am not much of a graphics guy per say.COMBO WEAPONS: These can be created easily, and on the fly without a work bench....I find them easy to do which is great.BOSSES: I completely love bosses....if I can have a boss, I'm a happy guy, it's classic video gaming!CONS:Camera: Sometimes I feel like the camera is doing what it wants, and not showing me the perspective I need..Lag in controls....sometimes I feel like the controls are not doing what I ask of them in a timely manner.CONCLUSION:Don't expect a launch game to be perfect, but if you are not looking for a masterpiece I think this will turn into your favorite launch game pretty easily.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Dead Space fans should be thrilled. I thought I'd be used to some of the scares and Dead Space 2 wouldn't initially be as effective as the first time I played the original. But I was already crying for my mommy even in Chapter 1.It looks like now you only know that the chapters are changing when you see it in your game save. You'll recall in the first game that each chapter ended with a tram ride, so there was never any question as to when a chapter ended and a new one began. In Dead Space 2 there's clearly been a change to that system. Maybe it spells out chapter changes on the screen or something, and I'm just too busy looking over my back for necromorphs to notice. But as of the first few chapters it looks like the chapters just change without any blatant notice.Everything in Dead Space 2 screams terror, and everything is presented (once again) terrifically! You're Isaac Clark and you've woken up on some space station or something and you have no idea how you got there. There's good news and bad news. The bad is that this space station or whatever it is seems to have been made home to a breed of creature that Isaac had recently been made familiar with in the last Dead Space; the good news is that at least you're somewhat familiar about how to deal with this issue...and in the first few moments of the game you are rudely reintroduced to some old friends.The creatures in Dead Space 2 are familiar and scary. When they're not scary they're disturbing. When they're not disturbing they're viciously ruthless, and there are some new ones to look out for. The background sounds are again creepy and send chills down your spine. The background music is orchestrated precisely, and it builds you right up to a heart attack when the action starts. The graphics are great and the environmental layout and surroundings  are super realistic.Your initial protection as third person Isaac Clark is lame, so you need to find a suit, weapons and ammo fast. But the melee controls are a lot better than the first game. I've already noticed a huge improvement on the dynamic of using Kinesis as a way to pick things up and launch them at attackers. The game is clearly leaving more items laying around for you do exactly that. Just like in the first game you upgrade your weapons as you progress through the game and you wear an upgradeable suit that shows your health via illuminated LED lights on the spine of the suit. (The Zealot Suit that came with the Collector's Edition is very cool.) You again have a holographic HUD that you can bring up at any time to show your inventory & objectives. And there again are save stations throughout the game positioned almost everywhere you start hoping for one.Dead Space 2 is just awesome! And to top it off if you're new to the franchise, you can pick up Dead Spacereally cheap at Amazonand play that first which I'd highly recommend, but it's certainly not necessary.Just a few quick words about the Collector's Edition. Here's what was in the box: Game w/Extraction included, Online Pass code for \"Online Features and Zealot Suit\" (haven't tried online yet and might not even bother), Plasma Gun Replica (no, it's not a real Plasma Gun, so quit complaining), soundtrack CD and a Necromorph postcard.Sick. Game. Again! Did you like the movieAliens? Do you like to be scared? Add this to your cart, but prepared for an adventure that's perhaps more intense than any movie you've ever watched or any game that you've ever played...except for maybe Dead Space 1.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

I mean when you're walking along a path of bodies and can't tell who will attack you as these zombies sometimes strike quickly with no warning or noise to alert you that they are one of the walking dead you can't help but feel some trepidation going down the path.The game allows you to choose about four different characters each with their own pros and cons of attributes but most times in the game it doesn't feel like ti makes too much of a difference though I've only tried two characters so far.  The controls are pretty easy to learn and use as is the upgrade feature so no worries about anything to confusing.So for gaming fans looking for a good hardcore zombie action game here's a great one to try out and for those who felt somewhat disappointed with RE5 and RE6 this game will raise your spirits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Excellent","reviewText":"I want to keep this simple - Dark Souls 2 is another great game, equally as impressive as it's predecessors. But I also want to tell you about what to to expect.First of all you don't need to play the other two games before attempting this one - they are all separate stories and experiences. Dark Souls 2 is almost identical to Dark Souls though in a lot of the mechanics of the game. I really recommend picking up the other two first - they are bound to be available at lower prices now, so it would be ideal to start with those and then move onto this one...so I am going to review this assuming that readers have played both of the original games.So yes players should feel immediately at home. There is a tutorial session to start you off, with some easy enemies and some very mild predicaments to get through - plus a few nasty surprises of course, to make sure you get used to dying! Once this is over you will reach the games central hub, which is the place you need to return to over and over again to level up. Branching from here are paths to other places to explore, and as usual, nothing is really spelled out for you, so off you roam, attempting to explore areas and discover new items, weapons and armour, open new doors and try to kill everything before it kills you.As you'd expect, the environments are spectacular. Castles, ruins, lakes, forests, pits and dungeons, everything you would expect is here. Enemies are merciless, so you have to take every precaution to fight well and never be lazy or impatient. This makes for nail biting gameplay, and as before, huge relief when you reach a milestone or a bonfire.Changes players may have heard about...fast travel between  bonfires is now available from the start - this is a great idea. Most notably for soul gathering, because the reward for making it to a bonfire is that if you save/rest, and then walk back the other way that you originally came from, nearly all the enemies will now no longer be able to surprise you, in fact a lot of them have their backs to you. Sweet revenge! You'll need to make the most of advantages like this to gather more souls, as enemies do not respawn forever any more, so eventually you'll be playing a game with a lot of empty and lonely environments (if you replay each one to the point where the enemies don't come back any more). Good news for cowards (like me) in that you can now make clear runs to reach bosses, rather than arrive at a boss gate every time with half your healing supplies wasted on the route just to get there. Particularly kind at pathways like the one with the gang of corrosive mushroom beetles which was right by a bonfire - so there was no running by that impediment without all your weapons and armour falling apart. Those beetles had to DIE!Apart from this almost everything else is the same. There are tons of weapons, armour, spells and items, and by the end my inventory was overflowing with stuff I never used. You can't try and use everything, but the game lets you choose your own style, so you can focus on what works for you. Bosses are of course as punishing as before, and very cruelly, some ( The Pursuer, the Smelter Demon) become available at a time when you have no chance of beating them, but of course when you take up certain challenges is up to you.There are still things I don't like. I play for the in-game challenge only and I really resent the fact that other players can invade your game and kill you for fun, if you play online. I think this causes frustration, and there should have been a way to block invasions in the system options. I did resort to starting in offline mode a number of times just to stop this.If anything though, I think Dark Souls 2 is actually kinder than the two first games. The fast travel between bonfires and the clearing out of enemies can be a real relief. Reports on the fact that each death lowers your maximum health bar is just scaremongering - in the previous games, being dead (\"hollow\") always made you play with a shorter health bar. Here it just gets gradually shorter starting from the full amount - and it stops once you reach halfway, so this is actually hardly different at all. Plus, not long into the game you get a ring that makes health loss stop at three-quarters full, which, once you find you will equip immediately and never remove again. Make sure you don't miss it! On that topic, it's hard to resist playing the game without constant reference to online forums and guides, as everything is so cryptic within the game itself. Some of it's secrets are so well hidden, chances are you'd never ever stumble on them without help. Using on line help is the cowards way out...it would taker stronger nerves than mine to play without assistance of any kind.I still recommend Dark Souls 2 wholeheartedly. Be brave and dive in, as even the scarediest player will eventually learn how to progress, and the thrill of beating the bosses is unrivalled in my experience of gameplay, because you really earn it every time. My greatest admiration and respect go to the creator of this series for the hideous and cruel (yet still beautiful) worlds they have created","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2014"}

Users can review games and take screenshots, share with friends and review them on Bungie's web site.The campaign supports 4-player co-op over Xbox Live, a feature that is quite fun and amazing.Aside from that, the game itself demonstrates the power of the Xbox 360 nicely.  The graphics, in my opinion, are fantastic.  People poo-poo the graphics, but there are always going to be people who are never satisfied no matter what.  Other than the obvious, there are a tremendous amount of little things that add to the greatness.  For example, shell casings that pop out of the gun actually make a sound when they hit the floor.Then there's the enemy AI.  On Legendary, you can really tell the quality of the AI.  Brutes work in packs to surround you.  They organize strategic group-assaults on your position and command smaller units around.  It's pretty impressive if you know what to look for.

There is the college girl named Zoey, the Bad looking biker who screams like a girl when in trouble named Francis, the Grizzled old Vietnam war vet reliving his war days, Bill and the Shaun of the Dead-esque assistant store manager named Louis who seems to view this Zombie crisis as just another bad roll of the dice in his life.  All of them are entertaining and a joy to have around.  They all have some great ineraction with another and Louis and Francis in particular have some pretty funny one liners.  Playing as each character offers the same experience, none have strengths or weaknesses but you'll more than likely pick a favorite for reasons of your own.  It is good they all play the same because this is a coop game and if people are fighting in the pre-game lobby because they want the \"best\" character, your coop experience will not be so great.There is a Zombie Apocolypse, and these are 4 immune survivors who need to do nothing other than survive and get to a rescue transport.  This is the story of Left 4 Dead.  Those looking for a deep story and enfolding plot lines as you progress will need to look elsewhere.  You will not find it here.  There is only one cutscene even, before the title screen, which is pretty intense and leads right up to the beginning of the first \"campaign\" of the game.  After this cutscene, nothing.  Not even after you beat a campaign, just credits and stats at that point (which are neat to look at so you can point out to your teammate that it was in fact HE who was producing the most friendly fire and using all the health packs).  The gameplay is what counts and it is fantastic but it would have been nice to see more cutscenes before each campaign begins.  The one they do have is pretty awesome.Left 4 Dead tries, and succeeds, at replicating the old Zombie horror flick feel.  There are 4 campaigns, which are essentially movies with their own names.  The name of each campaign/movie has just the right level of cheese to it.  The first one is named \"No Mercy\", where you are trying to get to a hospital (Mercy Hospital) which has a helipad on the roof.  The catch line for this movie is \"curing the infection, one bullet at a time.\"  It's so bad it's great! I love it.  The B-movie take adds much personality to the game.  Another campaign, where the survivors are trying to get to a boat is called \"Death Toll\".  Get it?  Oh God.  lolThe presentation with the B-movie twist is excellent and the graphics back the game up just fine.  Now this game runs off the source engine, which Half-Life 2 runs off of.  The source engine is 4 years old and is not known as a graphical powerhouse but does the best physics out of them all.  Left 4 Dead is no Gears of War 2 or Oblivion, but she is still pretty enough that you'd take her home without needing to be drunk.  The environments are dark and cryptic with all sorts of little details thrown in.  In a hospital level you can find an X-Ray room which has the thumbless Left 4 Dead hand X-ray image up on a board, next to an X-ray of the missing thumb.  On the walls throughout the levels are graffiti or messages which give you clues about what sotry there is, where to go, what happened to those there before you (which adds even more to the atmosphere of the game) and even bathroom stall like one liners and arguments.  On one particular wall someone wrote, \"we deserved this!\", underneath this ominous statement is a response, \"maybe you did, but I didn't do anything!\".  Little things like this add to the high level of detail and atmosphere this game offers.Expanding further on detail, there are hundreds of different zombies in the game.  If you actually took the time to look at each one you would rarely see two Zombies that look exactly alike.  It is also depressing to see that these were once regular people, now turned into flesh eating monsters.  You will be attacked by what once was a soccer mom, a trendy young college girl, a cop, a business man, a national guardsmen, etc.  the lighting and shadows and framerate in this game are excellent and you will always be spooked out by your surroundings.  The environments however are not all that destructable.  As a zombie (in versus mode) you can knock down doors and certain walls, but as a survivor you can't interact all that much with the environment.  What you can do is find numerous escape routes if you look hard enough.  Jump out a window to land safely on a pile of trash bags, creep out onto a ledge or find a stack of crates that leads to an otherwise hidden room.  Windows can at least be broken, doors can be shot through, some doors leading to secret areas can be busted down and there is the occasional TV or strobe light you can blast away.  Otherwise the environements aren't too interactive, but there is plenty to do in them.  The framerate is smooth and the lag is minimal to nonexistant.Gameplay is where its at and gameplay is where this game Excels.  The core formula and mechanics are simple, 4 people with access to pistols (single to dual wielding), Uzis, Shotguns, Automatic Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Hunting Rifles (sniper), Molotov cocktails and Pipe bombs.  There are also Gasoline canisters and mini propane tanks you can pick up, throw and shoot to cause fire and explosions.  All of these weapons serve their purposes well and have their strengths and weaknesses.  Aside from Atmosphere and detail being key strengths in this game, Balance is another one.  You may have your favorites, but there really is no \"best\" considering the many different situations you find yourself in.  You often have to either work with what you have and/or plan ahead and devise a victory/exit strategy.  Some have complained that they wanted more weapons, namely a Flame Thrower but it is not needed at this time.  Maybe in a later update to the game the devs can add it in but what we have now works great.  This game is not about super weapons and blasting everything to oblivion, it is a strategic affair where you are constantly at threat and feeling vulnerable.  A flamethrower would cause many problems because friendly fire is always on and someone would no doubt cook their entire team with one.  Molotovs do just nicely, learn to love them.The game will often throw whatever its got at you, and then let up if you are under too much stress.  This element of the gameplay is called the A.I. director.  This director is what makes every level different everytime you play through it.  Health, weapons, secondary weapons and enemy spawns are different throughout each level and can change on the fly.  If the director feels like you are getting a free ride, a horde of Zombies will be thrown at you, then another soon after.  If you've been getting your fair share of stress, you may suddenly realize things have gotten quiet (often a little too quiet) so you can heal or take a breather.  The A.I. director works very well and is definitely not a gimmick.  You really feel like some unseen force is always watching your progress, contemplating its next move (some liken it to a Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons, I never played that so I wouldn't know for sure).Strategy is a big part of the gameplay.  Run N Gun tactics will get you killed fast, along with the rest of your team.  All 4 of you need to work together as one.  The game does not just encourage this, it forces you to do this at the higher difficulties.  You will learn to adapt to each others play styles so you don't shoot one another and can cover each others backs effectively.  You will learn the importance of advancing in a triangular formation to cover all your sides.  You will learn the importance of having the two in front to duck down so the two in back can fire over their heads harmlessly at whatever threat lies ahead.  You will learn to always have someone periodically check your rear so you don't have a Scooby-Doo scenario where everyone is tip toeing along, with a monster tip toeing right behind them.  You will learn to conserve your ammo, fire at different targets and wait until others are reloading before you start to fire.  You will learn how to avoid friendly fire and the importance of melee.  You will learn the importance of pipe bombs and molotovs, especially pipe bombs which have a beeping sound to it that attracts zombie hordes, perfect for getting them off of you if you're overwhelmed.  You will learn to listen to your surroundings.  There are what are called \"special\" zombies in this game.  A Boomer which is an obese Zombie often can be heard belching and gagging in the distance.  He is dangerous, if he vomits on you, or if you shoot him too close and he expodes on you, then a horde of zombies will immediately jump you to feast.  Apparently that things bile is a treat for the zombies.  There is the smoker zombie who coughs and wretches like he has emphysema.  He can often be heard behind your team, where he tries to pick one of you off while the rest are distracted.  Whoever has the rear needs to look out for this smoker because he can do serious damage to a team by separating them.  There is the hunter zombie which can be heard growling and often pounces on a you from the shadows.  The only way to get him off is to have a teammate shoot or push him off (team work, always).  There is the Tank which is this massive hulking monstrosity that is a pain to Take down and you must always prepare for at every moment, no matter how rare he might be.  There is the Witch, which sounds like a harmless little girl crying alone in the darkness, but if you disturb her, instant death for you.  The A.I. director, the special infected, the necessary team work (stay together always!) and the tactics you are forced to use make this one hell of an experience.  The control is perfect and responsive and the gameplay is just intuitive overall.The sound is great, as I touched on.  It is an integral part of the gameplay for you need to listen to your surroundings for clues of what is coming up next.  The little music that there is, is haunting, and the music that starts when a horde or tank is upon you gets your heart pumping.  The best and freakiest music of all is that of the witch when she is nearby and/or disturbed.  This music combined with her cries is hard to describe, all I can say is it is disturbing and will leave you cold all over.Some say this game is short.  If you play it on easy or normal, and are good at FPS then yes it is.  Those modes are just for messing around or to try and get achievements more easily.  Advanced offers more challenge but as long as you play as a team, you should progress just fine.  The real challenge, and in my opinion the real game, can be found on Expert mode.  This is where you are forced to play as a team and stick to all the tactics that work and learn from the ones that don't.  This is where you can spend 20 mins discussing a plan to ward off the hordes in the finale of a campaign before they are alerted.  This is where you are made into a better player and feel the true tension and fear this game can dish out.  I have put in dozens and dozens of hours into the game on expert and only beaten 2 of the 4 campaigns.  I highly recommend playing this game on Expert, it is not so much a harder difficulty than it is a completely new and different game.  Never before has dying in a game been so much fun.Besides 4 person coop you have Versus mode where you can play as the special Zombies (except the witch).  This mode is so much fun.  Pouncing on players as a Hunter zombie or smashing them around as a Tank never gets old.  I personally love puking on them as a Boomer, there is something satisfying about that and snagging a straggler as a Smoker with your 100 ft tongue and pulling him further away from his team is one of the best feelings you can get in a game.  That's one way to teach someone about the importance of teamwork.  teamwork is just as important in Versus as it is in the campaign.  Zombies need to employ teamwork too!Downsides to this game are few so I'll just quickly go through them:- This is a multiplayer centric game, an awesome one at that, but it is impossible to beat the game on expert with the AI controlled bots and it's just not as fun.  You want to play with people.  There really isn't much of a single player experience to be had, though it is still an average experience, and is better than alot else that is out there.- Right now there are only two campaigns (movies) which can be played on Versus mode, though the devs are working on the other two as I type this.  They just need to balance out the maps for those campaigns.- Only one cutscene, which is very well done.  There should have been one to introduce each campaign/movie.- I hate the whole \"infection\" storyline when it comes to Zombies.  A biological explanation for Zombies is not needed and takes the supernatural allure of them away.  I prefer the \"Walking Dead\" theme, where there really is no explanation.  Like in the movie \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"when Hell is full, the dead shall walk the earth.\"  Perfect.  A minor gripe, I just ignore the whole infection theme anyway.  It's not hard because there really isn't much of a story here anwyays.- If you don't have friends to play with the game may not be as enjoyable.  Then again, I personally had nobody on my friends list that was playing this game so I went to the xbox.com forums to find people to play with and it worked wonderfully.  I also risked playing with some random players and to be honest, the community for this game is much more mature on average than that of other online shooters.  So this negative can be turned into a wonderful positive if you're not anti-social.  Meeting new people is worth it to play this awesome game.Oh one more thing, you can play splitscreen and take yourself and your friend online to play as well.  Groovy.I prefer letter Grades when it comes to games and this one easily gets an A- as well as a smiley face/gold star.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}

A. Theisen","summary":"We are Moved to Tears by the Joy of It","reviewText":"The King of All Cosmos, infamous for his continuous talk of himself and our protagonist in the second-person, is back and offbeat as ever. Katamari Forever pushes the knob up even higher by offering not one, but two Kings for your enjoyment. We are quite moved to tears by the insanity of it. The charm of the series has returned and offers even more inexplicable gameplay than before, giving us another just-for-fun and family friendly Playstation 3 exclusive. To newcomers to the series I will spell out the cardinal rule of the Katamari series; nothing will ever, ever make sense. It's not supposed to, so just go with it. Laugh at any random little thing you want, since there's no time where it would be inappropriate to laugh. Also, keep in mind that since the game is originally Japanese that a lot of the story \"animations\" and items you'll be rolling up won't be familiar to an American audience... but this doesn't at all subtract from the fun.It seems the King has lost his memory after being stuck by an asteroid during a jumping contest, forcing The Prince and his Cousins to create a robot King to keep order of the universe and create new stars. Further details are not important, but it brings us to the \"gimmick\" of this game and what gives it its depth-- besides there being plenty of new ball-rolling quests to undertake, you'll be revisiting a lot of the classics we've already seen (mostly from 'We Love Katamari'). Naturally, recycled content can only count so much, but it's rewarding and fun to play them all over again now with high definition graphics and a storyline even sillier than last time.Well then, time to get being your infinitely-sticky katamari and roll up the galaxy once more, one room at a time. The game controls remain wonderfully simple and precise, with all game control done with the two analog sticks. Turns, spins, etc... all of it is done without having to push a button, and the game even makes use of the L3 and R3 buttons as one of your special moves. One new feature here is the \"Prince Hop\" jump which comes from the motion sensing of the Dualshock 3 controller. It can be kind of awkward and requires one to be sitting up perfectly straight to pull off, but there don't really seem to be any times during the game where you're forced to use it. Consider it just an optional bonus wacky game feature.Just in case your eyeballs weren't already popped open and fixated on the blob of items before you, there are some beautiful new artistic touches added. The tried-and-true \"old\" graphics are gone-- not the modeling, but the coloring and shading. \"Watercolor\" and \"Sketchbook\" are good words to describe the environment you'll find to start. In case these don't quite sit well with you, there is an option you can unlock that changes the style to your choosing... including the original coloring and filter you're accustomed to. One quite clever graphical gimmick is that when 'recreating' a katamari from the past to return the King's memories, the level will start out as little more than a black and white fuzz outline of the environment. Quite literally, you're digging around his memory and fixing it. As you roll over objects and get larger, more and more comes out in color.As is tradition for the series, the soundtrack is top-notch ...in its wildly quirky style, mind you. A lot of the songs are remixes of things we've heard before, but it sounds fresh nonetheless and never gets dull no matter how many times you might repeat a level. Just in case you're sick of a default music, you're free to change the track before you start your next adventure. Along the same lines as the music never getting dull, the levels won't wear your out and you'll likely be repeating levels several times in order to get better results and try to drag out even a few words of praise from the King or Robot King. Besides just the normal size and time results from the past, you're now given a letter grade mark as well as a score on a scale of 1 to 100. Getting top ranks over 80 can be quite challenging, so try to look past how depressed and sad the Robot King gets when things don't go quite right and keep trying. Replay value is, thus, excellent.Of the few critiques I might give is a lack of online play. There are leaderboards for results of the normal missions and there are 2-player game modes, but nothing you can do with a distant friend or random player. Since this is far from a competitive game once can forgive Namco for not wanting to pit players against one another competitively, but the option for it still would have been nice. Besides that, I really don't know what the game could do to warrant a 5-star rating... but there is only so much a game like this can do. It will never be an epic multi-million pop culture title like Action and Role Playing games can, but then again this is never supposed to be. Why try to fix what isn't broken? This is both the basis for fun and the crutch of the Katamari series.What are you waiting for? Get rolling! We eagerly await your results. Though far from a deep and complex puzzle game, Katamari Forever will give a great 'smiles per dollar' rating on the purchase price and is the type of game absolutely anyone can pick up and enjoy just like the other games in the series. Very few other games can manage to appeal to all ages and audiences like 'Katamari' can.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

It's nice to play as Sean Connery since Pierce is no longer Bond.I like the fact that it'll save throughout different points in a mission, so you don't have to totally redo them from the beginning if you should happen to die.  I wish you could retrace your steps back to a previous section to pick up needed armor in case you go into it less than 100%.  The driving takes a little getting used to since it's very sensitive.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Viper","summary":"A satisfying finale to the Modern Warfare trilogy","reviewText":"Many were left disappointed with MW2's cliffhanger ending. Although we all knew that there would be a third game, we were left craving for more. Well Modern Warfare 3 is here but does it live up to the hype?Campaign: The Campaign has the same awesome quality that the COD series is known for. Although the main appeal is the multiplayer the campaign should not be overlooked. It provides a nice finale to the Modern Warfare series. I wont spoil it but its primarily about finding Makarov and WW3 which is an international conflict between Ultranationalist Russia and Europe and the United States. You start out fighting your way through a war torn NYC which concludes with a helicopter gunship battle over manhatten. Later you'll attempt to retake a hijacked airplane, chase down terrorists by train car in the London subway, provide cover fire for your team from an AC-130 gunship, and fight through the streets of Berlin. The campaign is intense, visceral, and satisfying.Multiplayer: Sadly this is where the game suffers. The multiplayer seems like a step back from MW2. On the plus side its still the same fast paced action that you know from previous COD games. They also have a weapon level system which to me is the best way of unlocking the attatchments. They also got rid of some of the more overpowered perks such as stopping power and one man army and fixed others such as scavenger. Theres also a new game mode called Kill Confirmed which is pretty fun. The killstreaks have also been revamped into point streaks which are put into \"Strike Packages\". Some of the new killstreaks are pretty cool such as the Osprey Gunner and Reaper Drone. Also there is the new support package which continues stacking even after you die and then there is the specialist package which allows you to access more then three perks. Now on to the bad part. First the spawn system is horrible in this game. Sometimes you'll spawn only to get killed three seconds later and this might happen who knows how many times. Second many of the maps are just flat out poorly made. Some are too big which makes it impossible to find your enemy and turns a match into a game of chance, others are too small and are loaded with campers and many of them are loaded with debris, burnt out buidlings, junk, and destroyed vehicles which turn many matches into a total camp fest and makes manuvering through them very difficult. One map in particular \"Resistance\" is also loaded with parked cars on the street which if they explode can kill. Can't tell you how annoying it is to be killed by an exploding car because of someone's missed grenades. The M-16 which used to be a decent gun has now been nerfed to the point where its useless, sadly we can thank all the people who complained about this gun in previous games for that. We can also thank the complainers for the fact that explosives in this game are almost useless and Danger Close has been taken out completely, why they took it out idk because the problem perk was One Man Army and since Scavenger was nerfed I dont think there was any need to get rid of this perk. Finally some of the new killstreaks are just useless, great Examples are Strafe Run and Assault Drone, and they got rid of some of my favorites such as the Harriers and Chopper Gunner. Finally the Support Package is a bit overpowered I cant count how many times just recovered from an EMP only to have another one pulled on us by somebody in the other team. Despite all these flaws the multiplayer is still fun but they really need to fix the above for the next game.Special Ops: This is what really saves the game. Special Ops are back and those who couldnt get enough of the earlier campaign will enjoy this. These are single player missions seperate from the campaign and when you complete them on higher difficulties. Also the new Survival mode is amazing, this is in a way like Firefight from Halo. You basically have to survive wave after wave of incoming enemies while purchasing and upgrading your equipment and as you complete more spec ops missions more equipment becomes available for use. Definitely one of the high points of gameFinal Say: MW3 is a great game worth owning, the multiplayer is a step back but is still enjoyable but the real saving grace here is the Special Ops and Survival mode.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2012"}

I think those players were expecting something else and didn't get it. I think they were looking for a \"run and gun\" game or a \"pure\" GR game but this game is neither. It's definitely a thinking man's shooter that requires thinking, planning ahead, and executing under pressure, which I found to be more exciting than running around thoughtlessly on a rail.I am a huge fan of shooters and have played all big-name series (BF, COD, GR, etc) and this game is definitely one of the best I have played. GR purists would say that this game is really NOT in line with \"standard\" GR game, and I understand that, but I think it's actually a nice change. Previous GR games require you to micro-manage your team by giving them orders to execute specific actions. Future Soldier does NOT, which I found to be a nice change of pace. They find their own cover and only shoot when engaged or when you tell them to, which is very simple yet effective.Besides from not having to issues commands for everything, I also liked many other aspects of the game, such as the gadgets. I won't spoil it but every mission or two you are given a new toy to play with, and they are all very fun. Also, the weapon customization (\"Gunsmith\") is very deep and quite good. You can essentially build your own gun by choosing different parts and colors, or let the AI do it for you. You can even tell it to optimize the gun for control, power, range, or maneuverability.

Game is so addictive you can play it for hours. Exploration, climbing and jumping are well combined with stealth missions and shooting.On the other hand, jumping and shimmy-moving has been seen multitude of times, like in Jak and Daxter (also from \"Naughty Dog\"), Tomb Raider series, Prince of Persia and so on. Stealth and action are not as good as in Metal Gear Solid 4. Playability is great, but not as addictive as Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament 2004 et cetera.This game combines already existing elements into fun game and packs it all in great shiny graphics. It is kind of \"Best of\" of 3D action adventure games. I just don't understand why it got so high critics, since it lacks originality in design.I am still hardly waiting for Ico 3 to appear...or God of War 3.AFTER BEATING THE GAME:Definitely not for you if you are veteran videogamer. Game is short, story is like in Indiana Jones movie (outdated) and, in my opinion, shooting parts are really boring and can't be compared to mouse shooters on PC. Enemies look basically same through all the game.I am just trying to say critics overpraised game, this is great but NOT as good as Metal Gear Solid IV OR groundbreaking as Final Fantasy VII OR addictive as Unreal Tournament 2004  OR innovative as Diablo II OR legendary as Elite, although it got high marks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Sumbudy \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"Provided Hours of Fun","reviewText":"As the greatness that is the Nintendo Wii comes upon the twilight of it's lifecycle, I have to reflect a bit over what the system has done for me.  I'm a man in my early thirties now, so when I grew up, I grew up on Nintendo.  Sure, there was a bit of Atari action going on a little before that, but when Mario presented his mustached self, I never looked back. That very fact alone has a lot to do with the fondness I now look over Nintendo's latest incarnation; the Wii.  Much has been made over the years about how it's the lesser of the next gen consoles, what with it's subpar graphics and kiddie games.  All of us Nintendo lovers have had to put up with the scene where one of our acquaintances who loves to play Call of Duty asks us if we play on XBox live and we respond, \"No, we have a Wii.\"  Suddenly we can see the person begin to look down their noses at us as they begin to talk in a fake superior British accents about how they're sorry that we're stuck with an inferior gaming system and suddenly I feel like I have to apologize that my gaming doesn't fit their standards of gaming.That's when I have to stop myself, look them in the eye and say \"Yep, stinks to be me.  All those hours of fun I've had playing Mario Galaxies and Zelda and Metroid Primes have obviously been a huge waste of my valuable gaming time.  I see the light.\"  Pause to let the sarcasm sink in and go about my business.  Perhaps fire Mario Kart up when I get home.  The point is simply this, going in we knew the Wii wasn't going to have knock out realistic HD graphics.  And frankly, we didn't care.  We believed in Nintendo because of years of top quality games.  The motion controls are fun on the games that do get them right, but if they aren't your thing, most of the time you don't have to use them.  I myself think the motion controls are pretty cool.  Unfortunately, a lot of games didn't realize how to incorporate them and you ended up with a lot of games that degenerated into waggle fests.  But you pick up a game like Metroid Prime 3, where motion controls take an already awesome gaming experience and shoots it to the next level, then it was worth it.Sure, we saw a lot of sewage drenched filth come out on the system and had to wade through a lot of uninspired junk to find some jewels.  But when we did, wow, how refreshing was it to play those games.  This is an incarnation of Nintendo that has seen three top tier Mario Games, two Legend of Zeldas, and two Metroids.  How many generations of Nintendo consoles can boast that, apart from the original?  And graphics?  They may not have been photo realistic, but the good games that knew how to work with them and give us good art design with vibrant colors really looked great.  Take a look at the Galaxy Marios or even Mario Kart.  You could play a new Ghostbusters game on PS3 or XBox 360 that looked like you were watching a movie, or you could play a version on the Wii that looked like a slick cartoon that made you FEEL like a Ghostbuster.To me, that's what makes the Wii a success.  The fun of the games.  And yes, they weren't all kiddie games.  Try out the bloody No More Heroes or MadWorld and you'll find some slick no small kids allowed violence you'll be shocked to find on a Nintendo system.  Even first person shooters; while missing the photo real HD graphics, they control like a dream with the Wiimote/Nunchuck combo.  Point and shoot.  Super accurate.  Not everybody is a \"hardcore\" super gamer.  There are some, like me, that grew up on the Nintendo brand that love those original games and love to play the continuation of those series.  And when you throw a game changer like the Wii Sports games, it's like icing on the cake.I'll never regret getting a Wii.  For someone who didn't game much between about halfway through the N64 years to a couple of years into the Wii lifecycle, it has, in the end, provided me with hours of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"A Leap Forward in So Many Ways!","reviewText":"For all of you considering the PS3 this is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to home entertainment. Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level.First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get two USB ports. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review.I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use.The PS3 also has a photo viewer.  You can download pictures by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is.  Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. One of the features takes your pictures and gracefully places them onto a blank canvas. I think the slide shows are best when you set them to music.Next is the music player.  You can download your pics via CD which is rather quick.  I have done this numerous times putting quite a music collection on my PS3.  Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well. You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures. It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there.I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Bluray player. Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier. The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture. For many of the new movies it is almost difficult to notice a difference in a DVD picture and Blu-ray picture.Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. One feature that is sadly missing from the 40 gig is backwards compatibility.  Although you can still play PSone games, PS2 games are a no go.  As far as the games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football are deficent on the PS3 compared to XBox 360 counterparts. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this holiday season and beyond. I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360.Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. Which is obviously not very unique. The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. It did not work for me then. Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play.There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners. Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University. The program runs when your PS3 is idle. What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases. A beneficial plus to the PS3. I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems. Secondly I want to talk about HOME. No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available early 2008. This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players. I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential.2008 will be an exciting year for PS3 owners. The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games. The PS3 will have over a half dozen superb games releasing next year. Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy are just the beginning. If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3.In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $400 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, HDMI, and of course the game playing.I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2007"}

Play Freedom Fighters!","reviewText":"First off, Kane and Lynch is a game developed by IO Interactive, a company that for the most part churns out so so sequels to Hitman. Then they made a so so Hitman movie starring Timothy Olyphant. Flash forward to the present, they develop this game which is so so and before you turn around, guess what? They're gonna make a movie with Bruce Willis and Jamie Foxx. Does anyone else see a pattern?I can almost see the marketing team behind their desks. Lets make a buggy cash in game and churn out a movie for it with A list actors. Let's make the game about criminals because all these kids today love that Grand Theft Auto, look how well Saints Row did? Lets make a really average game with sucky aiming and bland graphics and see if we can keep dishing out sequels for it. IO Interactive basically sold out but my oh my, how their games are gritty and edgey. Seriously, I think they held a contest to see how many f bombs they could put in any particular part of the in game script. Yeah, a script if you can call it that, what with all the cliches tossed in for good measure and tons of nonsensical reasoning for traveling back and forth to different locales. They Went to Tokyo, left , and then went back again, couldn't they just write a second draft?All of that said, this isn't a game without it's positives. If you like the movie Heat and you really want to play through an interactive bank robbery, this might just be up your alley. This game has alot of really good set pieces like a packed nightclub with crowds that are quite impressive both technically and visually. You rappel down a highrise and are treated to a really expansive view. All of this is really nice but the bland not quite last generation graphics don't do any of it a justice. The textures just don't pop and many of the enemies and bystanders look like they came from a PS2 game.The controls in this game are an issue as well. The cover system seems random and works when it feels like it. I can't understand why this game didn't include a cover button instead. The aiming feels off as well and there are times when it appears that you hit someone but the shot doesn't register. This wouldn't be so bad but certain missions have you shooting at people speeding by in bulldozers and helicopters. That said, the command system is fairly well done but the A.I. doesn't always respond in the way that you would like. It really is frustrating to send someone to a strategic vantage point only for them to abandon it in favor of running into a hail gunfire. This too wouldn't be so bad but if one of your teammates dies, it's back to the previous checkpoint unless you can make a quick suicidal rescue attempt.IO Interactive is making a sequel to this along with the movie which is fine by me. I hope they learn from this release and make a much better game for it.Personally, what I want from them more than anything, is to make a sequel to Freedom Fighters. When I first played through the Havana level in Kane and Lynch, I realized this game blatantly copies that games command system and controls. That would be all well and good but that game was released on the PS2 in 2003 and was actually a much better game. So in closing, buy Freedom Fighters instead of this and pray they bring that series back or maybe a next gen Hitman game that isn't some lame port of an X Box game. I purchased this game for around four dollars with another four with shipping. I'm not terribly upset about my purchase but I would be furious at buying this short, generic, unfinished game at full retail. Playing cops and robbers was kinda fun but not sixty dollars worth of it. This game really isn't as terrible as some of the reviewers here say but  I think I'll wait for Kane and Lynch 2 to hit the bargain bins before picking it up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

You play a deep sea diver exploring under the sea around the fictitious island of Manoa Lai, and that's pretty much all you need to know.  All you basically do is explore the massive environments and interact with the sea-life, which provides for a soothing and even more surprisingly fun experience.  The games graphics are gorgeous underwater, with some just plain brilliant lighting effects and textures.  The graphics department gets a bit of a different story though in the game's segments that take place above the sea, but this isn't that much of an issue.  It should be noted though that Endless Ocean isn't a game for everyone.  The game's slow pace may be a turn off for some, and occasionally the Wii-mote controls don't always work the best way they should when pointing at the screen, but regardless there is much to admire here.  Also with the ability to incorporate your own MP3 music soundtrack via an SD card (in case the game's soothing score doesn't suit you), Endless Ocean is an impressive effort.

I figured it might satiate my need for a fantasy RPG, since Elder Scrolls V is still a couple of months away. Within 15 minutes I was pretty much hooked. Don't get me wrong, there are things I would like to have seen improved on, but they're minor. For instance, I'd like more variety in the geography and mission styles, and I'd love to be able to worry less about what armor I'm wearing because within 1-2 missions it's no longer the hottest item on the market. It would be nice to customize the armor of your companions and some added dimension to the custom options would have been nice. The biggest issue is probably the severe linearity of the plot. You've got essentially 3 ways you can respond to anything that it said to you in the game: nice, sarcastic, and blunt. Regardless of the tone you take, the outcome is basically the same. I wanted more plot shifts based on player choices/responses, more consequences for the decisions being made, and more complexity to the entire experience. For me, that's the ticket to a game's replay value. Doesn't exist here. However, if you're looking for a lot of fun, great action, interesting (if very linear, controlled) story, and lots of gore, this is the ticket. Much more than I expected, but could have been better still.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0009EHQVI","description":"This is the game SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs for the PlayStation 2.","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Over-rated, still no split screen co-op","reviewText":"This game, in my opinion, is over rated to say the least. Its a solid game, believe me. Nice enough graphics, some good gameplay etc. But the devs seemed to think that the world revolves around online play--it doesn't. Online is really fun, yes, but how about we get a good split screen co-op in there so two friends can play together without having to go online on more than one machine? In three games they haven't added this feature. Makes you wonder if they play test these with actual consumers at all.The much hyped AI is so riduculous that I'm embarassed for the guys that bragged about it at Sony. They should lose their jobs for being so stupid, sorry to say. The vehicles are a nice touch but poorly implemented and a bit clumsy to drive.The new weight system is nothing short of annoying. If we wanted that kind of lame realism, we wouldn't be playing video games in the first place.A fun game, but there are better ones out there for sure. Worth a rental, but certainly not 50 bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2006"}

It has the standard fare. Flashy cars, customize and upgrade them. Paint them.Criticisms:- it's not fun period.- if you dare run off the track into a little spot of dirt, you might as well be driving a turtle in a tar pit. you drop from 100mph to 0 in .1 seconds. no i'm not exaggerating.- if you happen to hit a side wall with the side of your car, instead of just bouncing back into the track with some kind of realistic action-reaction physics, you almost always have your back end spin out into the track infuriatingly. Totally unrealistic.- textures are really mediocre (backgrounds, tracks, etc).- tracks are boring. There are only a few that are inner city, downtown, with flashy lights and interesting things to enjoy. The rest are just pedestrian.- graphics in general, are just okay. This is a next-gen title, it needs immersive ultra-realism.- it gives you the illusion of track variety, but there are barely more than 10 or so...they're simply reused in different races.The closest release time-wise for comparison is DiRT, which is a more graphically pleasing, more fun game to play with a better presentation in general. Much more variety in DiRT. PGR3 is showing it's age but seems to have more variety as well and PGR4 is on the way with more promising dynamic weather effects...None of these \"sim\" type games are as fun as the non-sim racers, like Burnout. Flatout is returning with a new offering and Burnout Paradise is coming soon with a more open-world game play (like Test Drive Unlimited). These games are just simply more fun to play. Test Drive Unlimited incorporates some Sims-esk (I mean the game \"The Sims\") functions where you buy property, buy cars, put `em in the garages, test drive `em, race `em around, etc...Games like this simply have tons more to do giving you more longevity to the title. You can drive around the Test Drive island for hours and hours...And you don't sacrifice graphical quality in these titles, quite the opposite.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

You want to play more, You have to pay more. Very disappointing because it could have been a lot better if there was more content to it, Especially with Zombie mode.
