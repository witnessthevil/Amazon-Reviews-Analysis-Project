I grew up loving Final Fantasy and gave the Tales series my attention with the ps2 in regards to Legendia and Abyss; Symphonia was great on the Gamecube.  Overall Versperia is good, though a bit flawed.Graphically the game is bliss.  It was like playing an anime flick on bluray.  Everything is high resolution, the colors were crisp/bold and overall the cartoon look was incredible.  I have zero complaints about the graphics.  The sound was just as good.  The game features good use of surround sound and had a nice musical score.  The dialogue was well done.  The controls work perfectly fine and were no trouble.  The story while not the greatest ever was interesting and strong.  Each character has a unique personality and plays out different on the battlefield.  The achievements were well paced as well.The battle system is a giant hit along with a giant miss.  The Tales series isn't a click and wait rpg like Final Fantasy.  Instead it is a hybrid system, 1 part Final Fantasy and 1 part action (Devil May Cry, God of War, etc).  I love having the hybrid system, when compared to the Final Fantasy series being able to move around and actually attack keeps random battles much more interesting.  The problem comes with your teammates, who are quite frankly stupid.  The AI needs some serious work and was quite disappointing.  I lost quite a few battles because my teammates just dont' react like they should, despite having them setup in the correct way.  Overall the game was just a joy to play and is a must own for Japanese rpg fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

Rhodes","summary":"The Finest Tales Game","reviewText":"Pros:+Engrossing storyline, thanks to some well developed characters+Fun, Addictive Battle system+Very well written dialog with a good sense of humor+Good voice acting+A Fairly good soundtrack+Good looking gameCons:-A lot of story exposition, some of it not even necessary-Battling can sometimes rely on button mashing over skillThe Tales series has never been too big in America, but many of the games within the series are a blessing. Tales of Vesperia is a great outing that many fans of the series may enjoy. If this is the first time you've ever played a Tales game, then Tales of Vesperia is a good game to start with.Tales of Vesperia takes place in a world where blastia, magical properties, are used to protect the denizens from monsters. There are also knights who help out and protect the citizens of the world. You play as Yuri, a man who left the knights mainly because he didn't like how the government treated the people. Obviously, there's something else a foot. Something more that this powerful empire is hiding and as Yuri and company you're going to find out what it is.Tales of Vesperia may not have an original storyline, but it's told very well. Much of the dialog is very well written and sprinkled with its own fluffy humor. What really helps the story standout as being something much more than it is, however, is the cast of characters. They're very well developed and as you play you'll become really attached to them. Each also has their own distinct personality to help them along and they have their own charms about them. To help character development you can also watch skits, which are basically conversations among the party and they're completely optional. They really add to the characters by giving you a glimpse into just what they're thinking. If there was anything about Tales of Vesperia's story that is a little troubling, it would be that perhaps there's too much story in some areas. You'll run from one town to another only to backtrack to a previous town only to realize it was all done for story exposition and that you didn't really engage in a lot of battles. Yet, while there's a lot of exposition, there's still plenty of battling to be done.The Tales games have largely been known for their battle systems. Once a battle begins you control one of four characters. You can all run around freely and land blows akin to a hack and slash game. You can also perform special techniques called Artes which will cost you tech points. It's all very simple stuff and feels very similar to the Star Ocean games. It can feel like a button mashing affair at times, and certainly the beginning stages of the game can be that way, but as you get further into the game it becomes less about hack and slash and more about strategy. Bosses in particular can be a challenge, especially if you want to get all the achievements. Some bosses require you to do certain things in order to get the achievement for them.While you control one character the game's AI makes it a point to control the other three. Surprisingly, the AI does a very good job of keeping your characters alive and using items on allies who need them as well as healing. You can also set certain strategies and customize it up to help out. Even better than that, the game has multiplayer. Up to four players can play, although only the first player gets to control what happens in the field. For all it's worth, though, the battle system is superb.Finally, there are abilities. Characters can equip weapons that will teach them certain abilities. If they use the weapon long enough they'll learn the ability and be able to use it whenever they want, provided they have the skill points required to equip it. There's nothing difficult about learning Tales of Vesperia's battle system. It's all relatively simple and easy to pick up on. So even if you've never played a Tales game before, the battle system is easy enough to learn that it shouldn't give you any trouble.Graphics wise, Tales of Vesperia is gorgeous and runs very smoothly. Most of the dungeons you'll travel to also look nice. The enemies and bosses are very detailed and the load times are incredibly fast. The character designs are perhaps the best part as every character stands out as their own. Music wise, the game has a lot of memorable tunes that stand out. There are a few forgettable tunes but much of it really fills the situation. Much of the dialog in the game is spoken and the voice acting is very good.If you're a fan of the Tales series, this is a great game to add to that collection. If you've never played a Tales game before and you're curious about the series, this is a good game to start with. With its easy learning curve and character driven story, most RPGers will find Tales of Vesperia to be a real treat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike G \"Mike G\"","summary":"Refreshing, unique and fun...but","reviewText":"I picked this game up the day it came out and had a marathon playing it. Rockstar seems to be utilizing the same game engine to run L.A Noire with some adjustments to the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and you'll find yourself driving around the town and never really hitting the same parts of town multiple times.L.A Noire is a genius idea for a game. Being a detective and solving cases creates a very unique game play that has not been created before. This premier title brings about challenging opportunities to jump into the job as a detective and bring justice in the early age Los Angeles background. I find that at times though the game play can get a little monotonous and you find yourself solving similar crimes time after time. I also never ran into a situation where I arrested the wrong person during the crime. You can answer a question wrong, but I was never skewed off the criminals path.Rockstar throws in mini-missions to spice up the game play. During these mini-missions you are chasing criminals through L.A, involved in a shoot out, or required to arrest a suspect disturbing the peace. The shooting is pretty easy, and I never really found a challenge in any of the mini missions. They add a little spice and distraction from solving the case but nothing spectacular.Overall I think that this title has a potential to only improve and the overall experience you get from the game validates trying it out! If you have patients and like solving situations and crimes, this is a great game to get. With the long hours of gameplay, it's well worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2011"}

The wrestling-game gods over at Yukes and THQ have brought you a wrestling game with more tables, ladders, and motorcycle ring entrances than ever before. Unfortunately, they had to leave some important stuff out. Just Bring It is by far the most ambitious and complete wrestling game in history. Over 30 wrestlers can compete in well over 60 match types, ranging from Hardcore to Coffin matches to King of the Ring. If the roster's not large enough for you, you can create your own wrestler with the genre's most complete Create A Superstar mode. The PlayStation 2 really does the game justice. The wrestlers grapple and brawl with smooth realism, but the action sometimes seems stiff. Still, SmackDown's TV-style presentation will knock hardcore fans on their [butts].With all its strengths, the game's faults are tempting to ignore. SmackDown's ringside commentary calls out moves that neither the player nor the superstar even thought of performing, and the music fails, too: Generic rock-type sonic patterns back the action, and the SmackDown theme is the only other song nearby-unless you count \"Rolling\" by Limp Bizkit. Move timing seems a little off as well, making the simple moves frustrating to pull off. WWF SmackDown: Just Bring It packs in a ton of things that wrestling fans have been screaming about since WWF War Zone, but its weakness lies in the attention to the game, not to the details. Wrestling maniacs will drool ferociously for this title, but non-fans still have no reason to bring it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine.

Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS. Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily). Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2007"}

It's relatively new style of play (side-scrolling) in combination with an original story and the perfect difficulty arc (anyone can beat the beginning levels, but it takes a true pro to complete the game) made it the game that I played over and over again.  Whether it was screaming in frustration due to the Hammer Brothers, hearing in disbelief that the Princess \"was in another castle\", or the sheer joy of beating that next castle, I played the game over and over again.  Of course, being such a young child, I was never quite talented enough to complete the complicated jump moves or decipher the complex mazes (towards the end) well enough to actually beat the game.  Yet, I still had a heck of a time trying!Flash forward (LOST-style) 10-12 years later: Having been introduced to the NES at such a young age, I continued by brand loyalty to Nintendo by playing the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and Wii.  I had a lot of good times with those machines, but one day I got the urge to fire up the old NES again, for old times sake.  Within moments (well, not exactly moments, as it took some blowing on the connectors and jiggling the game up and down) I was instantly transformed back into that excited six year old kid who couldn't wait to come home from school and play Mario.  This time around, with a little practice, I was able to conquer even the final Bowser.While playing the game at that older age, though, I was amazed at the purity of it.  It was original (which can't be said about most SNES games), it was straight-forward (not like Donkey Kong '64, for example), it's difficulty arc progresses in a logical fashion (not like GCN, where in many games you have to be a master gamer to step right in), and the game's internal bugs are cute and looked forward too, not annoying and troublesome as is sometimes the case on the Wii.Thus, taking all those things into consideration, Super Mario Brothers for the NES is, at least in my opinion, perhaps the closest thing to a \"perfect video game\" as has ever been created.  Not only did it practically save the entire gaming industry, but it also gave hours of entertainment to people across the world.  To me, only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (for the '64) can challenge Mario Bros. in terms of overall game quality.So, if you are a nostalgic video gamer (like myself) who is a bit frazzled by the current obsessions and skill levels, I would highly recommend dusting of the old NES box and popping in Super Mario Brothers (it often comes on the same cartridge as Duck Hunt).  After a few moments of dickering, a few tries to re-master the old skill-sets, you will NOT be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000NJH6YG","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"The Real Gothic 3","reviewText":"I'm late to the game with Two Worlds, but I was so disappointed with Dragon Age:  Origins that I found myself looking anywhere for a real RPG that is both playable and actually fun.  I took a chance on Two Worlds despite the poor reviews, and I am extremely happy that I did.For the longest time while playing, I couldn't figure out what the game reminded me of.  And then it hit me:  Gothic/Gothic 2.  Two Worlds is extremely similar to both games, in everything from the way your character moves, to the equipment, to the magic items and spells, to the layout of the world itself.  This is a very good thing, as anyone who has played Gothic or Gothic 2 will tell you.  Some specifics:Difficulty.  The game is indeed quite difficult.  Just like Gothic/Gothic 2, you can't simply run off into the woods and hope to survive.  You have to slowly work your way up by first picking off weaker creatures near the main roads, and build up both your levels and your equipment to survive the bigger encounters.  I recommend starting on \"Easy\" which is at least the equivalent to \"Normal\" in most games.  But one key consideration is missing from most other reviews:  dying is not really a punishment in this game.  If (and when) you die, you simple reincarnate at a nearby health shrine.  You don't lose experience, stats, or even any gold.  Moreover, you reincarnate at the nearest health shrine even if you haven't found it yet -- I've accidentally teleported onto the other side of a mountain range by dying and coming back at an undiscovered health shrine.  So the difficulty is not nearly as frustrating as it sounds because you can, if you have to, just die a lot to whittle down a tough monster.  Or lure them close to a mana or health shrine that will constantly power you up as you get hurt.  And when you eventually have that awesome platemail or greatsword and can start 1-shoting monsters that have been killing you for hours, the gratification level is HUGE.Graphics.  The graphics are a little dated, but not nearly as bad as people say.  Some of the atmospheric effects, particularly fog, are very cool, and there are lots of pretty looking rivers and streams and sunsets to keep up the eyecandy level.  I'm running on 1080p HD and the graphics are as least as good as Dragon Age:  Origins -- despite being 2+ years older.Gameplay.  This one of the places the game really shines.  There are lots of different ways to play this game.  You can be a warrior with a huge axe, an archer, a mage (with many different sub-types like Earth mage or Water mage to specialize in), an assassin, a hunter, a booby trap specialist, or some combination therein.  Combat is actually a lot of fun, and there's even a backstep/dodge button that works quickly and lets you avoid big hits from other monsters.  My preferred playstyle is to set a few explosive traps, pepper foes with arrows so they charge into those traps, and then smash them with a halberd or greatsword.  But you can also summon hell knights, cast lightning storms, trap foes in magical tentacles, or do almost anything else you want.Loot.  There are tons and tons of items in this game.  You can customize your character with everything from rings (4 of them!) to armor to boots, to even an assassin knife you use only in backstabbing, or perhaps magic robes and a wizard's staff.  Items have a wide range of powers, but you can improve an item by combining it with an identical item.  This has many subtle effects, like letting you make mediocre equipment really powerful if it is common and you find it a lot, or letting you use something that looks awesome by ranking it up so it's better than the more powerful -- but uglier -- base item.  For example, I found a suit of white mirrored half-platemail that looks fantastic, but is a bit weaker than some other heavy plate.  By combining multiple sets of the white platemail, I both look good and have great armor protection.  Like Gothic 2, there are also tons of alchemy items you can find out in the woods, like mushrooms, flowers, gemstones, and the like.  Some have permanent effects, so you can quickly learn to make potions that give you permanent boosts to all your stats, or even your resistances or physical armor.  This is another great way to toughen up early in the game.Plot.  The storyline is also entirely adequate.  The voice acting in most (but not all!) places is a little amateurish, but you can skip right through it with the press of a button.  The world map is gigantic and filled with villages, towns, castles, necromancer towers, crypts, graveyards, and everything else you'd want in a fantasy world.  There are tons of side quests, and you will always have something else to do.Foes.  Another great thing about this game is the huge range of enemies.  You will face all the standard enemies from skeletons to zombies to wolves, but how about death knights, wyverns, dragons, giant scorpions, and even huge preying mantises?  Or perhaps a cave full of enraged dwarves, or huge half-demon half-snake monsters?  Enormous flesh, stone, or wood golems?  Huge orc encampments?  The possibilities are nearly endless, and there are always treasure chests and loot to be found.  Your enemies don't scale much as you level so you can go back and punish them later, but some of their inventory does scale so it is always worth checking to see what they carried.There is a lot more that can be said about this game (both archery and booby trap setting deserve their own entries) but some things should be experienced directly.  In my opinion as a long-time gamer, this game has been unfairly maligned and should be given another close look.  If you have ever played Gothic or Gothic 2, you will find this game very similar -- and a heck of a lot of fun.  I highly recommend it, and am looking forward to the sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2009"}

Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"One of the best WWII shooters I've played!","reviewText":"I just got this game earlier this year and am loving it! I'll discuss different parts of the game in their respective sections below.CAMPAIGN:The campaign of this game, in my opinion, is probably the best part of it. It's pretty long, and will entertain you for a while. No, we're not storming Normanddy AGAIN. This time, we'll be in the Pacific Theater and Eastern Front. You switch back and forth between Pvt. Miller from the Marines and Pvt. Petrenko from the Red Army. The story is very good, and they did a good job of making it exciting. It starts at the Makin Island Raid in 1942 for Miller, and the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943. The graphics are very good, and we get to use some classic WWII weapons, such as the M2 Flamethrower (one of my favorites), PPSH, and M1 Garand. There are cool cutscenes in-between levels that sometimes show actual historical footage. There are 2 special levels, one where you drive a T-34 Russian tank, and one where you're a gunner on a PBY Catalina US plane. The campaign isn't too difficult, but it's BRUTAL on Veteran difficulty. You die in only a few shots, and the enemy throw tons of grenades at you. They throw so many, it's probably the hardest part of the game. I've played through almost all of the campaign on Veteran, except the notorious \"Heart of the Reich\" level, which few people have completed. If you're having trouble with a level, I strongly suggest that you look up a walkthrough on YouTube. A side note: this game is very graphic and the characters swear a lot, so if you want, you can change the graphic content to Restricted in the main menu. This is the first COD game where you can play campaign co-op, but I personally haven't yet because none of my friends have this. Something that's very stupid in my opinion is that you only get the achievements for completing the game on veteran if you play by yourself, so it doesn't really matter if you complete a mission on Veteran with a friend. Also, \"Death Cards\" have been added to the game, which are a lot like skulls in Halo 3. If you're not familiar, Death Cards are special collectibles that you can find in the campaign which unlock cheats for co-op matches, such as enemies not dropping their weapon at death, shooting explosive ammo, and paintball bullets.MULTIPLAYER:Of course, since this game is old now and lots of new CODs have come out, not too many people play the multiplayer anymore. It's pretty fun and I've played a few matches, but now there are lots of modders which pretty much ruin the game. If you don't know what I'm talking about, modders are people who hack the game so that they get a huge advantage over the other players (i.e. invincibility, flying, extra damage) so that they always win a game. Multiplayer is filled with them, and sometimes you just can't find a match without one. As I said before, since not a lot of people play multiplayer now, it isn't really worth buying this for the multiplayer.ZOMBIES:This is an awesome new gametype for this game. Unlocked after campaign completion, zombies allows up to four players to try to fight off an endless horde of zombies, which come in rounds. For each zombie killed, you get some points. Those points can be used to open doors on the map to get around or buying new weapons (you start off with a pistol). Each round, the zombies get harder and come in larger numbers. They come through barriers, which can be rebuilt for extra points. Only one zombies map comes with the game, but three more can be unlocked by buying the map packs for the game. This mode is extremely addictive, and is fun solo or with friends.OVERVIEW:This is a great game and is avaliable at a great price. Campaign and Zombies are your main modes to play in this game since multiplayer is not very populated. Thanks!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

The story also has multiple endings (either good or bad outcome)- Variety of different locals to travel to (all done in nice detail)- Action RPG with lots of story (told through character dialogue) and real-time actionBAD:- Not a traditional RPG or a traditional beat-em-up (like Final Fight), so it might upset people looking for more of either- Slightly liner gameplay- Dialogue trees might be to long for some that want more of an action game- Some complain of long loading times, but Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic and fable had loading times just as longIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Has mythical/medieval Chinese theme- Action RPG with real time fighting (like in Fable), no turn based fighting (like in final Fantasy X) and no \"partial\" turn based fighting (like in Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic)- Light RPG elements, think of this as an RPG for people who like RPG's but hate tracking statistics and complex weapon/armor upgrading. Great for people who like action/adventure games (like Onimusha) but want a lot more story- Lot's of story and dialogue if you ever played Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic one or two you'll know what I mean.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Fable- Star Wars: Knights of the old RepublicADDITIONAL NOTES:- The special version has a bonus disc with a new playable character, weapon and a making of the game video (made by G4's show Icons)- After you beat the game and during the credits, you get some really funny dialogue from the game's main story characters","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2005"}

I'm not joking - since Codemasters made this and Dirt, the menus are very similar. they'll flash on screen with your stats (kills instead or racing stats)...Pros:- the game works. it spins in the tray.- it's not rogue warriorNeutral:- the game is trying to go for a military sim, not a military arcade shooter (i guess). i suppose it gets this right (1 shot can equal instant death), but this isn't any fun.Cons:- very short- generic story- textures are mediocre- color is washed out- you will be walking and walking and walking forever. this is utterly boring. did you get killed? since the game's checkpoints are barely existing, you be walking and walking all over again.- the gameplay is literally Ghost Recon 1. Utterly generic. follow your instructions to the next objective, kill those guys, go to objective 2, blow that thing up, go to extraction point. repeat for 10 chapters. We did this 10 years ago in Ghost Recon 1, which at the time was a great game...- checkpoints are HORRENDOUS, barely existing. in fact the checkpoint system borders on glitched. if you complete an objective, you should (and sometimes do) get a checkpoint, many or most times you don't.- healing system is almost useless, practically broken. this game uses health packs. the problem is that 1 shot (even on the lowest difficulty setting) can equal instant death. if you are lucky, you can try to heal yourself, at which time you may be shot and killed. or, you can try to have someone else heal you - the majority of the time, the guy trying heal me would get shot and killed himself just trying to reach me. realistic? i guess. fun? nope.- hit detection, hit boxes seem broken with some weapons. i can look through a scope and hit enemies dead-to-rights through the crosshairs, unload entire clips and they simply don't hit the enemy. am i too far away? dunno.Right now I'm on level 4 and will have to restart the entire mission due to a glitched checkpoint. the game barely has checkpoints to begin with, yet this one has saved right before an automatic mission failure...No reason to continue to bash this game any more...Just go play the original Ghost Recon, a far superior game...you can probably pick it up for a couple of bucks...or Dirt...Dirt was also a good game.

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap.......","reviewText":"The first original Zelda game since Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons for the Gameboy Color, Minish Cap really shines. All the classical Zelda elements are here with new elements as well such as kinstone fusion, new moves, equipment to use, etc. but the things that make Minish Cap truly shine to me are its' sharp graphics, traditional puzzles(which I love to figure out), interesting quests, and the fact that you see familiar Zelda locales such as Lon Lon Ranch & Hyrule(which kinda makes me wish, at times, that Nintendo would consider making a 2-D Ocarina of Time). Like everyone else, if I had any gripes, it would be that the final boss has to be the hardest Zelda boss in history. Once you figure how to beat 'em, it's all good and well but, til then, it's frustrating. Other than that, Minish Cap is one of the best GBA games of the year. A must own for all GBA owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Markus Egger \"www.MarkusEgger.com/blog\"","summary":"Best *experience* I ever had in gaming","reviewText":"This is an awesome game.

{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Best Game No One Played","reviewText":"Every year there are always good games that come out and that get swept under the rug for one reason or another.  They go by being missed by gamers who will only hear about them later on down the line.  Rayman Origins is one of those games.  It is a game that executes everything well.  It's a tightly put together package that's fun and rewarding based entirely on the merits of gameplay.  For those who enjoyed the platforming games such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers... Rayman Origins is a must play game.  It is by far one of the most encompassing 2D side scrollers you'll ever play.As you can imagine there's pretty much no plot to Rayman Origins.  And beyond that, Origins isn't really about any origin whatsoever.  Rather the \"origin\" refers to how Rayman used to be.  A 2D Side Scrolling Platformer.  In other words, Rayman gets back to its roots.  There are no raving rabbids here.  Just pure amazing level design.  The game is incredibly simple in its mechanics and that's part of what really makes it work.  Just about anyone can pick up the game and learn the basics of the mechanics.  Mastering the game, however, is another story entirely.The game begins simple.  The first level is inviting.  And when you first begin you'll soon earn the ability to punch before later on getting other abilities such as the ability to fly or shrink later on.  The game paces itself well by holding back on most of your abilities.  Only giving them to you when you rescue certain characters.  And mostly making sure you utilize them well in the environment they introduce them in.  The learning curve in Rayman is almost non-existent.  You'll slip right into the game real easy and the game gives you ample time to practice your new abilities.  There are four different characters to choose from, but choosing one over another doesn't really make much of a difference.  Rather, there seem to be four mainly to bring out the multiplayer.  You and three of your friends can hop on at the same time and it can be quite fun to do so... or frustrating depending on how you play.  Like LittleBigPlanet and New Super Mario Bros., less is more when it comes to conquering the campaign.  Your friends can easily mess you up or something, but it's actually not too menacing, given that it does allow for more risks when there are four instead of one.  A character can make a sacrifice for rare items.  Or you can tag in other characters when you need to.It's a good thing that Rayman Origins doesn't punish the player when things are grim, however.  The game is challenging.  It begins quite simple enough, but before you know it the game ramps up in difficulty rather fast.  You won't even be halfway through before you realize just what's being thrown at you in each level.  And some are going to require some good pattern recognition or some trial and error to get down just right.  Regardless of this, however, you rarely feel like the game is being unfair.  Most enemies are easy to take out.  It's not the enemies that'll be a problem, however, it'll mostly boil down to the environmental hazards mixed in with the well tuned level designs.  Each failure doesn't really feel like failure either, because the game isn't out to punish you.  There are a decent amount of checkpoints scattered throughout, and there isn't a limit to how many times you can fail.This is also good because Rayman Origins has A LOT of levels to traverse.  It's about as robust as a 2D platformer can get.  Each level ends when you rescue a bunch critters (called Electoons) but the game demands replay because you'll be tallied up at the end of the level.  Rescuing Electoons isn't just how you complete stages, it's how you unlock more.  And if you manage to go through a level collecting all the \"Lums\" (basically coins) then you'll rescue more Electoons.  There are also cages of captured Electoons hidden in every level.  If you want to master Rayman Origins and explore everything it has to offer, you'll need to find them all.  And this is going to require replaying some levels over and over again.  Sometimes with a friend.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about Rayman Origins is by far it's presentation.  The game has an incredible sense of humor and some great tunes.  The introduction is funny, and so are some of the levels (who would've thought using weenies as platforms wouldn't be such a bad idea?).  But perhaps where the presentation shines most is in the graphical and aesthetic capacity.  This is where Rayman truly comes alive.  The graphics opt for style more so than anything.  Certainly Rayman Origins fails to live up to the photorealistic quality of other games such as Uncharted 3 or Gears of War.  But what makes this game so important is that it showcases that style is just as important as the actual graphical output.  Rayman Origins doesn't have a lot of POWER behind it, but it has a visual flair that you just don't see too much in games these days.  The aesthetics are what make Rayman Origins so easy on the eyes.  The environments are just amazing looking.  And this is because Rayman Origins has character.  And art design that helps separate the game from everything else out there.  A lot of games look pretty based on the actual power behind them, but it's nice to see a game that treats its visuals as though they were on a canvas for an artist to paint.  It goes beyond being something shiny and something that actually exemplifies what gaming can do when developers try a stylistic approach rather than just an all out powerful one.  Every frame of Rayman Origins is brimming with visual flair and style.  It is easily one of the prettiest games I've ever seen.  The fact that it plays well makes it that much more rewarding.  At some point when playing through the levels the design just clicks and everything flows well.This, of course, brings about the issue some gamers have with the game.  Rayman Origins is a totally 2D side scroller.  All the way down to the last pixel.  The graphical power that the game DOESN'T have has caused some gamers to wonder if sixty dollars is really worth it.  This is actually much more dependent on how much gameplay you want.  Rayman Origins offers a surprisingly large amount of gameplay and depth.  It'll take you a while to do everything the game asks of you.  Primarily because in order to do it, you'll need to play through it a second time.If anything, the quality of the game speaks volumes.  The levels are incredible, it's a great looking game and it can be enjoyed with friends.  It's a game that doesn't throw in too much and manages to hit a sweet spot because of how it is stylistically constructed.  It's easy to think that EVERY game has to innovate in some ways, but gaming has come to a point where we no longer needs to try so hard to be good.  Sometimes mastering the techniques we've learned through the years is better than coming up with a new thing that fails.  It's the execution that makes the game work so well, not the standalone mechanics themselves.  Rayman Origins will surely be an underplayed game... but it most certainly won't be under appreciated.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

Anyhow I gave it a shot.  It's good. It's certainly fun, and unique. The game has a very skewed look to it, and as I was playing it reminded me of \"Day Of the Tentacle\".  Turns out, it was designed by the same guy/people!  So that answers that. With this skewed look comes a bit of a sticky wicket: Sometimes you have trouble telling where to go next, as it's hard to see exactly where to go when the world around you is all steep hills and weird stuff. The characters are good and the plot is good and the gameplay is good.  Occasionally you'll die cause the camera will screw up and you'll move in the wrong direction or it's not quite clear exactly how far a jump should be, but you get so much life it's not really a challenge.  It's a fun game to rip through, that's about it. One thing that bugged me is after winning it, that's it.  You can't go back and wander around the \"real\" world which would be nice cause there are some small things I didn't accomplish which would have been nice to do.

Prior to Metroid Prime the only other Metroid game had ever owned was Metroid 2 Return of Samus for the now outdated Gameboy. I actually had my doubts about this game upon picking it up 4 years ago because everyone carries on how hard it is to turn a 2d franchise into 3d but Retro did an exceptional job. As far as gameplay goes its top notch your gonna feel challenged with this one like a lot of Nintendo games they do not hold back either. Graphics for the time when this game came out were exceptional as well and I still find them to be excellent today. Story ? I do not play Metroid for the story as the gameplay carries this one like all Nintendo games. I like how as you go on in the game you get your suit upgraded so you can go to other areas.

To sum it up great game and lots of fun and the challenge is included.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"digitil","summary":"Fun for a few afternoons","reviewText":"This is kind of a kids' game to me.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"Diablo virgin here - it's everything I had hoped and more. Thank you Blizzard!","reviewText":"I am and shall always be a console gamer. It's not that I have anything against PC gaming, why would I? It's a preference of personal taste, and my preferred way to game because it fits within my budget and time I choose to dedicate to it. That does not mean that there have not been games I have always wanted to play that were PC only so I guess I missed out on a few.Diablo was always one of those games, until now. Enter in Diablo III. I've read plenty of reviews of the game in anticipation of it's arrival to the PS3 and quite a few of them are from those who have been playing Diablo since the first game. Diablo III for the PC seemed to get a lot of hate, but Blizzard had gone on record saying the console version would not only fix the issues the PC version had at the start (later fixed with patches for the PC), but would also be creating an experience tailor made for console gaming.I'll go on record as saying that Diablo III is the BEST dungeon crawler I have ever played in my life, and that the experience is everything I had hope for and more. I have played every console dungeon crawler in existence since the days of the Dreamcast when Gauntlet Legends was my main staple, so I have some mileage under my belt as to what a dungeon crawler for a console typically is.Everything about this game is perfect. The gameplay style, the engrossing design levels. The heated exchange in battle. The music. Plus just a fantastic multiplayer (that's what it's all about for me). I have no bias since this is my first experience with the franchise, and all I can say to Blizzard is.... give me more.There's no need to repeat all the great things in super detail that other reviewers have mentioned here that are enjoying the game, because they pretty much nailed it. I am just merely throwing my two cents in that if you have never played the PC version of Diablo but were curious about it and are wondering if the reviews that are giving this 5 stars are legit, I am telling you that they are legit. This game smokes and is the best dungeon crawler I have ever played on a console, period.And the reviews that are giving this 1 star? Read them lol. They are all about the same IE: \"Money Grab\", \"Horrible port\", \"Graphics are awful\", etc etc etc. Those 1 star reviews are coming from angry butthurt PC gamers who cannot accept that this version of the game has improved on the short comings that I read about being the issues in the original release of Dialo III on PC. They are also upset because it's no longer an exclusive for PC gaming, and it's the first step in hopefully many more to be taken by Blizzard in bringing some of their fantastic work over to the consoles, or quite possibly designing one that is an exclusive IP for consoles only.Thank you Blizzard for delivering an amazing game. You got a new fan!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}

A real treat!","reviewText":"Diablo 3 is an INSANELY fun game for the PS3. You won't find any of the disadvantages that plagued the PC/Mac versions (auction house and always online for example). So the question strictly comes down to this, do you want a fun action rpg with simplistic and entertaining gameplay? It is simple in the fact that the classes all feel similar to one another, which I think is strictly up to the perspective of the gamer who plays it. I've played quite a few games and found atleast two or three things about them that really bugged me. I can honestly say that I don't experience that with Diablo 3, infact I am greatful that Diablo 3 didn't end up as a game focused on 30-man raids. But I think I must caution players out there to rent the PS3/360 versions if possible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}

The band world tour mode is an absolute blast and the song selection is varied and excellent. I love making bands, personalizing my characters and having so many instrument options. My only complaint is that the equipment is cheap, which is why I gave it an overall rating of 4 instead of 5. I would give it 4 1/2 if that was an option. I've had a guitar and a drum set break and we weren't playing either of the items overly hard. However, customer service was excellent and both items were promptly replaced free of charge. Rock Band is also the game that keeps on giving via its downloadable songs. When we start to get bored of the game we order more songs and we're excited all over again.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"J.

A few things i didn't like were the battle system where you can't make commands to other teammates instead the ai takes control of them so if you want to use lets say vanille's \"death\" spell and you're not controlling her you're out of luck, also when the leader dies it's game over which is just plain stupid. After i beat the game there wasn't much else to do besides the monster side quests which was useless because in order to kill a lot of the monsters you have to grind like crazy and max out all your crystarium for each character which would take forever. Also i didn't like there was no towns like previous final fantasy games, this is what i liked about final fantasy xii were there was multiple towns and people to interact with. So overall i have to give this game 3 out of 5 stars, hopefully final fantasy xiii-2 won't have as many problems as this one did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004QEWVLC","description":"","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Over the top antics delivers just what I needed","reviewText":"After the bombardment of commercials online for this game, I had it on my list to pick up after the price dropped into the $20 range. However, since PlayStation 3 users can get a free copy of Saints Row 2 by picking it up before January or February of next year, and the price at retailers had dropped to $40, I decided to pick up a copy early. And Rooster Teeth's videos on the game influenced me fairly heavily as well.Before I go any further I should note that I've played GTA 3 and Vice City on the PlayStation 2. However, I don't think I ever finished the story of either, since it just didn't work for me, and I generally got bored doing what I felt was the same thing, over and over again. Now I generally play RPGs, so I'm used to grinding, but these two GTA games just didn't match my expectations. I might put Prototype in this grouping as well, for a game of a similar type, that I had a blast playing because of the variety.Note also that this is also my first Saints Row game, but based upon reviews I had previously read, understand that when I play Saints Row 2 I may consider it a step up.Saints Row: The Third is so over the top that my 31+ hours of play (so far - I haven't even touched co-op which looks like a blast) were an absolute joy. To be honest, the humor almost turned me off from picking up the game, but I came in expecting it, and found no issue with it.The variety of side missions (activities) matches this, so I find myself actually challenged by what I need to do, instead of finding the desire to actually start. The story itself might be short, but I personally found it be rather long, as I played these side activities between main story missions. I just finished both endings of the game, after approximately 31 hours, and have approximately 85% of the game complete. Perhaps the story would be over in a few hours if you ran through, but having done this I'd say the story and the rest of the game meld rather well together, and recommend this path.At this point I fully expect that most people have either seen me saying GTA isn't fun, or that I haven't played the previous Saints Row games and assume I'm going to jumping up and down over this game, and have given the review a thumbs down. If you're still reading that suggests to me that you might be like me. If you are, and can overlook a bit of crude humor, I'd say give a few gameplay videos a look and if you like what you see, pick up Saints Row. By the end of the game you'll be so overpowered that you'll rarely even take damage, will never have to reload, and will have infinite ammo for all your weapons. But despite that you'll still have a blast blowing things up, flying around corners with a hostage in the car, and perhaps even starting the story over with a new character, in a co-op (like I'll be doing). And at points you'll probably laugh, and you'll generally be smiling.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

The water and the grass. Everything is detailed to the fullest.  The heat vision looks amazing, and especially movement.  There have been no glitches.Sound:  Sound is well . . . there is music that sometimes play and obviously the object is not to produce sound.  Although you will.  The footsteps, water moving, grass, wind, trains zooming by you, bullets, voices, glass breaking, also the sound of the guy struggling to get out of your grip.  The sounds are spectacular.Gameplay:  Gameplay is the most important aspect of any game.  This game has a very well thought out plot.  With the intro of the terrosits taking over the embassy.  Then you learning of new people that twist in and out of the game. The game is very well created.  Having to stay in the dark, then going into the light because a gaurd has night vision on.  Sneaking behing the guy to grab him and knock him out, but after that you must hide the body so other gaurds won't find him and be suspicious. Gaurds react very well to sounds and movement.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Dubyac99 \"Dubyac99\"","summary":"The Best Videogame System I've ever owned!","reviewText":"This is easily the best videogame playing system I've ever owned!  Although, not a true console, it is a full-fledged gaming system, and that, I believe has always been Sony's intention.  That is to provide a all around gaming system to appeal to all types of gamers.Okay, no, you won't see Grandma or your typical soccer mom toting one of these around, like a walkman, but I honestly don't think that was Sony's intent.  They were always intent on providing the hardcore gamer, such as myself, an outlet, to game on the go!A little bit about myself. I was one one of those guys who actually bought the portable screen and battery for the PSOne.  Yes, that's right I carried my system on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) and played my favorite PSOne games on the go.  I'm also not your typical gamer.  I fall outside of the typical age range (I'm 40), however I am male.  And I'm a business man, not some college student with hours of time on my hands to kill.  In fact, I have fewer hours these days, due to another baby in my house.That's what makes portable gaming so brilliant for me!  I can game when I want to, on my schedule, and on nobody else's!  And when I picked up the PSP, I picked it up, to enjoy all types of media.  And PSP offers it.  I was able to get my music and video watching in with my gaming.  I play very little games these days at home, but I use my PSP at least 1 - 2 hours per day, to and from work, and sometimes on breaks.  I can play virtually any game I have on my PS2, on the PSP, just slightly different versions.  And now I can watch movies on UMD.  And music.  A cinch, downloading from my personal CD's and other online music supply sources.I even listen to Podcasts I download from my favorite radio stations.  No Ipod necessary here.  I got my \"I-PSP.\"  Bangin'!!!!!!!I'm honestly surprised to see everyone keep comparing UMD's to DVD's.  After all, how many times have you seen somebody toting around a portable DVD player on public transportation?  Not more than 5 times I bet.  I pay attention to that kind of thing, and I think I've seen about 5 or so, over the past 10 years.  And laptops are usually being used for computing, rarely watching of movies. But, with many major studios offering most of their movies on UMD, I have a solution.Yes, I know UMD's are falling out of popularity, and Walmart might stop carring them in their retail stores all together, but Amazon carries the highest selection, much more than any other retail or online store I've seen. And so what.  Games will continue to be produced during the normal lifecycle of the PSP.The best videogaming console purchase I have ever made.  'nuff said!MC White said:  Check it out!

The game is fun for maybe 2-3 days but after that the reality begins to sink in that the game is just the same old standard mmo fare of destroy X amounts of ships, than kill Y amount of bad guys on ground or a ship corridor and/or scan Z number of items. This pattern repeats over and over with the same kind of setup in space or a really small instance on the ground. The space combat instances all look the same, the ground maps are really small instances(surrounded by invisible walls) devoid of any life except the bad guys, few small buildings and maybe plants. And to top it off every mission you do involves 4-5 load screens which really gets annoying and dont really give you the feeling of a huge persistent world. The battle-ground style pvp I found fun and is in my view well-done but thats about it and I dont think it merit me paying a monthly sub for the game.I will like to re-emphasize that the missions are highly repititive and are all killing and more killing which might be some alternate version of star trek as even DS9 which was a heavy war-oriented trek series had its fair shair of episodes just on exploration or diplomacy or social issues.The only aspect to look forward in this mmo is getting a new shiny ship every new tier and than rinse and repeat the same kind of missions over and over with only the mobs spieces or the space-ships or the battle scenery changing for the next 10 levels till you hit the lvl cap.

It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"punkviper","summary":"The must-have launch title for Xbox","reviewText":"Half-Life really didn't INVENT the sci-fi first-person shooter, but it sure did succeed at doing it well and popularizing the genre.  The Playstation 2 had their stab at it known as Red Faction (a first-rate game, might I add) and now XBox is boarding the gravy-train with Halo.  And I can safely say, after playing more 1st-person shooters than I care to mention, that Halo is a smashing success, as well as a benchmark by which future progress will be measured.The graphics, though not running at the desired 60 fps, are still enough to make you stop and simply scan around using the right analog stick.  The worlds in this game are awe-inspiring, as well as chock full of landscape objects and detail.  And some of those landscape items make all the difference in the world.  THIS is really where Halo shines, because you no longer need to stand toe-to-toe with an enemy to combat it, nor do you need to play peek-a-boo around walls &amp; corners.  Success at Halo depends on using the terrain &amp; surroundings to your advantage as you progress.  Duck behind a rock, circle around the rock to the nearest tree, sprint across to an indentation in the cliff face, the plethora of objects makes fighting so much more realistic and fun.And it isn't only the terrain that makes it interesting, the enemy AI is extremely logical and doesn't pull the typical &quot;charge right into you at gunpoint&quot; or the &quot;run around without any clue or reason to where I'm going.&quot;  If you duck behing a tree, the opposition fire ceases, but take a peek and expect some fire to come your way.  It's so simple, but rarely has the enemy AI been done this well to the point where it looks like they are following some sort of battle plan.  And that goes for your backup also.  The good guys will fall in behind you, lay down cover fire, strafe from point to point, and generally act like a real combat battalion instead of like simple cannon fodder.  Refreshingly accurate!The only disappointments are a fairly limited roster of enemy unit types, some atrocious control on the jeep-type vehicle, and the fact that often you won't really be informed of exactly what needs to be done next, though the game remains linear enough that aimless roaming does not last too long.The XBox hype machine has been in high gear for this particular game, and rightfully so.  It is certainly the launch title to have for the system (like Soul Calibur was for DC, and SSX for PS2) and is so far THE killer-app for the XBox.  If you are at all inclined towards the 1st-person shooter genre, then by all means this should be at the very top of your must-buy game list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2001"}

The size of the place, the way that the Joker and other inmates are feared, the way the place is buried deep in the nothing of a huge island complex that seems to be infused into solid rock; it goes on and on and on. Then you hear the alarms and see the Joker whirl and know, beyond knowing, that he is loose. It is all a plan and has a bat lodged in the middle of it.From the beginning, the game drags you in. It has a seamless way of doing it, too, and it makes you feel liek the bat. From the combat system to the overall look and feel of everything, you really become the Caped Crusader as he rushes forward to stop the forces of nature housed within Arkham. and it isn't an easy job, either.you have a lot of things you can do here, from using weapons that Batman would use to attacking like the Bat would attack. You have fluid motions and do not have to work hard, and the combos are not hard for the reaction time. you also need that, because the enmies are not forgiving. Sure, you can play on an easy mode if you want, but that becomes dull fter a time. Also, you might want to get all of the extras accomplished in the game, and what a way to do that when you play it on hard. Punishing those baddies - Killer Croc and the lot - feels good when they have some bite.you have the tools of the Batman as well, looking for clues that are left. They can be fingerprints or little things like vices, all leaving signs. You can travel up or down or into the very rockface itself, using ledges and ducts and gargolyes to do it. Sometimes this seems a little bit forced, but the motion is good enough that you forget. Besides, sometime you need to plan to get things or do something. Whether that means you get the mini-missions that are based in clues from the Joker or blowing up walls with Bat-explosives, you work it all out. Its good stuff.Then there are the sides. You have a liot of profiles, statues, clues, tapes, and games. Those games are about stealth, how many baddies oyu can beat down, and so on. Depending on how you play, you can get things you have in the one-man missons and use them here. This means you get power-ups, from fighting to weapons, and you can use them to fight or to take out people with weapons or with other means. Its all good, and its all fun - and good for replay.There is a lot more and a lot to comment on. The one thing that is good here is that this is not Bat exclusive, however, and that anyone can have fun. The game is the call, not the icon, and not playing would be horrible. This is a 5/5 straight, no exclusions and rounding, and deserves a nice home.Thank you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2011"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"vendetta89 \"Greg\"","summary":"Halo 2 goodness","reviewText":"Halo 2 the best FPS on console, no doubt, but it also has the best multiplayer on console as well.

The depth of game play, the level of detail, and of course the fun factor.  The proof is in the pricing.  It has been one year and most still sell Oblivion for the 360 at close to the same price as when it was released.  Very few games can accomplish that.I am a long-time Microsoft fan.  I find most PS3 games ok, but nothing spectacular nor any better than any comparable game on the 360.  Graphically though for Oblivion on the PS3, I must honestly admit it looks a lot more crisp, clearer, and brighter.  I am still using the same TV and using component cables for both systems.  On the 360 with my TV, I found myself needing to increase the brightness all the time just to see certain areas well enough even with a torch lit.  It is perfect on the PS3 without any adjustments.Load times are faster overall.  You still wait here and there, but not nearly as long as on the 360.  It is missing many of the downloads you could get on the 360 for a small fee.  A couple of those I really miss.  I still think the Xbox 360 controllers are much better to use than the Sony ones, so that is one flaw I do not like dealing with.So yes, same game on a different system and I bought it again.  This game has entertained me for hundreds of hours and hopefully even hundreds more.  If you have not played it, there are many characters to choose from and during the game, you can of course choose a heroic path to an insanely evil path.  You just have to be good enough not to get caught when being evil.Now maybe if they did it on the Wii with that remote, that would be interesting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2007"}

The map is massive and contains a slew of different environments.  The stronghold missions are still repetitive and boring but thankfully there's only a handful of them this time around, and I didn't mind doing them since they unlocked more side missions, which are usually enjoyable.  The one issue the developers still haven't perfected is the combat.  It's fun, and doesn't detract from the game, but you still get the feeling it could have been tightened up a bit.  Also, they must do a lot of skeet shooting on Panau because I lost track of how many times I've been shot flying through the air with my grappling hook or while I was in complete free-fall.Still, the game is such a blast that these rare annoyances are hardly a complaint.

If you like anything that has to do with the Old West, you'll love this game.Let me tell you something.  This has got one of the best looking video game engines I have ever seen for a PlayStation 3 video game.  The game developer is called Techland and the video game engine they use to build this game is called the Chrome Engine 4.  The outdoor scenes especially toward the middle of the game are just spectacular.  I honestly went exploring around on some maps just to look at the scenery.  Some of the maps are sandbox (Free Worlds) and these Free World maps are huge and you can go anywhere on these maps to explore.  I love mounting a horse and just riding around looking at things.  I live in Utah and the outdoor scenes in the Southwest United States in the game are just like they are in real life with the beautiful canyons and mountains scenes.  The streams and rivers and waterfalls look like they have real water flowing through them.Okay as far as the story goes to this game, I think the story line is pretty good.  There are two main characters mentioned throughout the game that are brothers. The oldest brother is called Ray McCall and the younger brother is called Thomas McCall.  What most reviews to this game fail to mention is that there is a third brother in the game who is the youngest brother. His name is William.  He doesn't carry a gun since he is more like a preacher who preaches about God and carries the Bible around with him. He goes pretty much where ever the other two brothers go within the game.  Now the game starts out with the two older McCall brothers, Ray and Thomas, fighting in Georgia for the Confederacy against the Union during the Civil War.  The two oldest brothers end up deserting the Confederate Army to go and defend their home against Union Soldiers.  William is with their mother trying to defend their home already.  They end up losing their home and William decides to goes with Ray and Thomas out West to look for the \"Lost Treasure of Cortez\" that is located some where down in Mexico where they can regain their fortune.Basically the game from there is all about going through Mexico and Arizona.  You meet Mexican bandits, different Indian tribes, lawmen, outlaws, gunslingers, ex- confederate soldiers, civilians, etc.  You help and fight different people throughout the game.  You have a choice of different weapons to fight with.  You can use different kind of revolvers and rifles to fight with.  Usually at the end of each mission throughout the game, you end up fighting the main bad guy in an old fashion gunfight where you draw pistols at each other.  When you end up killing the main bad guy in the gunfight, you advance further along in the game.There is a lot of replay value in this game especially on the Free World maps.  I understand that Techland is going to add more maps to the game later on.  I hope that if Techland does add more maps to the game that they are all Free World maps.  I love them kind of maps to ride around on a horse to explore.  I highly recommend people to go out and buy the game to add to their collection of video games just so they'll have a Western game to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2009"}

I couldn't believe the low price.  The only other WWII shooter I've played (up to this point) is Battlefield 1942.  That game was fun but totally unrelated to reality. (e.g. You're a medic carrying a submachine gun, come upon a German tank, jump in, can drive, load, aim and fire all by yourself, etc. - fun but silly)I don't know how many of you are old enough to have watched the old tv show Combat with Vic Morrow but that is what I was reminded of when playing this game.The ability to command a squad broken into several teams makes this much more realistic for single player.  Several reviewers have complained about the games's aiming/firing functions.  To me that was one of the best features.  There are no magic crosshairs which appear - you have the actual sights of whatever weapon you are using.  The unsteadiness of aiming is again more realistic than in other games.Remember, you have been running, are breathing hard, plus people are shooting at you.The game was very stable and the graphics are fine.  Even the box and manual were well done.  The developers really paid attention to detail.Suggestions to designers:  How about a boot camp were you could practice firing some of the weapons to get a feel for them at different ranges?  I love RPG's and would love to see you take the basic systems from this game and design a RPG style game.  Instead of quests create randomly generated missions.  Individuals from the squad would get better with experience.  (but those killed would be replaced by new characters - usually green recruits)  You could see how many of the original squad could make it through say 25 missions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

You can now record sounds and take photos - both front and back - with your DS! On the downside, it only plays DS games - it cannot play old style games.Nintendo DSi Review Rather than giving you a lot of cold statistics that you can find on the many marketing sites out there, let me instead give you my actual, personal observations after playing and using this DS. We have owned pretty much every version of a Nintendo handheld that has come out over the years and avidly enjoy them. This Nintendo DSi is definitely a worthy successor to this line.For players of older games, it's important to note the DSi only plays DS style games, not any older games. That is quite fine by me. There are a TON of DS games out at this point and many older games are compiled onto DS format. If you really want to play an older style game, get one of those older style units. The units are very cheap at this point. The focus of the DSi on only DS games means it is light, thin, and very easy to use.The DSi has TWO cameras - one facing forwards, one facing backwards. This means you can easily take photos of yourself and friends! We had a ton of fun taking photos of each other, of our pets, and using all of their morphing and kaleidoscope features to make great images out of them. You can save the images to a SD card for use on your computer and printing out.I love the microphone tools. You can record 10 second blurbs and add harmonies, raise or lower the pitch, and do other operations on them. This is a lot of fun as well.The unit comes to you pre-charged which is awesome. It means you can start playing games the moment you get it. Instant gratification is a good thing!The image size is great, larger than previous DS units. The audio quality is great as well! This really is an awesome handheld gaming unit for all of the latest generation games. I'm really enjoying their easy to use interface, and looking forward to all of the games I'll be able to download wirelessly.It's important to note that the DSi uses a different type of charger than the original DS, so the two aren't interchangeable. The DSi of course comes with its own charger so you don't have to worry about buying one. It also comes with an extra stylus.I am really enjoying the DSi. You might say \"it's only a little brighter, only a little larger, only a little lighter.\" However, when you're talking about a tiny unit that fits on your hand, it is often those tiny improvements that make a huge difference. The small lightness boost makes it easier to hold and carry in a full purse. The brightness and better sound give that much more fun to the gaming experience.While some might scoff at the microphone and camera, both are great fun. The higher quality sound means I can actually now use this as a MP3 player! It uses AAC format. This is a standard format and there are free converters out there if you tend to use MP3 or other formats.To summarize, I love this unit. If you don't have any DS unit I would definitely get this one rather than one of the previous DS units. If you already have a DS or DS Lite I'd recommend giving those to a younger sibling or friend, and getting a new DSi for yourself. The added playability and abilities definitely makes it a must-have for me.Please let me know if you have any questions about the DSi!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Frederick M. Segrest","summary":"A classic.","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank is incredibly well-done in every respect. The characters and concepts are hilarious, creative, and off-the wall.

The game takes place across the first two films, in, of course, Middle Earth.  You can take take the place of Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli.  All of which have their ups and downs.  Legolas is the weakest character, but the fastest, utilizing his two daggers and bow.  Gimli, being quite slow, is a beastly tank wielding a battle-axe and smaller axes for throwing.  Aragorn lies right in the middle of the two.  He uses a sword and bow.  The graphics in this game are superb, everything from the character models to the tree leaves.  All the characters look almost exactly like their movie counter-parts, with the exception of Gimli.  He doesn't look right, his face looks squintish and pushed in...  The levels themselves have a substantial amount of detail and lighting.  For instance, in the level \"Balin's Tomb\" where you get the cave troll, the beam of light that shines upon the stone casket looks amazing.  The levels are very closely related to the movies (well I can only tell that by looking at the first film for the second is not out yet) and I instantly recognized them.  Cutscenes from the movies are integrated throughout the levels.  This includes a large amount of clips from LOTR: The Two Towers.  The gameplay is also very fun and has one of the best \"archery systems\" I've seen.  Music from the movies is incorporated throughout the game as well.  Also packed with the game are a lot of special features (like those from a DVD) including \"the making of...\" and character interviews.  All in all, this is an excellent game and I recommend it to any action or Tolkien fan. Killing the goblis/orcs/uruk-hai, is a blast, so buy this game.

While it may sound corny, the truth is I really was attracted to this game out of curiosity.  It was heavily advertised on the internet, and it received many high ratings and praises on many websites.  So, what makes this game so special?  I shall bring you the inside scoop with a grading system.  A+ will be the highest, and F- will be the lowest.  Shall we begin?Storyline, A: A simple, yet at the same time intricate, plot.  Professor Layton and his assistant, Luke, have been summoned by the Lady Dahlia of St. Mystere.  Apparently, Baron Augustus Reinhold has recently died; and his will states that he will leave his fortune and estate to whomever finds his golden apple.  That ends the simplicity of it.  While your main job is to find the golden apple, many mysteries tangle themselves within your search.  In order to find out anything about the golden apple or the other mysteries, you have to coax the citizens into giving you clues; you do that by solving the complex puzzles they give you.  If there ever was a language of puzzles, the citizens of St. Mystere speak it; it's how you earn knowledge of what they know, as well as their trust.  A mysterious tower, dubious people and happenings, as well as the mystery of the Baron's own family, are just some of the things you will face.Graphics, A: This game is most certainly attractive to the eye. The anime graphics kind of look like fine watercolor paintings.Music/Sound, A: The music is good, but slightly repetitious.  The sound effects are great, especially when you include the voices to the mix.  The voices of Professor Layton and Luke are great and it really sells their personalities.Characters, A+: The characters are well developed.  There are a lot of characters, and you'll learn everything about all of them.  With such various personalities, you'll never be bored with the citizens.  Layton and Luke are both lovable, and have their own charms and quirks.Puzzles/Bonus Features, A: The puzzles are challenging and various.  Most of them don't really have anything to do with the story, but rather are randomly thought up by the civilians.  You will see common themes, however, and some puzzles can pertain to situations.  If you can complete the game once, you have many great bonus features in store.  You can look at art and movies from the game, you can learn more about the people of St. Mystere, and listen to the voices and music.  The one thing that bothers me about the Top Secret features is that there is a door that needs a password.  This password won't be revealed until the next game, which is a rather cheap shot to attract customers, in my opinion.  In addition to the puzzles in the story and the houses (Artist Lover's house and Inventors house, for example) you can get more puzzles via Wi-Fi.  Needless to say if you don't have Wi-Fi, this doesn't apply to you...Overall, A+: Awesome game.  It was the very first game I didn't have to beg my mother to look at.  She was interested in what I was doing in my gaming for once; and she looked on her own curiosity.  In order for me to recommend this for a child, the child has to be persistent and patient in nature.  The puzzles can be hard and if one isn't determined, the game can be easy to walk away from.  I can definitely recommend this to teenagers and adults who love puzzles.  This game is also very educational, as you'll learn about the history behind some of the puzzles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2008"}

After awhile of playing my DS and Wii, I thought I'd give in and get a PSP as well and many games were suggested or looked intriguing but familiarity and a good price brought me to Liberty City Stories. While the content isn't exactly for all ages, LCS shows what exactly Sony's tiny machine can pull off and aside from a few hiccups, this is a great game to check out for recent PSP purchasers or longtime owners - provided you're old enough for this of course.Story: Taking place in 1998, 3 years before the original Grand Theft Auto III, Tony Cipriani as just arrived to Liberty City after laying low from killing a \"made man\" which is a big mafia no-no. But his absence has left others taking over what he had so Tony has to rise up again in the ranks and take on various tasks to be where he used to be or maybe even further.Graphics: Despite its smaller system, the PSP always looked like it could handle more complex games like God of War or Crisis Core and while graphically LCS doesn't impress on a aesthetic level, the fact it's even on this system with all 3 islands (Portland Island, Staunton Island and Shoreside Vale), the streets and the exact map layout of each. As for how the game looks, the GTA series has never really had an attractive look and on the PSP, it's a bit more forgiveable.Sound/Music: The GTA series has always had great voice acting and in this one, there's a few notable roles that work well while others just don't really fit and lack a certain something. Tony for example doesn't really have the drive of Tommy or the care of CJ (yes I said care), this guy just feels more \"angry mode\" than anything. The music comes from the radio stations when you're on a vehicle and I never did like GTA3's radio stations and often listened to the Chatterbox though in some cases on a more intense mission, I had big operatic orchestral music on like Double Clef FM.Gameplay: III started the whole \"open-ended gameplay\" that many have been copying which allow you to traverse the city and do whatever you feel like. That's here as well from taxi and vigilante missions to the main stories, or just doing insane jumps and finding hidden packages, completists could have a ball with this one. The main story missions are the same as always: pick someone up and drop em off and/or shake off cops, blow up something or go on assassin sprees where you have to off someone. The problem comes in the narrative where there was always a drive to the missions but since the story wasn't that intriguing, the missions felt more like tasks to do or errands.Controlling on the PSP did feel different since I was so used to the Dual Shock and the analog gets the job done although sometimes it was too finicky with me trying to correct myself and the lack of a good camera control doesn't help. Pushing the L shoulder and moving the analog allows a rotating camera but it always felt awkward. The other notable problem is the targeting system where it's way too easy to target civilians or others instead of the guy you want and enabling the free-aim by pressing the down button felt sluggish and it's best to just reposition. Other than that, the game still controls the same, although you can't swim (poo).If you're old enough and were a fan of the game, it's a good idea to check out Liberty City Stories. It's not quite the best in the series or the worst but it's worth looking into it anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2008"}

Donnelly","summary":"What a long journey it's been...","reviewText":"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.  Where do I begin?  And where do I end?  The beauty of it is that while I may begin and end at the same place, the journey there can vary endlessly.Having never played any other Elder Scrolls games, I cannot judge how much of an upgrade or advancement this is from Oblivion and Morrowind.  I cannot tell you how the combat system is different, or how much prettier this game is relative to the previous ones.What I can tell you is that this is a fantastic game, admittedly with some issues, that is worth a look from anyone interested in a huge, immersive world, an arching storyline, endless sidequests, and quite simply a good time.I can't say much that hasn't already been said, unfortunately.  The game is beautiful.  The graphics are very good--they may not be the best I've seen, but taking a step back and looking at a gorgeous landscape on high quality, I find it hard to believe you wouldn't at least be somewhat impressed.  (Unless you wouldn't marvel at the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls, in real life.  In which case, I doubt much impresses you visually)The world is massive, and alive.  There are plenty of people to interact with.  Some will ask you to do a series of deep quests that have nothing to do with the main storyline.  Others will be of no use to you at all.  Quite simply, it's like a real world.  People run out of money.  People try to leverage you for their will. (sometimes against each other)  You will make choices.  Some will matter, some won't be too relevant.You could finish the storyline quickly, and enjoy the game.  To get the most out of it, it's a good idea to explore the world.  See more of it, and interact with more NPCs.Leveling up in this game isn't the same as in a standard RPG.  You have a character level, but your skills also have their own individual levels.  Leveling your skills up contributes to leveling your character up, which gives you points to assign to skill bonuses, as well as an increase health, magic, or stamina.  This makes leveling much less of a grind, because your character level itself doesn't offer as much benefit as in most games.  You increase your skill levels simply by using them--forging bracers increases your smithing skill, and blocking attacks with your shield increases your blocking skill, for instance.The combat is less than stellar.  It's something I still don't particularly enjoy--it feels a bit rigid and restrained, sometimes even awkward.  Swings of your sword just don't feel as satisfying as I'd like, and switching weapons during combat is hindered by some awkward controls, as well.  Character controls overall are acceptable, but could use some improvement.  If you get past the combat (which is admittedly a large part of gameplay, for most people), then the rest of the game can truly shine.The most apparent shortcoming of this game, as many will tell you, is its menu system.  It was created for a controller rather than a keyboard/mouse, which is quite apparent the entire time.  Questionable decisions were made in many ways--the amount of space to dedicate to the image vs the item text/description, the number of items that can be seen at the same time, lack of proper sorting, and various other problems plague menus throughout the game.  Navigating through the perk assignment screen when you level up is atrocious, as well.  There are times when pressing up/down/left/right (w/a/s/d) will simply not go to the next logical item on this menu.  This may not make sense, but the perk assignment menus are shaped like constellation, so the next perk may be diagonally up/right, but sometime neither up nor right will actually select the next perk--instead they will skip it or move to the next tree of skills.  It is confusing and makes absolutely no sense.  Visually appealing?  Maybe.  But it's about as intuitive as the game ET was for the Atari 2600. (Read: not even the least bit)Overall, while the menus are a big part of the game, they do not break the experience.  The PC version of Skyrim has an advantage, of being moddable.  Mods have already been created to modify the UI a bit.  I have not tried any of these mods yet--my experience has only been with the original product as released by Bethesda.  Still, I have to say this is one of the more appealing games of 2011.  The world can just suck you in.  On a day where I didn't have any specific plans, I spent hours without even realizing it, barely looking up except to get a drink or use the bathroom.  It is an excellent game, and while there are some significant flaws, it should not be completely overlooked based on these flaws--the overall product shines through, once you learn your way around the menus, combat, and the game world.I strongly encourage anyone who has a PC, 360, or PS3 to check this one out.  The PC has the advantage of being moddable, but the title is likely to impress regardless of which system you play it on, as long as you give it enough time to pick up its pace.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

C. Obraztsov","summary":"A little repetitive - but the series gets better.","reviewText":"I actually originally first bought Assassin's Creed II because of the poor and disappointing reviews I read on this one.  Well, I have to mostly agree with what I've read.  After backtracking from the second game to this one, there is no comparison.  The second game moves more fluidly, much better controls, and is a little less repetitive.On the bright side, the story is very interesting and there are some major twists.  When I played AC2 before 1, I was totally confused what was going on.  If you are really interested in the entire story, then obviously you should start here. Both game are filled with interesting pieces of historical info.  But I found it to be quite of a chore.  If you don't care as much about the storyline, you could just skip to the second one.Also, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that there are no subtitles.  I am a little hard of hearing, and this game has no subtitles!  I don't know the last time I played a fairly recent dialogue-intensive game with no subtitles at all.  Very disappointed with that part!  Not a bad game, but don't feel bad if you skip it to get to the better ones of the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2012"}

I didn't imagine that is was going to be this much fun for me as well. This game requires the Kinect Sensor (hooked to your Xbox 360) in order to play.Gameplay: You are on an island and you have control of 1 of 5 cubs to explore with. Your controls are all done with your body using your legs, arms, head and body. The initial cubs are a Cheetah, Royal Bengal Tiger, Black Panther, African Lion, and African Leopard. Throughout the game, you can unlock several more cubs including a Sabertooth Tiger, Siberian Tiger, white Jaguar, Bobcat, Serval, Bornean Clouded Leopard, and a few more rare Tigers. You have a flying guided creature with you that is basically your MC. He gives you options of what you want to do next. You have a meter that ranges from 1 to 5 at the top of your screen. Whatever activity you are doing with your cub (tossing a ball, cleaning them, digging up treasures, shooting a sprayer at targets, driving a remote control, and tons more) your meter moves up. When you get to the next number, a new activity starts. When you get to 5, it is usually a final event. As you progress through the game, new areas are opened up and new activities as well. You get a new cub with each area.Conclusion: The controls are very good. When kicking or throwing an object, you will get a feel for how fast your movements can be with the sensor. Once you figure that out, it works great. The graphics are excellent. My 4-year-old can play this no problem but does need some help on some tougher challenges. Great game for the Kinect. It takes a lot of playing to fully explore the island. The animals are fun. Worth getting for the Kinect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

Mario Kart 64 was hella better. Mario Kart Double Dash takes the game to a whole new level.This game is somewhat in the vein of Super Smash Bros.

You actually have to really consider who you pick, because everyone has their own strengths, and special items.IGN originally trashed the game because they thought the demo was too slow. That's not the case here. All of the courses are really tight, but I remind you that this is not just a single-player game. This was made with multiplayer purposes in mind, case in point, the LAN support. It never gets dull with at least one other person around.Overall, I loved it.

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system.

It's a game with a lot of well-implemented concepts and the rare original that deserves a sequel.  But every time I turned the game off, my mind kept reanalyzing what wasn't so good about \"Infamous\".  How can such a fun ride with the controller in my hand get such criticisms when I'm not playing it?\"InFamous\" is a story that belongs right in a comic book, as our superhero/supervillain Cole delivers a package that suddenly explodes into a devastating electrical bomb.  Some people are altered by the explosion's energy, but everyone is affected by it.  The metropolitan Empire City is in shambles.  The government won't save the people.  The police can't save the peoople.  The criminals are free to ravage the city.  But soon into our story, Cole is contracted by the CIA to use his powers to restore the city and prevent the deadly RaySphere from falling into the wrong hands.I've described Cole as a superhero AND supervillain because you get to choose whether he's a savior or menace to society.  Your actions will be gauged and scored, and the new electrical powers you acquire will depend on whether you use your powers for good or evil.  This may seem like a gimmick, but as the game progresses, you notice subtle changes in Empire City.  Being a good hero will have citizens take pictures of you, hang banners of you, and keep the streets a little cleaner.  However, should you become a dastardly villain, people will either fear you or show the utmost disrespect for you.  I call these subtle changes because the only way to really notice them is to play the game both times.  You might not be very impressed with how your moral choices affect the city until you see the other side of the coin.  That's not exactly a 'problem', because \"InFamous\" is well worth playing a second time.  But since the story is almost the same either way, your first playthrough might not impress on that Game-of-the-Year level.\"InFamous\" is an open-world game, which means you are free to roam the city as you please, and take on the missions at your own pace.  There isn't a whole lot to do besides the story levels and side quests, but the high number of both will ensure you play \"InFamous\" for a good while.  Although there are a lot of 'categories' for these missions, they all boil down to taking down your enemies, finding/activating an object, and occasionally keeping a person or vehicle safe.  In other words, although your reasons for the missions will change, how you deal with the problem remains the same.  You will pretty much have to climb buildings, fight your foes, and may be asked to push the Triangle button on an object.  Rinse.  Repeat.The weird thing is that \"InFamous\" asks you to basically do the same things over and over again, yet it never gets old.  It only really got on my nerves when I turned off the game and started to reflect.  I think my issues with the mission variety wouldn't be so bad if the game had a stronger presentation.  Aside from the comicbook-style cutscenes and electrical power effects, this game feels like it belongs on an X-Box or PS2.  I'm guessing that the PS3 is used to maintain quick loadtimes and smooth framerates.  If that's the case, thank God for the PS3.  But some of the in-game cinematics and animations look pretty poor.  I used to lower the bar for open-world games in terms of graphics, but ever since \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" put that notion to rest in summer 2008, I expect a 2009 videogame to offer the same level of detail.  Perhaps if \"InFamous\" looked as sharp as other PS3-exclusives, I wouldn't complain so much.However, the controls are as smooth as can be.  Cole can climb every building in the city, fall from great heights and feel no pain, and can use the city's eletricity to restore his power.  Eventually, you gain new transportation abilities, like skating on power lines, standing atop a moving train, and hovering in the sky.  The only complaint here is that hovering isn't as tight as it could be, because it's hard to steer if you're already moving ahead at great velocity.  However, I suppose that's realistic, in a superhero world anyway.  And even though I'm tired of regenerative health systems --- meaning you have no life bar, but must keep out of danger if you're hurt to heal --- it makes sense in the world of \"InFamous\".  Cole may be more than a human, but he's not a god.The story is good enough, and narrowly avoids what could've been annoying traits.  Your foolish best friend/sidekick is more silly than aggravating, a strong feat since he makes some stupid choices.  The estranged girlfriend isn't fully explored, but in the chaotic Empire City, both Trish and Cole have more urgent matters at hand.  You receive your orders and missions through radio chatter (like \"BioShock\" or \"Dead Space\"), but since Cole actually speaks his mind and has a soul, it's the right balance of being used by a higher power and reacting to the circumstances around you.  The anarchist villains might not be developed enough, because there's a strong attachment to Empire City, it's enough for your greed/heroism to challenge the attackers.  However, there is a great plot twist I doubt anybody will see coming.  Finally, we've been promised that in the upcoming \"InFamous 2\" goes, we've your old saves will impact the sequel's storyline.Hardcore gamers like to use the saying, \"If the gameplay is good, then who cares about the graphics?\"  In the case of \"InFamous\", they're absolutely right.  The game is an entertaining blast from start to finish, and I couldn't wait to play it to the end, and I had just as much fun on my 2nd playthrough to be an evil force in Empire City.  However, considering how good other PS3 games looked, I expected more.  It's a good-looking game, but feels like it's only on PS3 to have shorter load times and smoother framerates.  I realize those are strange criticisms, but think of it this way: It's the perfect opportunity for \"InFamous 2\" to make an even better sequel.  So many original games get sequels that can't possibly outdo their first outings; \"InFamous\" is one of those franchises that can get better and better.  The pieces are in place.  The story is open for more exploration.  The superpowers are a blast to use.  It's time for Sucker Punch Studios to take this very good first chapter and make this franchise into a force to be reckoned with.The best compliment I can give \"InFamous\" is that I never hated playing the game, and I can't wait for the sequel.  It's rare that we crave the next chapter after playing through a good story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2010"}

The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city. Players will be challenged to decide if they choose to save or destroy Empire City.Urban Exploration- Scale the cityscape to discover new vantage points and employ a vertical combat system. Utilize Cole&rsquo;s climbing skills to go where most people can not, opening up a variety of offensive and defensive combat options.Organic City Ecology- Watch the citizens and city react and evolve depending on players&rsquo; actions. Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Better than anticipated","reviewText":"I had a feeling this game would be fun; but I had no idea I would like it this much! I am normally a sports game fan and I needed something to hold me over until Madden 10 comes out. I saw a trailer on Infamous and I figured I would give it a shot after playing the demo. I really like how Cole has super powers and does not rely on guns to kill the enemy. If I'm gonna play a non sports game, I want to see some crazy stuff that I can't see in real life and Infamous delivers. It's basically two games in one because you can choose to become \"good\" or \"evil\" based on your actions. I also like how it has three difficulty levels so it will never be too hard or too easy for anyone. If you are thinking about getting it. Get it!

The PSP 3000 came out in 2008 and is the third and latest version of the PSP. I think that by now you should know what to expect, after all it's the same PSP with a few changes. This one is even lighter and brighter than the original and the 2000, it has an improved LCD screen (I wouldn't worry too much about the scan lines). It now has a microphone (which I've never used as of now), a longer battery life it also feels great in my hands which is great. It comes in different colors; piano black, silver, purple and white (there are also limited edition ones as well and some with designs on them). There are also many packages to choose from, maybe you just want the core to replace your current PSP or you may want to buy the Ratchet and Clank package or perhaps the Assassin's Creed one.So is it worth buying a PSP 3000 right now? Yes. There are some goods games available like Final Fantasy Crisis Core, God of War and there are still good games coming out for the system. The games don't cost that much either they are priced reasonably, you can buy a brand new one for about 40$ and \"Greatest Hits\" games are under 20$. It does a lot of things for a portable console, including networking. You may want to consider buying a bigger memory stick card if you plan on playing many games and having many files on your PSP. Don't worry about the PSP Go, I know there are some concerns but it's a different console and Sony aren't planning to replace the PSP with it, it's entirely different and if you aren't comfortable with the fact that you don't have physical copies of the game (you buy games online) you should rather get this one or an older version of the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

Then comes MUA 2. The graphics really haven't improved much, and aside from a slightly different story line not much has changed. I did appreciate the ability to choose registration/anti-registration sides at first, but even this doesn't do enough to differentiate from the first game. I know these programmers have a formula that worked for them with the original, and that they don't want to mess with it too much.

{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"Daniel V.","summary":"A must-have for any PS2 owner period!","reviewText":"Without this memory card there is no fun.

Featuring nine distinct roles Heavy, Spy, Scout, Demoman, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Soldier, and Pyro Team Fortress 2 is one of this year&#146;s most anticipated multiplayer games for any platform.","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"No Title","reviewText":"Valve has made itself distinct in the PC world of gaming. We've all played through at least one session of Gordon Freeman clobbering some headcrab, have fond memoriories of a killer game of Team Fortress, and each time we see the fat man with the knob on his dome, we recognize how much skill Valve has. But Valve take the easy way out, by making the Orange Box a smourgasboard of games, but small ones.The Orange Box is a great game deal, there's no denying that; the entire Half Life 2 collection with the 2nd sequal, the much innovative, mind-blowing Portal, and one of the origonal class-based multiplayers, Team Fortress 2. While there is 5 games total, the only true full game is the origonal Half Life 2. Both sequals are just episodes(half a game), not a full fledged 20+hr game, which goes the same for Portal, Valve's interpetation of a test lab rat. Among all the gold(or orange) in the Box, Portal truly is a diamond, by circling around a wormhole-generator gun as the main gameplay mechanic, using it to solve puzzles for a appliance company. Seems simple enough, but innovation is just breaking into games now(outside Nintendo). Portal is enjoyable enough, fun enough, and brillant enough to stand on it's own two feet, but Valve gives it 4 support beams to fall back on, channling the Box as a pilot game to lauch a hopefull franchise.After hitting the snooze button for 10 years, Valve woke up to the fans call of a 2nd edition of Team Fortress. Instead of following the sequal norm of an upgraded graphic engine, Valve rehauls the whole look, flip-flopping over to a Pixar-type look, Incredibles, if I had to call one out, but ramped up violence/blood is what slappes the M on the box more than anything. Valve keeps one eye on TF2 online, now giving patches and updates for the unpopular clases, which keeps gameplay fresh and stops Valve from pumping out another full fledged game. Team Fortress has a great online community, but thats just it. It's ALL online, nothing else. No offline services, which isen't to bad, but when fans get love affairs for certain maps, the play-feild gets real stale.Even though Valve gave us 5 games(4shorties) it's has all the makings for the perfect game sequal: a strong foundation to build off of(Half-Life 2), fresh new ideas, while still keeping to it's roots(Episodes 1 and 2, Portal), plus, a killer multiplayer function(Team Fortress 2). Valve put all of the ideas in the same box, but just put barriars between them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2008"}

I can only comment on the 3 main games as of now since I haven't checked out the bonus content or the mini games yet and waiting till I have finished and satisfied with the 3 main releases in this collection.Flower: An absolute joy to play. It has been decades since I played a game and found myself smiling and actually feeling happy playing it. It's such a simple game with no spoken dialogue, no words, no context given or anything. You use one button essentially, have the visuals and music throughout the game and nothing more. I found something akin back to a Disney movie of sorts about good and evil that is told so subtly that its mind boggling as to how they told a story that is barely there using so little and having such an effect on me. I played the game twice and had just as much fun the second time. Its a very soothing game, very peaceful and yet instills a sense of dread at certain points.Journey: Like so many others, it made me cry at the end. I can't explain why or how but I just felt a surge of happiness that it made me tear up right at the last section of the game. Again it told this story using very little at all beyond just images and interpretation. Although this game seemed to have more story to it. Sadly I can't go into details without spoiling anything, but once you play it you will see what I mean. Wonder, happiness, sadness, danger, loneliness and excitement were feelings I had when playing this game. I played it twice but I'm holding off as I don't want to overdue, this will be a game I come back to again soon but I don't want to wear out its welcome.Flow: Not a terrible game but just not something I enjoyed. It was fun, interesting and different. But it just felt unfinished and the controls left something to be desired. I didn't hate it by any means but it just didn't resound with me the way the other 2 games did. This was also their first game so growing pains are to be expected and you can definitely see they made a huge leap in their skills when making flower and further polishing themselves with journey.All in all I can't recommend this collection enough. For 30 bucks purchasing it new shouldn't be a problem because I got more out of these for 30 bucks than I have spending 500 bucks on big name games from the past 2 or 3 years. I reminded me of why I love games like I did when I was a kid instead of just spending 60 bucks on brand x AAA title of the month and going through the motions only to finish it and forgetting most of what I just played.

While you do control grenades and knife swipes with the screen it doesn't always feel awkward though every now again if you aren't careful, you can accidentally hit the wrong thing but it's not game breaking so far.Graphics - Not bad but in some of the modes particularly hostiles, you feel as if they could have used different varieties and models of enemies on screen. As one other person stated and they are correct, some levels are indeed dark and you may miss a target if you aren't looking.Campaign mode - it's what it is, Black Ops missions.  Whether you are escaping an exploding building or freeing prisoners, what you are getting is a bite sized mission to play as you go.Gripes - So far not many, I do feel sometimes that even when dishing out headshots you have to almost unload your weapon in a target to make it stay down as headshots don't always do the trick. Furthermore, I hate the fact that during some missions, just when you get close to the end, if you die, you have to start completely over.  Saved checkpoints would have done well here to keep the game moving without starting an entire level over again.  Also, I am not all that crazy about the idea that some ops have a timer to them that you have to frantically go about to complete. And  while I do like the Hostiles mode, I do wish there was a way to get a larger variety of weapons in the course of some of the stages.  I also wished that some of the MP modes from the console game made it over to the Vita but as they say you have to crawl before you can run.Anyone that is a COD fan and an FPS fan who has been looking for a good shooter since Unit 13 finally has their wish. It's just enough here to keep you going while on the go and then there is the added extra bonus of getting CoD: Road to Victory for free that makes this package a good deal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"SRS47","summary":"Why so many 1 start?!","reviewText":"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Resident Evil series. I played RE1,2,3,4,5,6 +ORC. However, when I played RE6's demo, I was shocked. I hated it so much that I didn't buy the game till few days ago because now it's cheaper. Boy, I was wrong... This game is really good. It's totally different from RE 1-5 but it's really epic. Story is not really a big part of the game, but it's interesting enough to make me finish all 4 campaigns.GOOD:-Perfect shooting experience-Good sound effects and dialogs-Good graphic-Perfect Co-op experience-Good choice of weapons( Dual Gun for Leon!! COOL )-Really smooth control and movement( I can slide and get a head shot with shotgun, HELL YE!! )Bad-Little boring-Developers were ran out of idea and just made really long and boring levels.-Weapon upgrades are gone, but not totally. Now you can upgrade your fire power, accuracy, recoil,... but with one simple upgrade for all weapons. Now you can only have 3 upgrades with you in a game. For example, I choose to have 1. Infiniti Handgun ammo 2. More fire power, 3. Less recoil. However, there are 8 of these 3 choices. You can switch easily. But it has to be 3 at a time. Not that bad, but I liked the old one better which you could upgrade every single gun.As far as level design go, looks like developers didn't spend much time on itLeon: Very fun and old school RE style. It gets little boring in the middle, but fun.Cheris: I hated it. It's like playing Call Of duty in 3rd person. No zombies, just like the last 3 levels of RE5.Jake: Cool, fun, tactical, stealth, and awesome. There are some levels that you need to sneak around and not get detected.Ada: In one word, PURE FUN.After you are done with the main story you can play mercenaries which is really fun. Endless zombie attacks and combos makes it really fun. Or you can play as a zombie in Agent hunt mode. Good in theory, but really bad in reality.Anyway, I finished the game in like 15-17 hours. I can't say I enjoyed every part of it, but mostly it was fun and interesting. Please note, it is NOT like old RE series what so ever. It's combination of Raccoon City and RE5. More action than zombie surviving. The only reason I wrote a review is that I really want people to give this a try, stop hating this game. It doesn't deserve 4.5/10 nor 10/10, but it's a fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Impressively huge with solid combat, but weak writing lets down the game","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins is BioWare's reflective look at their own origin (so to speak). It's a big, broad, swords and sorcery epic meant to evoke memories of the Baldur's Gate series, where BioWare got started in RPGs. It's also in 3D, with streamlined controls, inventory management and in-engine cut-scenes. It's BioWare's attempt to blend their original, more hardcore RPGs with their later, stripped-back and more cinematic games like the Mass Effect series. It's a game that tries to balance the old with the new and does not quite succeed.Which is not to say it doesn't have a go. The game is huge, taking upwards of 50 hours to complete. Cleverly, the game reorganises its opening two hour prologue based on your race and class: a dwaven noble starts in a separate location to a human mage, with a totally different cast of supporting characters, enemies and opening quests. The fact that you can replay the game several times and get a different opening, with the various versions not aligning until you reach Ostagar, is quite clever and rewards replaying the game. Indeed, the choices in these sections reverberate throughout the whole game, with your eventual return to your starting location allowing you to address unfinished business. It's the game's main selling point and is something that is handled very well, making it all the more bemusing that the concept was completely chucked out the window for the two sequels.As is traditional with BioWare games, your main character is fully customisable but the supporting cast are set in stone. You can accumulate up to ten companion characters throughout the course of the game and take three of them with you on missions. Your inactive party members hang out at a campsite you can periodically visit to exchange information, form friendships (and even romantic relationships) and improve everyone's equipment. The game has a reputation system for each character, and winning their trust will give you bonuses in combat and open up additional questlines. It's a nice idea but also one that's easy to neglect. The game also treats morally ambiguous sorceress Morrigan and sarcastic warrior Alistair as almost the secondary main characters, each with huge roles to play in the endgame, which is rather bizarre if you've just gone through 95% of the game favouring other characters instead. All of the companion characters are nicely-developed, though it's far from the strongest cast BioWare have produced for a game and some self-derivation can be detected: Shale is awesome, for example, but feels a little too reminiscent of Knights of the Old Republic's HK-47.You spend the game doing what you usually do in a BioWare games: a broad variety of quests, varying from the mundane to the epic, and getting into lots of conversations and fights. A lot of fights: you seem to spend the overwhelming majority of the game in combat, and violence seems to be the solution to almost every problem in the game. There's a few quests based on diplomacy and dialogue, and a few fights can be avoided through intimidating or persuading the enemy, but otherwise be prepared to do a ton of fighting. Fortunately, the old 'hit space to pause' option is still present and correct, allowing you to assign orders to characters and take stock of the battle as it develops. A quickbar allows easy access to abilities, spells and weapons. Combat is generally satisfying, although health spells feel a little weak (at high level they restore so few hit-points it's almost not worth bothering with them). The biggest weakness is positioning: enemy units can clip or shove past your units with ease, making it impossible to create bottlenecks in corridors and engage the enemy with warriors whilst wizards and ranged fighters engage from afar. This seriously limits tactical options and can make fighting large numbers of tough enemies particularly difficult. Some abilities also feel overpowered: the enemy's ability to encase your characters in null-magic zones where healing magic simply does not work can result in total party wipe-outs all too easily.In technical terms, the game is okay. Graphically it looks solid on PC (but a bit washed-out on consoles) and mods are available to improve textures further. The game is a bit flaky on multi-core PCs but runs fine if you assign it to run on just one core. Camera control is a bit of an issue: the PC version allows you to play the game from an overhead viewpoint (reminiscent of Neverwinter Nights except, bizarrely for a seven years-newer game, far less customisable) but you can't zoom out very far, and enemies often engage you from outside this viewing range. Switching to the over-the-shoulder view (which the consoles are limited to) is great for spotting distant enemies and engaging them at range, but is useless for melee. You can switch between them easily enough, but it feels a bit annoying you can't stay in the viewpoint you favour throughout the game. The overhead view also sometimes seems to get confused on whether it should be 'locked onto' your selected character or allowing you to free-roam.The writing is a mixed bag. A lot of dialogue in the game is obvious, expositionary and risible, not helped by severely variable voice acting (Claudia Black is the standout as Morrigan). There are attempts at nuanced characterisation - key villain Loghain has his reasons for doing what he's doing, though he's such an unrepentant martinet that most players will feel zero sympathy for him - but they mostly fall flat. The game also makes a nod towards gritty realism through its political infighting and bloody combat, though the game goes completely over-the-top with your characters walking out of fights covered head-to-foot in gore. The political angle also doesn't work very well due to the politics being rather boring and it's difficult to care about Ferelden when you spend most of the game hearing about how isolationist and racist it is, riven by internal conflicts with few genuinely good people in positions of authority.Despite the clunky writing, poor camera controls and focus on violence as the solution to just about everything, the game just about manages to keep its head above water. It's satisfyingly huge and the worldbuilding is derivative (a mash-up of standard fantasy tropes with more than a bit of inspiration from George R.R. Martin) but somewhat interesting. The differing opening sections of the game give some good replay value. Combat is solid if unspectacular. There's a germ of a really good game here, but there's also an overwhelming feeling of blandness and predictability that rears its head all too often.Dragon Age: Origins (***) is a very solid game from BioWare, although it's self-reflection on BioWare's past is rather pointless: the Baldur's Gate series is still extremely playable and frankly on almost every front bar the technical one are better games than Dragon Age. For those simply after a big, enjoyable fantasy RPG, Dragon Age certainly fits the bill. Its ambition is impressive and even in failing to fully achieve it, it's still very playable and worth a look.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}

BF2 is far too geared to tanks and planes.  there needs to be more emphasis on foot soldiers.  too much time getting around, too much empty space, not enough action = not fun.the other thing they screwed up is the PC voice commands.  while saying things like \"enemy chopper spotted,\" or \"need ammo here!\" well the commands SOUND awesome.  the problem is, you can't tell WHO is saying them!  you're supposed to look at the mini-map and see which dot is blinking yellow, apparently.. they need to make it easier.  call of duty does a better job at that.a tip for you:  if you're using zone alarm and having connection problems with this game, turn zone alarm off and turn windows firewall on.  this solved all my connection problems like many other people are having.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2006"}

Martin","summary":"Great value for the price!","reviewText":"Even though I'm writing a five star review, it should be noted that I still have significant reservations about this game. Firstly, the game is extremely buggy as other people will probably mention. Expect the game to crash quite a lot, and saving often can help because if you hit a spot in the game that makes it crash repeatedly, you should be able to go back to a slightly earlier save game so you don't have to start all over in the campaign.The graphics are much better than I expected. I was able to run the single player campaign at 1920 x 1200 resolution without an issue.The game also includes the option of taking different actions along the way that can change the outcome of the game. your choice to perform or not to perform certain tasks can change the game outcome.The mature element to the game adds a lot of flavor that other role-playing games simply haven't matched in my experience, although granted I've only played two role-playing games with the mature rating so far. This maturity in the story line and the flavor it adds to the game should provide you with a unique kind of experience that you won't get from many mainstream role-playing games like Neverwinter Nights that are rated \"T.\" I find that this game's willingness to delve into mature content adds a certain character, flavor, and realism to the game that Neverwinter Nights simply didn't include. All the blood and gore in this game makes the necromancers you will fight so much more understandably evil then they would be if the game were \"toned down\" you might say to make it \"less offensive\" like the T-rated mainstream RPGs. It also makes the game feel much more real and engaging.I found the first person view that you are provided with to be an interesting change from playing the old Neverwinter Nights series. I certainly feel more engaged with my surroundings because of the first-person view. At the same time, I sort of wish I could see my character, craft his armor, changed his appearance, and that sort of thing that a gamer can grow accustomed to being able to do after playing Neverwinter Nights games.The puzzles, traps, bosses, and adventures you engage in make me think of a typical Dungeons & Dragons type experience, but this game includes some unique items that can make these kinds of puzzles a little bit more \"out of the box\" and interesting than many other RPGs. if I could describe the gameplay of this game, I would say that it has a style that combines Diablo 2, Dungeons & Dragons, and the old PC game \"Myst\" to some extent.Of course, there are far fewer spells and skills in this game than there are in Dungeons & Dragons. On the plus side, this will make it easier to pick up for beginners, but also limits the variety present in the game. Still, at the price point this is selling for, it's hard to complain considering all the fun you can get out of the game.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in action role-playing games, the might and Magic series, or to Neverwinter Nights fans who are looking for another enjoyable single player campaign setting. While the game has flaws, it was on the whole a very enjoyable and unique experience for me. It's also hard to pass up considering the great price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}

Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil.

Featuring Chris Redfield of the originalResident Eviland Sheva Alomar, a West African agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), this sci-fi survival game is staged in a remote desert colony packed with hordes of fast-moving, quick-thinking enemies that represent a whole new breed of evil..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: 20px; } table.callout { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, serif; margin: 10px; width: 250; } td.callout { height: 100 percent; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding: 10px; width: 250px; } ul.callout { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -12px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; } h5.callout { text-align: center; } img.withlink {border:1px black solid;} a.nodecoration {text-decoration: none}Cooperative game play options let you take teamwork to a new level.View larger.Dramatic graphics and lighting effects add a realistic edge to your mission.View larger.Move through vast environments that have a discernable impact on game play.View larger.You'll face faster enemies backed by improved AI.View larger.Meet Two Fierce, Playable Main CharactersBack from the original title andResident Evil: Code Veronica, former S.T.A.R.S. special forces team member Redfield is a battle-tested, founding member of the BSAA. With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"techmannn \"techmannn\"","summary":"impressive and fun single player game","reviewText":"Other than some minor quibbles this is a great single player game.  It has the usual fault for a game in this action shooter genre:1. some levels are more fun that others.  You wont want to do the dark level cave more than once ever for example. Other levels are awesome however.2. some bosses are simply tedious to kill during your first play through.  You are given low power weapons.  It takes no skill just time.  On replays you can beef up your weapons which is a great thing but that first play thru the bosses were great to look at but tedious to kill.3. The aim is not precise enough.  This is I suppose partly intentional on the game designers' part but the game gives you little gun ammunition, so a lazy aiming reticule can be annoying in a firefight.  You can accelerate the aiming reticule as a game option but it doesnt help.  If there was one thing about the game that brings it down to 4 stars this is the thing.  Not a gamebreaker but certainly annoying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

Perhaps things have changed lately or will soon, but last time I was not using my Xbox Live account for several months, it was a complete pain to cancel the auto-renewal with my credit card that was in place, and I ended up having to call in to deal with it.

InDarkCloud, however, the world is destroyed by a malevolent genie in the very beginning, and it's your job to put it back together. This action/RPG will require you to battle your way through dungeons to collect vital artifacts with which you'll rebuild the game's world in real-time 3-D. From there, you can view the world from above, zoom in, revolve 360 degrees around it, and, of course, explore it for more artifacts to build other parts of the world.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fun gameplay and a variety of mini-games","reviewText":"I'm a huge Zelda fan, and was looking for something similar on the PS2. Dark Cloud combines a very Link-like character with dungeon crawl combat, quest solving, and mini games too.The main thrust of the game is that you're trying to rebuild a series of homes destroyed by the Evil Enemy. To do so, you go slogging through nearby dungeons, finding home-bits like beds, lamps and so on, on your adventures. When you bring them back to town, you have to figure out which items to where to please the people. In addition, the houses themselves have to be placed so that the people are happy. Some people want to live near a stream, some want to have morning sun in certain windows, and so on.Your weapons can be customized as you go, and need to be maintained. This gives you a bit of RPG-like control over your life, more in fact than most Zelda games provide to you.In addition, there are some fun mini-games which help break up the dungeon crawling, and give you a bit of variety.The game's provides much longer gameplay time (usually several weeks) than many other PS games on the market, meaning it's a good value for the price. Perhaps the only downsides are the graphics, which aren't top-notch, and the dungeon crawling being a bit tedious after several hours. Still, it's a good, fun game to play. Grab one for your PS library!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2002"}

Great art direction and pretty good character animation (though the lead character runs a little on the slow side). The Disney-esque stills are also quite nice and add to the production value.Game play is easy to pick up and pretty original. I like the ability to fight multiple foes in a bloody battle and, on the fly, to change your opponents. Fighting 4, 5, or 6 opponents can be pretty nerve-wracking. Battles can get bloody...it'd make Conan proud. Swinging that big sword and seeing heads fly is pretty satisfying...almost as rewarding as plunging it into your victim's writhing body. Nice!Overall, I think MARK OF KRI holds a lot of potential. I had to force myself to stop playing because I need to get some work done...but so far in the first two levels,  I was met with a lot of action. Sneaking around to grab your enemies from behind makes it even more fun. But the biggest relief was that, aside from a few levers I had to pull, there were no stupid puzzle or crates that needed moving/destroying.This game's got a really nice barbarian feel, and I found myself already wanting to see the movie.

There are six at all times, but some crazy guy wants to kill off the curse or something like that. The story isn't explained very well and not very interesting. The Mark of Kri's strong points are the stealth, but it has sluggish combat and camera issues galore. It may have been pretty good ten years ago, but not today.The game is very linear with usually only one pathway to follow. You have a bird that is your companion that you can send off to certain points to scout ahead for you.  This is mandatory otherwise you will be fighting off tons of guys all the time and dying. Once you use Kuzu to scout ahead you can plan an attack. Use stealth by sneaking up, buckling against walls, or dropping down on enemies. You use the right analog stick to sweep a beam around that assigns a face button to an enemy, that's their attack button. You can stealth kill two enemies by starting the attack on one then pressing the buttons shown above the second enemy. Some times you need to distract guards by shooting bells with your arrow, scaring animals and other things. This is pretty fun and finding the right path through enemies can be fun. It is the actual combat that is sluggish and troublesome.The right analog stick should have been used for camera control in this game because it gets lost all the time. It never focuses on enemies like it should and take forever to sweep around. The combat is ok when there are just a few enemies, but later on in the game 15+ will surround you. You get better weapons like the axe that can lock on up to 9 enemies, but this whole lock on business just doesn't work. I would rather control the camera and have a more fluid combat system that way. The reason why I died so much was that Rau will stop and rub his head, trip constantly, bang his weapon off of stone walls, get it stuck in wood, and this is frustrating. In the mean time you are being hit and dying while all the unnecessary animations are playing out. Once you get surrounded or trapped you're dead. Backing out is impossible because once you unblock you get bombarded by attacks.If that isn't enough the save system is annoying. There are no save points, just save scrolls. You have to find these and they don't carry over to the next level. Same goes for max health upgrades. You will end up using your save scrolls or squandering them because you want to save at a hard part. Another issue was using the bow. Aiming at enemies takes forever because you have to wonder around the enemy until you get a lock on and if the enemy is too high up you have to fiddle with it until you hit the enemy. Not fun.The graphics are just average, even for back then. The game is only 6 levels long and can be beaten in about 4-5 hours. The story is underdeveloped due to the short length and you won't care about any of the characters.

From what I've seen, the two games are about equal in terms of graphics so my review should be accurate for the PS2 version as well.There have been games throughout the years that have truly done something original, different and completely engaging. It always seems to be that these games fall by the wayside in terms of popularity which is a shame. Indigo Prophecy falls into this category as an original game with a fantastic premise and incredibly exciting gameplay.Never before have I played a game that was so interactive in its story-telling. When trying to describe this game, I would point to God of War, a PS2 game in which there were scenes where you have timed button presses that would move forward a cutscene. It helped bring you into the story, the cutscenes so that it was you that were doing all of the cool acrobatic manuevers killing the hydra. Another game that used this to a lesser effect was Resident Evil 4, for example with the knife fight that you had to push buttons to keep Leon safe. Indigo Prophecy takes this idea and pushes it to the extreme.IP is basically and incredibly interactive movie. It mixes the adventure genre, which is seldom seen on console, and movies and melds them into a cohesive and incredibly engaging story. It starts off with a bang as you immediately find yourself killing someone you don't know in a diner. You feel like you're not in control of your actions and as a result you have a body in a restroom and a policeman drinking coffee in the restaurant. What do you do? You're free to act from here on out. Do you leave the body and rush out? Do you hide the body? What about the blood? What about the blood on you? What about the knife? When you leave do you pay your bill? You can take care of all or none of the options above. And the story will be different, sometimes marginally sometimes drastically. Oh, and by the way, that cop sitting outside needs to use the restroom and soon the screen will split and you better be out of there before he makes it to the restroom.This opening sequence exemplifies everything this game is about. Choices, story and gameplay all merged into one. But innovation doesn't end there. As soon as Lucas (the murdering protagonist) is free of the diner, you take control of two police detectives who investigate the scene. You can switch between the two on the fly and you have to find clues, make theories and basically do everything in your power to catch Lucas. Its this give and take gameplay, where you have to play one side against the other, that truly gives the game a sense of urgency and excitement.Going back to the God of War example, when you have cutscenes in this game, you better not put your controller down. Gameplay pushes forward the story-centered bits as well. Whether its doing a simon says type control scheme to manuever your character past cars that are hurtling toward him, alternating between the L and R trigger as fast as you can to save someone who's drowning or using the R stick to make dialogue choices on the fly (you're timed) to hear all you can, the game makes sure to bring you into the story. Its very effective and really ratchets up the tension.If there is one sore spot in the game its the graphics. While not bad, exactly, they don't necessarily push the Xbox in the way that this last year of Xbox life should. It looks like a first or possibly second generation Xbox game. Artistically the game is good. The characters in the cutscenes move really well and realistically. And there is never a moment of lag or skipping seen in a lot of games today. The character's faces have some nice emotion to them and the graphics aren't stellar, like I said, but they do a decent job. There's a ton of aliasing, however, which is sad.Another sore spot is the controls. When you are in direct control of your character (i.e. actually moving them as opposed to having control of the cutscenes via button pressing) the game is pretty loose. It reminds me of playing the old Resident Evil games. You have the cinematic camera which causes some confusion as to which direction you should push your character. As a result, you will do a lot of figure 8s in the game which can cause a lot of problems when you have to hide the evidence because a cop is at your door and the timer is going down. Character animation while moving is also very stiff and a big difference from the cut scene animation.The audio is terrific, however. While the box says the game does not run in 5.1 in game, I think it lies. My receiver lights up whenever 5.1 is being used and its always lit with this game. And it sounds like 5.1 is being used. The voice acting is absolutely wonderful and professional. Each voice matches the character and it helps enhance this feeling of playing a murder mystery movie. With voice acting becoming so important in games today, this is most welcome and really helps sell the game. Musically, the game also excels by using the very talented Angelo Badalamenti to score it. That name might not mean much on the outset but he has created scores to many Hollywood movies including most by David Lynch (Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., Twin Peaks) but also Dark Water, Arlington Road, etc. The score is absolutely beautiful and moving; it really fits in with what is happening on screen.What this game does best is meld the story-telling of a movie with the gameplay of video games. It exposes the limitations of both and yet uses the best of both to create an engaging, moving and very interactive story. For me, this game is a perfect building block for video games. I can overlook most of its flaws because it is so different, so exciting and so damn cool. It warrants a 5 star review simply because of what it did. I would most heartedly recommend this game to those who love a good story, like action adventure games and want to be impressed with what video games and movies can accomplish together.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"A very engrossing adventure","reviewText":"Look to the center of the console adventure gaming galaxy, and there you will find Link. Every heart piece you've ever collected and gem you've gathered, every block you've pushed and wall you've bombed open, every Dark World you've visited and 3D sword-lock you've acquired-all these things stem from Shigeru Miyamoto's incremental innovations in arranging adventure game 1s and 0s. This time, however, our Hero's had an inspiration of a different sort. Few things in this life have gotten gamers as riled up as the Great Kiddifying of Young Master Link; chances are you'd already convinced yourself whether you love Cel-da or hate him before you'd even played the game. For the cel-haters, no amount of gushing is gonna change your mind-even if you heard that the quality of the liquid watercolor animation rivals (heck, surpasses) Disney's best, or that the game's spirit taps into the same natural-mystical kid/adult crossover zone occupied by the finest films of Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke). For the cel-lover, The Wind Waker will be the adventure of a lifetime...a combination of vivid artistry and timeless gameplay that radiates magic shiny happy life light. Miyamoto's goal has always been to make sure that everything that goes into his games only serves to make them more fun...features lists and demographic data be damned. In that regard, The Wind Waker doesn't stray from the winning formula that's made the series such a smashing success. The Overworld still holds more secrets than you'll ever find. Dungeons contain the standard assortment of maps, new tools, and boss battles. Even Link's new baton is essentially a dressed-up version of the Ocarina of Time as you learn various songs to open doors, transport across the map, and change night into day. There are still blocks to push and chests to open-though all of this is handled with a bit more wisdom and a bit more refinement. The game features fewer \"dungeons\" in the traditional sense, but the ones that are here tend to be huger and more challenging with new twists (several of the more ingenious ones have you leading around another character, Ico-style, to solve puzzles). Later in the game, the notion of \"dungeons\" is all but overthrown by a series of wonderfully elaborate treasure hunts that are sure to tax even the most accomplished Zelda gamer.The biggest (non-Celda-related) change comes in the way the Overworld is presented: as a vast ocean, set in a 7x7 grid, each square containing an island with something to find-a heart container piece or rupee stash at the least, an entire bird-person city or multi-level dungeon at the most. Each island is surrounded by tons of other stuff to tax your to-do list: some magic fish to find, some unexpected mini racecourse to traverse, some shark to kill, some random treasure trove to yank up from the brine. In many ways, the structure resembles Westwood's underappreciated Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat. While trekking between islands threatens to become tedious, there's always a million somethings to do on the way if you're so inclined-treasure maps to decipher, giant squids to encounter, submarines to pilfer, Great Fairies to free. Even so, the game's surprisingly non-linear, exploration-nurturing nature often requires patience and sturdy sea legs for backtracking. Combat is a supreme joy-it incorporates Ocarina's lock-on system, though new additions like countering and disarming are a cause for celebration (combos create awesome Looney Tunes-y \"dynamic soundtracks\"), and experimenting on foes with your newly acquired tools generates lots of happy fun hormone. You'll rarely die, and while the boss battles are glorious, they're not exactly tough. More fun/less frustrating is the game's fighting philosophy. Unfortunately, the camera can really freak out on you, and you'll often find yourself in first-person mode when you meant to be locked on. Where things get truly challenging is in the puzzles: For most of the game, the fun-to-frustration ratio is pitch perfect, but be warned that you will get stuck as the Wind Waker has a knack for turning the most mundane box-pushing puzzle into a test for a Mensa membership. Take, for example, the Earth Dungeon, which does for \"reflecting light\" what Ocarina of Time did for \"changing water levels.\" All this, of course, is stitched together by one of the most creative and beautiful worlds ever conceived and brought to life...not just in video gaming, but in the whole realm of animation, film, and art. While The Wind Waker may be a bit too complex for the young, it's definitely made for the young at heart. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker dares to defy the notion that games need to be more \"gritty and realistic\" by choosing instead to become exactly the opposite. Link's is an adventure as old as time, but it feels like the most refreshing game in the world thanks to creative daring, insanely superior production values, and-above all-gameplay that would be fun even if Link were five colors, 16 pixels, and carried a blue monochrome block for a sword","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2003"}

If you haven't played any of the Civilization games, by all means, purchase this game as quick as possible because you have no idea what you're missing!  A time encompassing game primarily about world conquest, you control a civilization from caveman times to the present day and expand world borders attempting to win the game in different ways.  The third version of this popular series still follows the same gameplay format that made it a universal favorite and that's why I had problems with it: It didn't change much.I suppose it's difficult for a software company to live up to a famous title's reputation when it's already one of the classic strategy games of all-time but I didn't feel like I got my money's worth after playing this game for a week.  Frankly, I'm already bored with the game.There are some new and interesting changes to the game.  One of the most obvious new features is a system that relies on specific resources (oil, rubber, etc.) rather than allowing you the ability to build anything you choose.  Another great new feature is the expanded diplomacy option with just about anything in the game available for trading with other countries.  The game is much smarter now and computer opponents make better decisions.  This may have led to what I find one of the biggest problems in the game, the incredibly slow running speed.  The more computer controlled civilizations you allow in your game, the slower it runs from turn to turn.  Even with low amounts of civilizations, when the game has progressed to a later point in time and the world is heavily populated, it can take at least a minute for the computer to decide its moves in one turn.  I have a decent system and would recommend that anyone with a slow processor be prepared to practice their patience as you will be playing games that will take a LONG TIME.  I have no problem with strategy games that take a while before completing the objectives but Civilization III loses its appeal when I make decisions in a few quick seconds and then wait a minute or two for the computer to complete its turn.If this is your first time to play the Civilization series, the instruction manual is phenomenal and it is equipped with an in-game encylopedia that describes all units, buildings, wonders, etc. to you.  I was disappointed that the game didn't come with enough new aspects to force me to read the instructions much.  I jumped right in to Civilization III as though I didn't miss anything from the previous version.The provided scenarios/maps aren't near as good as the other versions and civilizations do not start in their historically correct positions on a simulated world map.  I would check the internet as there are bound to be plenty of interesting maps and modifications created by players.  Also, the game does not come with a multiplayer internet format.  Knowing the recent history of PC games, the company will probably release a costly expansion pack in later months that will allow you to play this on the internet with other players.A great game for anyone that is new to the Civilization series but in my opinion, only a fair game for returning players.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Rezivor","summary":"Nearly a perfect game, another amazing Mario Kart!","reviewText":"Mario Kart 8 is a very fun, great game. It has the usual simple controls (plus the motion w/ steering wheel or gamepad if you choose). The gameplay is fantastic, the power of the Wii U makes the graphics in awesome HD. And with Mario Kart 8 you get a overall more expansive Mario Kart experience than ever before! Many tracks, both classics beautifully remade & new one's too! Many characters to unlock and choose from. Including your Mii character(s). You can unlock various kart parts too! The levels have gravity defying elements. You have new weaponry to get in the boxes....And of course there are several types to play. 50cc,100cc,150cc,battle,time attack,ect.. the game like I said is nearly perfect. Great characters,gameplay,graphics,replay value (especially w/ friends or online), awesome unlockables....The one thing I dislike about this game is the screen layout when playing two players on the same TV. The split screen is vertically split instead of horizontal. You can see the track ok overall, but it just feels and looks a little enclosed and odd like that. It can't be changed in the settings either. So maybe playing one person on the gamepad screen & the other on TV is better for some? And of course playing 4 play the screen is split 4 ways, which is fine then, and expected. Not a major issue or deal breaker.....Just would be nice to play it split screen like Gears Of War,COD,ect..if desired. I highly recommend getting this game!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2014"}

Anyways, I own the game and I'm about 4 hrs into the game and I'm loving it.  Graphic is top notch! Virtually no loading wait during game play! Story so far is ok~ but I expect a big twist at the end.  The best character voice! he's quite funny and thinks like me time to time. Music fits very well.  Now, there is a reason I gave it 4 star.....  this game really focuses on acrobatics and not on combats.  Within 4 hrs, I encountered less than 10 monsters.....  It definitely has cool combos and what not but I didn't had enough time to practice out the combos.. I just press any button and see some cool sequences.  Also, you can only attack when there is an enemy nearby... so you can't even practice the combos.  Even the enemies are very easy to beat (depending in how fast button smasher you are).  Perhaps, for the people who played PoR then they may know some combos but this is my first PoR.Most of the time while playing this game, my thoughts are \"where do I go? how do I climb up/down? how do I solve this silly puzzle?\" as you can see this is not a game where you kill 1000's of monsters.  In a way, I like it but more monsters would've been better too...even at one moment the main character says \"Finally! Something I can hit on\" before the fight.  Anyways, this is definitely unique game that's worth playing that is NOT FPS!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"Goth of War: An Uncharted Nightmare","reviewText":"First, as a gamer who played the original Castlevania on the NES and has generally enjoyed every 2D incarnation, I can tell you this in no way feels like Castlevania at all.  It's simply a gothic God of War with aggravating platforming and puzzles that aren't really puzzles at all.The graphics in this game are a mixed bag.  They look decent, but the framerate is so choppy it reminded me of GTA3.  There's no slowdown, but all the movement just looks unnatural.  The sound effects are nothing special at all, and one of the bosses kept spamming the same taunt so many times I wanted to throw my controller right through the TV.The combat is a straight GOW clone, with points having to be earned to level up your weapon so you can attempt to use combo attacks.  Too bad all but the simplest of enemies block repeatedly so it's nearly impossible to ever land one.  Mind you, I beat Ninja Gaiden Sigma, so I have no issues with games that feature complex combat and a high level of difficulty.  Also on the GOW ripoff front, one of your weapons is a gauntlet.  One stage even has ruins that look like Greece.  When I wasn't gritting my teeth over my endlessly blocked attacks, I was constantly moving to get the enemies back on screen since the camera is terrible.  As if this game isn't derivative enough, some of the bosses are actually called Titans.  They didn't even attempt to be original.  The start to one of those battles involved just running around at a distance like an idiot for a full minute before you can finally do anything.  I can't convey enough how stupid the boss battles are in this game.  When you're not climbing up some gigantic creature, you're running from whatever imps are there to annoy you so you can't hit a boss more than once or twice without taking damage.  Wouldn't want to actually be able to use any of those combos you spent points on, would you?  Striking an enemy does NOT keep it from attacking, so unless it has just missed an attack and has its back to you, you'll never land more than two hits without taking damage.I also found myself cursing over not being able to advance.  This wasn't because the puzzles are too hard, but because they are nearly invisible within the game environment.  I spent lots of time scratching my head and attempting to make a jump when the whole time there was a ledge or something to hook my chain to that I just didn't see.  Objects that you're supposed to interact with glow, but not always.  At one point I had to remove the handle from one wheel to use on another.  The problem?  The wheel blended right in with the wall in the room it was in and did not glow.  After 20 minutes of circling through the entire level repeatedly, I resorted to a walkthrough and was furious to find out the solution, one I NEVER would have spotted and required no thought to \"solve\".Then there are the platforming elements, which are entirely unnecessary as they add nothing to the gameplay and don't work well at all.  When holding onto a ledge, half the time pushing the analog stick does not send Gabriel in the right direction.  Several times instead of moving along the ledge, he just let go and fell.  Far too often I was never sure what direction he would jump, which again led to falling and trying again.  It's like somebody just said \"Hey, Uncharted is popular and involves jumping along ledges, let's throw some of that in here.\"  In one case there was an area where I was completely stuck on where to go.  Turns out there was one exact point I had to jump from to land on the next platform, which was off camera.  Wow, just wow.I've been a gamer all my life and never shy away from a challenge, but this game is overtly awful in every possible way.  I actually got angry enough to shout \"I hate this game!\" several times in a manner similar to those Gamefly commercials.  I changed the difficulty all the way down to easy just to make it go by faster, and even then it was torture.  To finish off an early boss, I had to go around the room smashing statues.  Are you kidding me?!  It had nothing to do with anything, and was another random thing I needed a walkthrough to figure out.  It has been a long time since I've played anything this terrible.  Don't even waste the money to rent this garbage, let alone buy it.  I know there are lots of good reviews, but I'm warning you, just don't do it.  Games like this make me angry at the developers because it's as if none of them are gamers themselves and have no concept of what is fun and what is the height of frustration.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

So I picked it up at the rental store, and thank God I did only rent this game and waste $5 as opposed to $60.From the moment you turn the game on, the graphics and story line pull you right in. You watch a few movie segments go by, which are awesome, and then you are cast into game play. This is when the game takes a sharp turn down hill.From the moment you start playing you are hopelessly delivered an ambiance trying to recreate something between the lines of games' Max Payne, Dead to Rights, and The Punisher. Instead, you end up flying around with guns blazing on what seems like unlimited ammo at your dumb enemies mindlessly killing everything in sight. I might add that there are ridiculous amounts of enemies that come at you from all over the place, and yet it takes about a hundred gun shots or so to bring you down. This is on the normal difficulty I might add. Then while you're trying to like this game, you can't help but realize the graphics on this game could have been accomplished on a last-gen console, and it probably could have been even better than that.I'd also like to mention that your enemies' AI are probably dumber than a toaster oven. They don't take cover. They don't try and flank you or out wit you. They just all simply take bad shots at you as they stand in the middle of their little area waiting to be shot.The game controls are a bit clumsy as well, making this game even harder to try and enjoy. It's easy to shoot, don't get me wrong, but with so many enemies coming around you from all different angles out of nowhere, it's difficult to try and get a grasp on who and what you're shooting at. There is a cover system, but no where near is there the kind of fluidity that takes place in gaining cover compared to Gears of War or the late Tom Clancy games of Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon.There is no innovation of any kind either. Bullet time is stolen from Max Payne, and there's the kind of third person shooting game play we get that's reminiscent from second and third rate games. The stages and levels get old fast. It's the same every few seconds. Go into an area, fight off 50 bad guys, press the left control pad button a few times to heal yourself, and move on. I lost interest after a half of days worth of game play. I think I would rather be strangled to near death than play this game. Then again, playing this game was kind of like that. *shrugs*","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2007"}

The graphics might be the best so far on next gen hardware but it's not just looks. The game also involves some strategy because you need to understand the track and what vehicle is best for it.  If you know the tracks easiest way is through mud then it's a good idea to get a larger vehicle like a big rig or a mud plugger.The offline mode could of used multi-player split screen big time. But it serves as training as it takes you through the same tracks over and over with different vehicles and difficult levels. Once you get good then it's just fun and relaxing but still challenging. The graphics are eye candy and the desert tracks and backgrounds are nice to look at, the tracks also have changing time and weather effects like day and night. Going throw single player mode will also unlock more vehicles you can use. Of course a lot of people give it major knocks for not having offline split screen and using the same eight tracks over and over.Online, the relaxing ends and you're up for a major challenge against other people. Depending on the game your in, the moderator selects the track for each race and what type of vehicles you can select from.

My first assumption was that Planescape would be a  knock-off of Baldur's Gate, and be fun but not unique.It is, amazingly,  far more than that.Sure, it's built on the same great engine that  Baldur's Gate was. Same third person view, with the great graphics and  sounds that BG is famous for. However, the developers of Planescape  definitely knew what they were doing when they enhanced the system. They  addressed many complaints gamers had with BG, and took it to another level.Take death. Yes, that pesky death stuff that seems to happen to gamers  when they encounter a group of basilisks or perhaps a bandit or three. No  problem for Planescape - you're immortal! Not only that, but deaths  actually help you sometimes, jarring loose memories that were until that  point hidden. Like who you are. What you're about. Why you're immortal when  apparently nobody else is.Which brings me to another point - the  storyline is great! They take an idea that has definitely been done before  - you wake up with amnesia, uncertain of your past or present. Nine Princes  of Amber is a famous story that does this very well. So you learn as you  go, with the help of your amusing sidekick, the skull named Morte. Yes,  your pal is a floating skull who follows you along :)The game is  understandably &quot;dark&quot;. You are, after all, someone who keeps  rising from the grave, wandering around a miserable little town full of  unhappy people. It's probably not a game for 6 year olds, but most  teenagers will easily relate to the misery of the town's occupants. You  find things like clot charms to help heal your wounds, bandages to tape  yourself back up. It's the same quests and challenges, but it's so much  more ...Your alignment actually alters as you interact with NPCs. Keep  doing good things - your alignment is naturally good. Keep slaughtering  innocents while they plead for mercy, and yup, you're bad. Your alignment  then affects how people react to you. Even better - your intelligence  determines what you can say or do in some cases!  No more of this idiotic  barbarian easily figuring out how to deal with a noble negotiator.I was  impressed!There are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through. You wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back. You  wander outside and find a note-zombie, with notes stuck to his body. Every  doorway can be a portal to another world, if you find the key. But keys can  be anything - a piece of paper, a certain person, even a song sung in a  certain way.The game is definitely a thinking game - one created for  true strategists and role players, who want a challenge out of a game and  not just a hack-fest. For gamers who have complained that RP could never be  fun on a computer, try Planescape Torment. You just might have your hands  full!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2000"}

I killed a clown with chainsaws, some big fat cop who looks like Kathy Kinney (from The Drew Carey Show), a pyromaniac who looks like Weird Al, and a weird raincoat/green mask-wearing cult that totally freaks me out.  I'm a little behind on the main missions but the game hasn't ended yet so I figure I'm good.DAY 34: I hate this game so much.

It doesn't really make too much sense.  Worse, there are multiple endings and I missed the chopper pick-up time on the roof of the mall.  I'm going to start over from my last save point (which is few and far between).  I'm starting to really hate this game.DAY 42: I did it!  Almost.  Now the U.S. military is \"cleaning up\" the operation by killing everyone. Gee, glad I went through all the trouble to save all the hot chicks.  Oh well, a few katana slices takes care of them nicely.  But then there's this long battle with a tank and then some military guy who is impossible to beat.

I bought the game used, not greatest hits, and it had trouble because of the condition it was in, so I bought a new copy that is the greatest hits version.  The older one comes with a case that is very annoying because it is really hard to get disc 2 out.  I was worried about having to bend the disc to get it out.

The game has something that most RTS are missing and that's a great story. You play through four campaigns (Humans, Undead, Orcs, and Night Elves) and watching as the Undead try to corrupt the world. What's interesting about the story is it's like playing a game of chess with yourself. Without spoiling anything you basically play one campaign then it leads to the next, but your ironically fighting against what you just did in the other campaign. It's a great change in pace and keeps the story interesting.The game is mainly focused on the four races and they all play differently and uniquely. You have the Humans which are average in everything. They can perform magic and fight with weapons about equally, the Undead can kill off their own units for health and eat other enemies for health, they also can't build on ground unless it's been blighted by a Necropolis building (think town hall), Orcs have lots of health and are super strong, but use little to no magic and are slow at building things, and Night Elves are very weak but can hide in shadow and move very fast while manipulating nature to their whim. This makes every campaign feel different and won't bore you at all. What's different in WC3 as well are the types of missions you have. You may have some missions where you defend something for a set amount of time, some missions have you wiping out all enemies, some are fetch quests, and others are just you and a few units trying to find something. This tossing things up and won't keep you saying \"not another building up and killing mission\". Another main pull in WC3 are the Heroes that you use.Each Hero can level up and use 4 different spells to help you win the level. Some spells are offensive, defensive, or passive so they just work by adding attributes or are Auras which apply to surrounding friendlies. These will really help you in a pinch and are well balanced. Of course you have to learn some spells by leveling up, but they are all unique for each Hero you use. You can also buy things from Merchants that are scattered throughout the maps to buy healing potions, protective spells, town hall portals, and even hire mercenaries to do your dirty work. This also can change the way things turn out and is just another great addition to the depth of WC3. WC3 may not be as deep as Civilization or Age of Empires, but it still offers brain work for RTS fans. To eliminate micromanagement WC3 only allows up to 90 units to be built (technically only about 25-30 since each different type of unit takes up more food) you can also only have up to 12 units selected at a time. While this can be a bit of a problem when evading large encampments it still keeps the micromanagement down.I also found issues with the difficulty. Some levels are super easy and some levels attempt invincibility cheats because your units never seem strong enough to most enemies. It may take a level 10 Hero up to 30 seconds to kill a level 4 enemy so this is really unfair. The game is also absurdly long clocking in about 40-50 hours depending on how you play. Some levels will finish with only one unit left with a pixel of health so you can see the difficulty is really unfair. WC3 works like any other RTS with building, err, building and having to mine gold and wood to build units. The final issue is that this doesn't work fast enough so you'll be sitting and pinching resources while all the enemies attack you. Once you hit a high or low upkeep this can be a problem since maintaining so many units starts costing you. Gold income is low enough as it is with 10 pieces per worker. Low upkeep gives you 7 and high upkeep 4. You can imagine it would take forever to build up a few thousand gold that will only build a few troops. After your gold mine collapses you have to search for more, but most are in enemy sights so this is another issue.Other than all of that Warcraft III is an RTS that all fans must play. The excellent story complimenting the deep but subtle gameplay is rewarding and not to mention the online multiplayer through Battle.net. The graphics are bright and colorful and have a lot of detail that most RTS games don't have. The voice acting is superb and nicely accompanies beautiful pre-rendered FMVs. If you're itching for a great RTS game then look no further than Warcraft III.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

It just gives me the creeps. I guess I'm getting too old.But to quite honest, it is a very good game. Storyline is intriguing and plays well but the mapping could have been improved. I don't like how you have to activate radio towers to open new areas of the map.

I bought a Wii a while back when the Wii Fit first came out because I hated fighting the traffic to get to a gym I actually preferred. I spent a lot (enough to buy 5 Wii's) for an annual gym membership. I loved the Wii Fit and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. like everything else, once the novelty wears off, so does the gameplay. I mostly played Gold's Gym Cardio Workout because I enjoyed unlocking new things (clothes, instructors, songs, etc.) To me, unlocking things has kept me motivated more than any single factor.The Wii Fit Plus has everything locked and I will enjoy unlocking the advanced exercises while getting a good workout. The exercise I think that will be most beneficial to me is Island Cycling. I like the fact that you can explore around the island and find new hidden surprises. Basically, you walk in place real fast on the balance board to keep the bicycle moving. There are ramps and hills and other little hidden gems that add to the fun. You must speed-walk (bike) around the island looking for flags. Once you find the flag, the flag becomes your Mii.

Over the years, only Halo, Halo 2, Half Life 2, Socom 2, and Counterstrike have been able to make me say \"wow\" and keep playing for months.  My games have to have it all (story, gameplay, online, sound).  This is another one to add to that list.  Resistance is all around incredible.  I would say this is one of my favorite games ever (and thats saying a ton for a launch title).  The single player comes second only to Half Life 2 and the multiplayer is on par and may be even a little better than the rest of the titles I mentioned.  I have been playing relentlessly since launch and plan to play for months to come.  Throw in the coop op mode and all the unlockables and leveling up in the online game and you have an instant classic.Probably the biggest stand out in the game are the weapons.  This game has a weapon that shoots through walls for goodness sake.  The sniper rifle slows down time.  Even the rocket launcher can be stopped in midair, fire its own volley of rockets, and then be aimed again and launched in another direction.  Its just amazing how much thought and innovation went into these weapons.  The sound is great, the story in engaging, and the graphics are very good.  They aren't Gears of War good, but then again, Resistance puts more than 4 creatures on the screen at ones and keeps a steady framerate.And last but not least, the online play (20 vs 20) is LAG FREE.  I have yet to see one instance of lag in my entire time playing the online game, and everyone else seems to have the same results.All in all, this game is amazing, and the fact that it is a launch title makes it all the more impressive.

The AI is very good and the enemies can make you want to slam down the controller often.  The game itself is 5 stars easily due to the large variety of weapons, intensity, large maps, and great storyline.  It's very enjoyable to not simply fight the same monsters on every board, each level expands to include more powerful and more intelligent adversaries.

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem.

Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"The Most Thrilling and Fear-Provoking Game Ever Conceived","reviewText":"... An all-new renovation has taken place with Capcom's second greatest franchise (the first being Street Fighter). Titled Biohazard (truly a better name than the laughable \"Resident Evil\") in Japan, the latest installment makes its way onto the Nintendo machine. And let me be among the first to say, this is probably the most thrilling and fear-provoking game ever conceived. Past attempts haven't hit this mark of steep graphical horror nor haul up the sensation of numbing dread. Konami's Silent Hill 2, eat your heart out and whimper, Capcom's Resident Evil has never felt or looked so gosh-darn spectacular. Don't listen to those who believe that the GameCube's version is merely a rehash of the PS1, half of the game is based on totally new areas, and not to mention even more explosive, edge-of-your-seat restlessness.The initial thing players will react to (after noticing the graphical tour de force) is that those brainless, sauntering zombies past games expounded are gone. Replacing them are deadlier packs who hound your tail in a startling game of cat and mouse. Crammed with smarter AI, a host of zombie fiends make an appearance. Such menaces are the ones with elongated claws that cleave wind and flesh, chasing the player down hallways. RE's arsenal of the undead just don't know when to quit either. Not only frighteningly grotesque, the undead are relentless, no longer stopping in front of staircases, adding a deeper depth of suspense. Oh, and if you still assume that refuge is taken behind a door, think again, these zombies crash right through them and continue their chase for Jill's voluptuous. . .um, brain.The combat and puzzle system work in much respect of its predecessors. Surely, Resident Evil fans will dive headfirst but find the surprise of all-new challenges. At the start, the player decides a role to choose, in this case Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, and a difficulty level. Depending on the difficulty level, the game will not be as simple as before, however Redfield's scenario is generally tougher. Jill's less taxing scenario is just the icing on the cake, whereas Redfield's scenario is plagued with an escalation of unforgiving fiends, reduced amounts of health and ammo, and strict puzzle advancement.Players now have the access of 3 different control schemes. Because I easily adapted to the default control , I ignored the concept altogether. Also, a knife defense system, an inventive tactic, has been implemented onto the game. It works when a zombie gets a hold on the player, then mechanically Chris or Jill will thrust the zombie's attack off with his or her knife, and stab it directly in its skull. This allows an opportunity for the player to break free before the zombie bars its teeth on some flesh. Like bullets, the knife defense can be exhausted and are collected all through the mansion. For those who like to conserve, the player may set it on manual mode. Quite an additional number of moves are whipped out, such as slipping a grenade in a zombie's maw and watching its head detonate. Picturesque, indeed.Fastened with fresh lineups of innovation, Resident Evil swims in a whirlpool of excellence. While hard-hitting with obstacles every so direction, the game doesn't go into a point of hopelessness. Such moments are when hordes of rushing undead, along with brand new creatures and bosses, come into the fray. Scare moments are back, and even more unsuspecting than ever. Currently in a time where the big screen has fails to make me [excited], Resident Evil on the GameCube goes well beyond that and wins legendary status.Kiss your senses goodbye and place a bib on your lap. The visuals will daze you, leave you drooling, and inflate your own personal wow factor into the heavens. This stuff is mind-blowing. I thought I seen it all when I sat through Episode II: Attack of the Clones's trailer , but this is proof that computer technology is boundless. Unbelievably detailed and decisive with every graphical effect, the atmospheric tone behind RE is gorgeously macabre. I have to admit, after playing the original RE, I zipped through the other offerings without a trace of fear. Bursting with GameCube muscle and a physically charged environment, this is a whole different story. All around, the surroundings actually work against you, playing tricks of illusion. Illumination from flickering candles or hanging light bulbs emit shadows and at times it's hard to distinguish if the movement is simply nothing or a creature stirring all too near. Layers of rolling fog obscures insinuations of approaching fiends charging at you. Our favorite canines are back, quicker, and realistically crash into the environment when they miss the player. Detailed to the extreme, from the audio of guttural moans to masterfully designed backgrounds, the game's aesthetic nature is seamlessly provocative. Originating from thousands of polygons, mixed with dazzling special effects, and just the right amount of gore, this is the best looking game in which all others of the genre will now be measured by.I could ramble on and on about the spine-chilling venues, but I'll leave that for you to ensue. Shinji Mikami, the man with the vision of the Resident Evil dream, must be gloating right now. Of all the RE games released, this is probably what his vision truly was. Refining his skill from all prior games, he finally hones perfection in his franchise. In terms of audio, graphics, gameplay, but most importantly in scaring the soul outta' gamers, RE gains pounds of its novel trademark. Mark my words, DO NOT MISS OUT on this masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2002"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"D.

And this game does deliver, but I'm not one to overlook shortcomings. I'll go through pros and cons of the SINGLE PLAYER mode.Combat:You play from a third person perspective. John Marston primarily uses guns, but also in his arsenal are the lasso, a knife, dynamite, and a few others. The main way this game sets itself apart from other third person shooters is through the use of Dead Eye. When you activate this, John slows down time and can pinpoint where you'll shoot the enemies. Over the course of the game, your Dead Eye is leveled up 2 times, each time becoming a little more useful. I found combat always engaging, and the Dead Eye concept really makes you feel like a western badass.Quests:There's a lot to accomplish in this game. You have main quests, where there are 2 or 3 quests available at a time and you can tackle whichever you feel like. Then there's outfit collecting. For this, you find \"scraps\" of the outfit throughout the world or by accomplishing various tasks. The outfits are well worth the effort as they grant different bonuses. The ongoing quests are thoroughly fun. There are 4 of them: Flower Collecting, Treasure Hunting, Animal Hunting, and shooting challenges. These are spread out over the 3 game regions, so you can't do everything at the beginning. Various other tasks arise in the game, including bringing in outlaws, stopping random crimes, and busting gang hideouts (repeatable). You can earn more money by playing Poker, Blackjack, and Liar's Dice, taming horses, doing nightwatch, and playing horseshoes. There was always something for me to do in Red Dead, which I always appreciate in a game. However, the random crimes need much more variety. I suspect that in 2 days of gameplay, you'll have seen all the random encounters.Graphics/Environment:This is a large game, set across 3 distinct regions. Across these expansive areas are settlements, and between the settlements you'll find mountains, scattered plant life, and animals. It really does feel Western and adds to immersion. The graphics are just what you'd expect from this generation.Story:Definitely not the game's strong point. Although it becomes somewhat compelling towards the end, most of the time it's the same old trying to rescue your family but to do so you have to hunt down gang members. It gets old after a while.Overall:A solid experience worth getting. You might not get a lot in the way of story, and may tire of the random encounters after a short time, but the game does most other things very well. One thing I really liked was the game completion percentage. For completionists, this is a necessity, and I always enjoyed bumping up my percentage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}

That's how great it is.I began my play-though of Skyrim as a noob to Elder Scrolls. I knew nothing of the series nor did I play any of the prior games. I was amazed by the depth of this game. The combat system, the leveling up system, the glorious open-world freedom, the sheer amount of quest, how easily I can immerse myself in Skyrim, the uniqueness of the Dragonborn storyline, the incredible graphics, the bards... I could go on for days. Really. It all was impeccable.I have never played anything so well crafted, so polished, in my entirety of gaming. It's not just a game, it is a piece of art. I cannot even count the amount of epic moments in this game. My favorite is, most definitely, the last main quest.I cannot put my controller down. I have finished the main quest-line but I am striving to only stop playing when I have felt my business in Skyrim is finished. Which is saying a lot because I have logged over 80 hours and I am STILL not finished with Skyrim.This super-epic masterpiece of a game's pros make you completely disregard its cons. However, as a thorough reviewer I must mention them. For me I would have liked to see some of the dialogue get more depth. Sometimes I felt like, to some characters, more could have been said. Another thing I want to touch on is the seemingly lack of voice actors. Yes, I do realize Skyrim is large game and has many characters, but still... I did get a little irked hearing the same voice for several different people. There were some minor bugs that I encountered. Other than that this game was utter perfection.With all that being said, I wholeheartedly believe TEV: Skyrim deserves a perfect five out of five.

{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"We've Got Fun and Games","reviewText":"For me, the \"Far Cry\" series has always been a bit of a mixed bag. The initial entry was fun, but the controls and narrative really threw me off of playing it. \"Far Cry 2\" was a step in the right direction, but the usage of malaria got incredibly grating and forced me not to finish it. Something about the initial trailers of the third entry, though, told me that this would be a game I didn't want to miss. Still, the older entries really made me taper my expectations accordingly.However, after not being able to put it down until finishing the main campaign for 3 straight days, I can not only say that \"Far Cry 3\" is the best entry in the franchise, it's also one of the greatest first-person shooters ever created, and one of the most brilliant and controversial stories told in a modern video game.Players take the role of trust-fund brat Jason Brody, who has a penchant for doing dangerous stunts for a kick, much to the chagrin of his Hollywood starlet girlfriend. But when he, his two brothers, his girlfriend and two others friends parachute onto an island under siege by pirates, profiteers, and tribal warriors, his desire to seek thrills get put to the test. Escaping by the skin of his teeth, he must rescue his family and friends from getting sold into sexual slavery, or die trying.Right off the bat, we have a story far different from \"Far Cry 3\"'s contemporaries. Not only are the women in the game victimized, but the men are as well. In fact, the men are made to look far more weak than the women. This is a bold move on Ubisoft Montreal's part, given that this is a game they're pitching to the \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield\" crowd. We see men constantly put at risk of getting raped, and in one scene, a player is forced to torture his own brother. This is not a feel-good, \"kick butt and save your friends\" kind of game. When the credits roll, no matter which of the two endings you pick, you'll be left with a harrowing and somber feeling. The evil in this game is not one which wants to destroy the world, or kill the President, but one that wants to emotionally break and exploit the protagonists.This evil is given to us two-fold by the brilliant antagonists, the loose-cannon pirate Vaas and the sadistically calculating Hoyt. Both of them represent very real evils that haunt us today as citizens of any country. But while Vaas steals the limelight in many reviews, I personally feel that Hoyt is the most important villain. This is due to the fact that he isn't a dictator or a corrupt religious figure, but a man heavily influenced by American politics and business ethics. America has molded this man's mentality and practices, and through him, we see how much damage capitalism and patriotism has done to the world at large. If you're somebody who considers themselves a \"proud patriot\", don't play this game, because it will make you reconsider how good our country REALLY is. Those who like thinking, however, will find an infinitely complex and rewarding experience.Overall, the story is full of emotional highs and lows, both orchestrated with excellent dialogue and characters who will be with you for years to come. For my money, this is the greatest story told in a first-person shooter so far.The greatness, however, isn't limited to the brilliant narrative. \"Far Cry 3\" boasts a more rich and varied world than \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\", or more suitably, \"Borderlands 2.\" Every inch of the land is teeming with life, human or otherwise, and there's never a dull moment. Whether you're meeting locals, fighting pirates, or hunting animals to make new gear, the island is massive and full of things to do. While it is a bit disappointing that the side-missions are far from exciting, it's forgivable given the massive expanse of land to explore.Getting around this land is far less cumbersome than other open worlds as well. Aside from the helpful ability of being able to infinitely sprint, there's a variety of transport options around the island. Cars, buggies, hang gliders, and jet-skis are just a few of the means of travel the player will have, and fast-travel shortcuts on the map are plentiful. Also great is the ability to get every weapon in the game for free by scaling the 18 radio towers, which unlocks more of the map, which is initially obscured. This diversion is both fun and useful, and only the specialty weapons are left for you to purchase.Aside from the world, the gameplay itself is quite refreshing. This is the best stealth-action game since \"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patiots\" in terms of how you can approach each mission. Both the shooting and sneaking mechanics are so well-polished, a player can approach almost any mission however they want to. Driving into an enemy compound and blowing every to high heck is just as valid of a strategy as devising a calculated stealth plan and tactically taking out each enemy one at a time. The sheer amount of options laid out in front of the player is impressive, and is enough to make me forgive the rare bugs I ran into (getting stuck inside of an object, etc).One feature that should be highlighted for a few sentences is the wonderful leveling component. You never have to grind levels, per se, but it's worth doing stuff to gain extra XP. That's because the unlocks are all incredibly useful. A player can infinitely heal with no cool-down, take down large foes with one button, and shoot guns while on a zipline. Every unlock feels worth it, and none of them are useless. This is a rare trait for a game to have, especially with the exceedingly annoying leveling component in \"Skyrim\" (sorry for name-dropping again, but it's really a good point of comparison.)Not only is the gameplay stellar, but everything looks darn good. The island is incredibly lush, but the compounds and towns look suitably third-world. Characters models are very detailed and unique, even the NPCs that populate towns. Weapons are also very accurate to their real-world counterparts, and the modifications you make to them definitely make a difference to both their appearance and behaviors. All-in-all, this a very pretty game, and one that is always a joy to explore and learn more about.Which brings me to perhaps my only complaint about this game: the music. The main theme is excellent and powerful, and some pieces of background music get your pulse pumping. But the majority of the music is incredibly derivative dubstep, and it feels like the accomplished composer was forced to shoehorn it in so it would sell. One particularly bad track has a awful Skrillex/Damien Marley Jr. collaboration, which was enough to make me mute the music while playing it. It was supposed to fit in with the otherwise fun mission (torching pot fields with a flamethrower), but I think it would have been much better to include, oh I dunno, some actual reggae.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Simply brilliant","reviewText":"Anyone who experienced Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic on the original XBox has been eagerly anticipating Mass Effect.  Developed by KOTOR creators BioWare, Mass Effect may get off to a bit of a bumpy start, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be in for a real treat with this action/RPG.  Playing as Commander Shepard, you are in the middle of interstellar and political turmoil in what turns out to be one of the most engrossing and intelligent stories to grace a video game, well, maybe ever.  Without giving too much away, you'll meet tons of imaginitive alien races in an even more imaginitive universe that is brilliantly realized to say the least.  The RPG elements are where Mass Effect really shines brightest, as you customize Shepard and decide your actions.  Here you just don't pick from a list of replies or orders like usual in the RPG world, but when you do pick, your character actually thinks them out.  Little touches and elements like this are what sets Mass Effect apart from other RPG's to hit the XBox 360.  Where the game also shines is with it's visuals and effects, not to mention the incredibly good voice acting and dialogue.  The production values are incredibly high as well, and there's just a feeling of freshness to be found here that usually isn't in most games of Mass Effect's ilk.  However, Mass Effect isn't without it's flaws.  There are some moments of graphical slowdown that while not overly apparent, can still be noticable.  Also, the enemy AI isn't particularly good, and the game's action elements are nowhere near as polished as the RPG elements.  Those flaws aside, Mass Effect is still an incredible game that is a simply brilliant sight to behold.  The story alone is enough to suck you in, and you will be playing for quite some time.  Even if you're not an RPG fan, you should still give Mass Effect a look, you will not regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000G82KU4","description":"Created by Raven Software, Marvel : Ultimate Alliance lets you control the biggest, most powerful Super Hero alliance the world has ever known. Choose from heroes like Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Elektra, to form and customize a four-member strike force.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Marvel Ultimate Alliance is worth the buy","reviewText":"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance tells the struggle of a large group of various Marvel super heroes that have come together as they chase and battle both highly recognized and fairly unknown enemies in an attempt to foil Dr. Doom's ultimate plan for world domination: to steal the god Odin's powers and use them for evil.If you ever played X-Men: Legends then you'll get the right idea for this game. You pick a group of up to 4 mutants from a pool of about 25 heroes that include the X-Men, Avengers, and run around a level meleeing enemies or blasting them with projectiles, collecting S.H.I.E.L.D credits which are used to help level up your skills and make your outfit stronger (there are 4 costumes for each character you can unlock and some of them are pretty cool while others are dumb), solving small puzzles, playing mini-games that require you to press a certain button that pops up on screen, and collecting items. The items you collect can be used to enhance your character such as adding strength or focus, unlock bonus levels called \"Comic Missions\" where you play as a certain character in a situation that resembles a comic that character was in, unlock concept art, and unlock loading screens. Additionally there are bonus objectives such as saving data from a computer, rescuing Odin, and others that will give you both experience points and will affect your ending. So pay attention to the objectives.Also when you meet certain criteria such as finding 5 action figures or beating all the Comic Missions you can unlock hidden characters like Daredevil, Black Panther or Silver Surfer. While in-game you can find Ghost Rider, Dr. Strange, Nick Fury & Blade.Oh I forgot to mention that in each \"safe zone\" such as Stark Towers there are these trivia computers that give you free experience points for each question you answer right about the Marvel universe... and trust me its not really all that easy for newbie comic readers once you get into the higher levels.The high replay value stems from the amount of things to collect, the leveling up of each character, finding the hidden characters and it's online abilities. Thats right - you and 3 others can play through the entire campaign working together or go into \"Arcade\" mode and compete for the highest score for that level. Its pretty fun and rather interesting to see where others are at in the game when they need help and set up a co-op server.The best part of this game, in my opinion, was when you're in MurderWorld and you have to play a version of the old Atari version of the original Pitfall. Easily one of the best reasons to play Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.The X-Box 360 achievements are easy to earn in this game for the most part. It really just requires you to play through the game to get most of them but then there are a few like unlocking heroes or throwing enemies off ledges or performing finishing moves.. trust me, they are easy.Graphically speaking, Ultimate Alliance is so-so. The levels are nicely detailed and the character models of the super heroes and villians look great but when you go up close to other characters they look blocky and muddled. Glactus looked deisel.But no game comes without flaws. For starters the sound effects fade in and out during cutscenes. For example you'll see an explosion but won't hear anything. Secondly, a good majority of the dialouge is in text boxes without voices (dont get me wrong, sometimes they talk but not all the time). Secondly, your allies AI is just bad - you can command them to be on the defensive or offensive but no matter what you tell them to do they will still run after enemies and get their faces pounded. The worst example of this is in the Comic Missions where you have to protect someone cause if they die then the mission ends but all they do is run into harms way. Finally, the camera can sometimes just randomly change spots which can be quite awkward and frustrating at times.Overall, Ultimate Alliance is definitley a game worth owning because there is so much to do, its fun playing as and facing a wide variety of Marvel characters, it lengthy, not TOO hard, and it's online capabilities is fun. Not to mention there are quite a few endings pending on the bonus objectives you complete. I give it an 8.4 for everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}

To be honest, I bought this game as a filler between Fallout 3 (awesome) and RE5 (so-so) after reading all the positive reviews.  I've had more fun playing this game than any other game in a long time.  First of all, it looks and sounds great.  The visuals are outstanding.  It is a survival/horror game that is actually very scary at times, especially at the beginning when you really don't know what to expect.  The spaceship you're on is dark and creepy and the sounds the ship makes as you're exploring really add to the atmosphere.  The game has a tutorial feature that runs while you're playing, so you get used to the controls quickly.  The story is interesting.  The monsters are hideous creatures that require different methods to kill them.  You have the ability to use 'stasis' which will slow the monsters down, similar to 'bullet time'.  It is a really neat effect.  You can also use 'kinesis' which will allow you to pick up objects with your mind and throw them at enemies.  You can go in to areas with zero gravity, another neat effect.  I heartily recommend this game.  It has come down in price and you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2009"}

It has a simple concept behind it yet the game keeps you hooked for months.  If you love designing and creating, this IS the game for you as it's basically a layman's theme park builder.  For those that did play the first game, I have a small warning for you:  Unless you're hopelessly addicted to the first game and its many expansions, you probably won't get much out of the sequel.  It's almost a carbon copy of the first game.  Some of the rollercoaster building mechanics have changed, there are new attractions, and you can now play on maps that are realistic portrayals of the popular Six Flags theme park chain.  Other than that, everything is the same, even the graphics (which are usually the first thing to get updated in a sequel) don't look any different.  My recommendation for anyone that is the patient type and wishes to buy this game is to wait a month or two.  There are already two expansions for the sequel.  Games like these are quickly packaged into bargain combo packs and I imagine it won't be long before both expansions are available with the original game at a low price.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2003"}

There are a lot of awful cars that are hard to drive and flying airplanes is again an difficult skill to master. It does seem, however, that the lower police ratings are easier to lose which makes up for some of the other aggravation.I have not yet seen the end of the game but I am just amazed with the depth and for any fan of the series this is a must have.

Then plug the adapter into the controller.  Next, plug the headset into the adapter (or else the adapter won&#8217;t turn on).  Connect the USB cable between the controller and the Xbox console.  NOTE:  You need Xbox Live so you can ensure your console firmware is up to date.  After the installation is done, you can reinsert your  controller batteries.  You do not have to configure all your controllers at the same time, but you do need to set them up at some point, if you want to use them with the XO Four head set.The adapter has several buttons, which are easy to reach and now sit at the bottom of your controller.  Mute, Volume Up/Down, and Chat/Game Volume Balance.You canm of course, plug the headset into a mobile device.  To do so, you remove the detachable boom mic, and plug the headset cable into your mobile device.  The cable is 3 feet long.The XO Four is about as comfortable as other gaming headsets with padded earcups.  They weigh a little over 10 ounces.  The headband is leather and the cups are surfaced in a soft mesh.  I have worn them for about three hours of play at a clip and they don&#8217;t bother me.As far as sound quality.  These have 50mm speakers with 20 Hz &#8211; 20kHz response.  The mic is rated at 100 Hz &#8211; 10 kHz.  The sound is excellent and provides a nice full audio experience for your game.  Higher sounds are crips and clear, and the bass is nice and deep, and game sounds seem to explode around you.Turtle Beach backs the XO four with a 1 year warranty.I would recommend these as a very good headset.  You can upgrade to the XO Seven, but I think the differences are a breakaway cable (for a mobile device jack), and memory foam ear cups. That&#8217;s a personal decision as to if those are worth the extra $45 or so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0000A09EP","description":"Join Mario and Luigi as they team up in a strange new land for an action-packed quest to retrieve Princess Peach's stolen voice.","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Pure joy","reviewText":"I have a theory about games like these. My theory is that their developers have secret access to a mysterious element called Happy, which they tuck into the microchip before shipping the game. This causes the strange effect of players not being able to cease smiling as they play the game. I have fallen under the effects of Happy, and here's why.I loved the look of this game. Clear, sharp, and colorful, with gorgeous animation. I highly reccomend that you play it on a DS or GBA SP, as the extra light heightens the graphics to glorious levels.The battle system is wonderful. You may not be able to believe that the superb Paper Mario combat system would translate well to a handheld, but ah, how wrong you'd be. Timing the button presses takes concentration, but is never frustrating or boring. You can use hammers, jumps, or even magical powers to attack, as well as an array of fun items.Then there are the puzzles. This is where the Happy element is in its strongest form. As you progress in the game, you'll earn new abilities, and each and every one will help you solve the near-perfect puzzles. Use your hammer to whack the brother in front of you into the ground...light your partner's pants on fire to make him dash...or jump on his head to reach a high ledge. Whatever it is you have to do, it always makes sense. For this reason, I would reccomend playing without a strategy guide, since using one would ruin the fun of figuring the puzzles out.The story, which is beautiful in its simplicity, has many twists and turns, so you never know what you might be doing next. One minute you could be hunting for beans to make Yoshis lay eggs, and the next you might be strategically using your hammer to help a fashion designer dye her clothes. This keeps the game fresh and exciting at every turn.RPG elements are integrated masterfully. You can gain experience, level up, and even buy new equipment. These features add to the game, but never become a pain.From the beginning, which features Mario running around in his underwear, to the end sequence, wherein Bowser is tied to the back of a plane in a gigantic gift box, this game is pure joy. So play it already. Feel the Happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2005"}

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It has a decent selection of games but most of them lean toward younger children, that is the way Nintedo has always been and will always be, but that's great for the kids. They often have 3rd party's censor their games to not include themes that may be to mature for the younger audience. This is a great move to protect children, but if you're older, it does get annoying. If you're a bit older, and looking for some mature games that aren't geared torward the pre-10-12 year old crowd, the system has a few but very little in that category, maybe a handful or more. GC lacks heavy 3rd party support and the little it does have, make a few mature titles but are usually quick cash ins with little substance, such as Capcom's recent announcements. But there are a couple good ones to be found, just very miniscule compared to the other consoles on the market.The system itself is very small, and that's great for fitting it in tight spaces. Very durable as well. The system doesn't play DVD movies or music CD's though, just a special mini disc that play the games for the system. And because the disc are smaller, it has less storage space, so some GC games often include less content that the versions of the same game on other consoles. If you want a great game console that plays games, DVD's and CD's, then this isn't what you're looking for, you'd be better with a PS 2 in that case.The gamepad is great though. Very comfortable but the button layout is a bit akward for certain games, but overall it's good. It also has 4 gamepad ports so 4 player games are definitely fun. But it does not include a modem, harddrive and the memory cards have very little save space that get filled up quickley with certain games, so expect to buy many memory cards down the road.The graphics and sound are also impressive, and most games have very fast load times. The system does not have an optical(toslink) output like the PS 2 does, but it is capable of prologicII whch sounds great, although not quite as nice as DTS/5.1.Overall, a nice system, but limited in terms of features such as DVD, CD, and 5.1 playback and also very limited in variety of games, and mostly geared toward children. It also does not have an online structure, so you will not be playing games online for quite awhile if at all. But it is perfect for a child that just wants a bare bones console that has some excellent and fun games for their age.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0088MVP3S","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Missing that \"it\" factor","reviewText":"For starters, I liked Lord of Shadows 2, but I didn't love it. There was nothing about the game that really annoyed me, but I was always waiting for that missing piece to &#34;pull me in&#34;, as so to speak. I don't necessarily agree with all of the criticism that's been aimed at this game, but one overall point has been pretty much unanimous - it's not as good as the first LOS.Combat - I'll attempt to make an analogy here. How would you feel if you had a brand new sports car, but you weren't allowed to take it on the freeway to see what it could REALLY do? Well, that's how I feel about the combat in LOS 2. There are so many interesting combos and attacks to purchase, but don't expect to be able to use many of them. Unlike the last game, it's a free roaming camera, and I initially thought that was great. However, it'll be used against you. While engaging in battle, you better keep your head on a swivel! You'll be in mid combo, when all of the sudden, someone will come behind you and break up your combat attempt. The other issue is that most of the enemies are heavily armoured, or have some type of protective shield. You'll need to get very creative when attacking some of these enemies, and it gets pretty old. Here's my formula when judging combat: If I look forward to fighting bad guys, that means the combat is pretty fun. If I cringe at the sheer thought of having to fight a room full of enemies, that means there's a problem. With LOS 2, it was the latter. Like I said, you'll be presented with a boatload of fancy combos, but you won't be able to pull off most of them.Weaponry - I actually enjoyed the weapons, and I felt they were all completely different from each other. The main weapon is the blood whip, and Its formed from Dracula's own blood. There are two other weapons, created from ice and fire, respectively. The ice weapon (a sword) actually replenishes your health with every successful strike, and I think that's pretty neat. The fire weapon (chaos claws) can be used to penetrate armour, but the meter runs out much too quickly. There are a couple other secondary weapons, but I didn't use them for much of anything. I thought the weaponry was nice (if only the combat equaled the weapons).Enemies - Wow, maybe the first game set the standards too high? You know what, I'm going to start with a good aspect first. The boss battles were freaking phenomenal!!! Dare I say the boss fights were better than the first game, and that's saying a lot. During the last 2 or 3 hours or so of the game, I swear there were 5 or 6 boss battles, and they all felt like they were back to back (which is a good thing, by the way). I don't want to leave the impression that the non-boss bad guys were subpar, because they really weren't. It's just that the bar has been set so high, so I had unrealistic expectations I suppose. Many of them looked the same, and they were all kinda uninspiring. The boss battles are the meat and potatoes of LOS 2, trust me.Miscellaneous - Haha, I almost completed the review without addressing the most polarizing featuring of the game - The stealth missions. I'm in the minority here, I absolutely loved these! These were the closest thing to a puzzle that the game had to offer. Stealth missions probably made up less than 5% of the game, so they're not really that big of a deal. I enjoyed them because they were a fun change of pace. This is more of an open world game than it's predecessor, so there's definitely some exploration to be had. I really took my time, and I finished right at the 34 hour mark, very similar to LOS 1.I know my review may have had somewhat of a negative undertone to it, but I did enjoy my experience, for the most part. There are quite a few neat elements to the game. But I had to deduct a star because there was no it factor (and the difficult combat didn't help). Please understand this is the kind of game that takes a looooong time before it starts rolling. If you're patient and open to change, you'll definitely like this one. The problem being, when I pre-order a game, I expect to love it, not just like it. I refuse to give a 5 star rating to a game that lacks that all important 'it factor'. Dante's Inferno, you're up next!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2014"}

S.","summary":"Comparing LOTRO to other MMORPGs...","reviewText":"The most important thing to know about LOTRO when comparing it:  This game brings nothing new to the MMORPG realm other than its quirks and theme.To some (like myself), this will be enough to interest you.  After playing a multitude of MMORPGs (including WoW), I've concluded that the core fun factor to these games is progression.  I like it, but I can't progress without a fresh world to explore.  This is why I appreciate LOTRO.  It's a fresh world to explore, with its own very popular theme, style, and expected MMORPG content with few innovative quirks. It offers a deep MMORPG experience with its strong music, pleasant visuals, and familiar themes.  In some ways the LOTR theme seems skewed and contradictory to the gameplay.  This is a major issue for the theme, but it still remains a moderately entertaining grounds for a game.To others, this game will be just another boring MMORPG exercise because, as I stated before, nothing new is offered by this MMORPG other than its quirks and theme.  I might even say that this MMORPG is lacking in content as compared to other MMORPGs, as it has a lacking PvP system and some other common MMORPG conventions.  In the end, it will be up to you to balance between the worth of generic MMMORPG content and the popular LOTRO theme.Until then, I'll be in Middle Earth.  =)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2008"}

This steel beast once fought for its country, but during a dangerous mission it drifted into an ice trap that slowly froze to death every living thing on board. A routine investigation quickly turns into a battle for survival against both the freezing elements and the terrifying evil that inhabits the lost ship.  Cryostasis takes players on a terrifying trip into the unknown as they explore the dark, frozen, claustrophobic corridors and unlock the shocking secrets of the North Wind.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A creepy game, but lacks a good story","reviewText":"The Good: Great atmosphere, clever enemy design, looks amazingThe Bad: Super slow pacing throughout, lots of glitches, requires monster rig to run, needs better shooting mechanics, can be really hard at times, story is hard to followI love first person shooters with great atmosphere and Cryostasis pulls this off well. While the story is pretty confusing and never really makes any sense at all (even at the end) you at least know why you're here. You are moving through a Russian nuclear ice breaker that was destroyed after hitting an iceberg (sound familiar). You walk around finding dead bodies and upon touching them you can relive the moments leading to their death and try and prevent it so you can continue getting through the area that is blocked. This also provides more back story on how the ship actually did hit the iceberg and why.The game is a first person shooter so you get some guns, but the game is slow paced and not a high octane shooter like most people like. You move very slowly and you have to take your time aiming since these guns don't exactly fire at a high rate. You get several different types such as bolt action rifles, a tommy gun, a water cannon (that uses icicles!), and even a flare gun. The aiming is slow like I mentioned and you just feel like your shooting in slow motion. This isn't entirely bad since you can take your time and aim because ammo is a tad scarce. You do, however, never feel like your guns are very powerful even on the weaker enemies. But you don't get guns right away since for a good 25% through the game you get to use melee weapons.The enemies in the game are pretty unique and not just average cannon fodder. These enemies are pretty creepy and look great and behave decently towards your actions. Some swing axes and some shoot back, but they are all pretty hard to take down especially the bigger guys later on.The game doesn't really consist of puzzles but the game is a linear maze some times. You do flip switches an activate heat sources (more on that later), but there's no actual puzzles in the game. This game makes things a bit dull and feel monotonous since the tone of the game never really changes and even the atmosphere wears thin before the end. You're opening a lot of doors, flipping a lot of switches, and shooting some bad guys and that's about it. This game is really only for people who are into atmosphere and story.You can use any heat source such as lamps, lights, heaters, fires, you name it to recharge your health. There are two meters and the outer one shows how warm the room is or the heat source. You can only heal up to where that meter stops, and then you have your endurance gauge for sprinting.The game looks pretty good and you need a monster rig to run this with DirectX10 and get the best looking settings. The textures are highly detailed, and you can even watch the ice melt and watch the water run down walls in real time. Of course this was one of the very first DX10 games so there are plenty of glitches. The PS4.0 has a problem making animations jerky so you have to fiddle around with minimizing to the desktop and changing it from 3 to 4 to get it to stop. The game will crash at random some times, and there is some weird out of no where glitches throughout. This makes the game very frustrating to play even if you have a hefty rig.The game can feel like a chore towards the end because the pace never changes and is just deliberately slow and the story just never makes sense. However, it has something about it that makes you keep playing regardless of all this, but people who like fast action should stay away. Cryostasis could have been a lot better with a more stable engine, better shooting, and a more steady pace instead of just slow throughout. If you have the rig to the run this game and the patience then Cryostasis is your thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007VFHGZ4","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Made me a franchise convert","reviewText":"I'll say it straight up: I was very hesitant to get this game simply on account of it being a Tomb Raider title. I've given the series a go before- actually put a serious effort into playing it- and I've just never been able to get into it. Quite frankly, after playing through most of TR: Anniversary and TR 4 (couldn't finish either) I really couldn't understand why the series had so many fans. Maybe it was a console thing, with all the QTEs and jumping around endless ledges. I liked ledge jumping too in Super Mario Bros, but I can't stand it on the PC. Aside from obviously just being straight PC ports, the games were downright boring in a lot of ways- tons of backtracking, looking for various hidden items and switches, heavy on puzzles and light on action. I mean seriously, why doesn't this chick just bring some dynamite along for those pesky doors?! Speaking of which- and I know this may construe blasphemy- I have never found the Lara Croft character to be particularly attractive. She looks like a short Barbie doll with guns. In fact I think this even carried on to the movies, where Angelina Jolie actually looked less attractive playing the character than she did in her other films.But enough of that: suffice to say that TR 2013 has changed my entire perspective on the series. I heard enough good things about it that I decided it was worth one more try, and I'm glad I did it.First of all, it's very fast-paced compared to its predecessors and combat is visceral and actually takes a modicum of skill on the player's part. No more just locking targets and mashing the fire button until it goes down, or QTEing everything to death. You can take cover, dodge, dash, snipe, and melee. It plays a lot more like a shooter in that regard, and you get experience rewards for downing foes in more spectacular ways (which alone are worth it just to watch). There are still QTEs but they're not nearly as prevalent and are actually fun rather than frustrating. There's still puzzles but they actually make sense now and are fun- not requiring ridiculous backtracking through mazes to find various items to get some door-opening gizmo to work. Many utilize the game's physics and there's enough hints to keep you going without handholding. You thus feel like you actually accomplished something and at the same time are unlikely to get stuck.There are typical weapons and gear, but they're upgradeable and the upgrades actually matter- not just adding more damage. You get progressively more advanced weapons as you proceed, and each has new abilities- some of which are unlocked for free as story events and some of which you need to spend salvage to buy. Either way, it's actually fun using the different weapon modes, and combined with Lara's level up skills they make you seriously more lethal.The environment can be used to your benefit, both for cover and to mess up your enemies with exploding barrels or physics. Hit a guy who's on a rope, you might not kill him outright but the fall will. A lot of barricades are now actually destructible, and yes- you can pack explosives. There's often more than one way to get to goals, so if you really want to do it the hard way you can always do that too. Most of all, the environments are gorgeous and full of hidden goodies- everything ranging from ammo to animals you can hunt for extra exp/salvage. There's hidden optional tombs scattered around the island, collection sets, and sniper nests where you can pick off hapless NPCs with silenced weapons while they mill about below.Enemies are varied, with different tactics and weapons. They actually act reasonably intelligent and don't spawn out of nowhere. Shoot at them, they'll take cover. Hit one of them with a silenced weapon and his buddies will go looking for you. And by the way, they have explosives too and have no problem unloading them on you. They patrol in the large open-world areas and you are fully able and equipped to play ninja. It's actually a lot of fun, and you're rewarded for it too. That said, if you prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around, you can just gun them all down. Headshots get you extra exp too, and in general there's plenty of exp to go around.Best of all, however, the story is compelling and the game is realistic enough (especially graphically) to give you a serious sense of danger and urgency. This is especially the case at the beginning where you start with almost nothing, but it keeps you going throughout the game. The overall game is a bit short if you just do the main quest and skip all collections and optional tombs, but it's long enough to be satisfying. Jumping across falling, flaming bridges and sliding through collapsing, exploding mines is the norm here- and it's intense enough to really keep you on your toes.Lastly, this Lara is different from the others. I guess she hasn't hit puberty yet or something, but she's not... huge. Anyone who's played any of the other TR games will know what I mean. She actually looks like a real person and you sympathize with both her quest and her friends. When she gets injured, you care about patching her up- not just because your health bar is low and there's a pack of raptors charging down the tunnel at you, and the last autosave was 10 minutes ago. On that note, the game doesn't look like a dumbed-down console port and the autosave does work very well. I never had to replay a huge part of the game due to dying.This game has actually made me a fan of the TR series, which I'd have said was flatly impossible last year. No other game has changed my opinion so dramatically on a franchise. Don't get me wrong- I'm not about to go buy all the old games and try them again, but if this is any indication of what is to come I'll stay a fan","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"Me and my kids luv this game, we got the xbox 360 and PS3 and the HI DEF graphics are nice but for serious fun we pop in the serious Sam, even though its an older orig xbox game the graphics and game play along with the weapons and action is really good.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"D. C. Obraztsov","summary":"Definite improvement","reviewText":"This is my favorite in the series so far.GRAPHICS - okay, wow.  Maybe it's not a big improvement (they've always been great), but the setting is just beautiful.  Boston is a great place to have AC - everything looks so realistic and you'll just get lost running around in the beautiful city and the woods....sometimes things are a little glitchy, like for several entire sequences I noticed a character was talking but his mouth wasn't moving at all.GAMEPLAY - I love being able to hunt, use a tomahawk, a gun (yeah, makes you realize how terrible quality guns were back then), naval warfare, and I really like the new Anvil game engine.  It's just a fresh start and I feel like it was a step in the right direction for this franchise.  Since this the fifth in the series, something has to change a bit so it doesn't go stale, I suppose.  The game is challenging, no doubt, but not incredibly difficult.  It's a good medium.  Not being able to change difficulty settings is a bummer for some people, but I think it's fair.  It's definitely not a breeze, but you shouldn't feel suicidal either.I noticed someone mentioned slow load times.  For me I noticed how FAST the load times were.  It's not like Skyrim or anything, where I can do homework during load times.  It's definitely speedy.  Might want to go delete some save files or clear some space off your PS3 if it's loading super slow for you.STORYLINE - I love, love the storyline.  I'll admit, it starts out a little slow at first...you play as the main character's father for awhile, and you get to watch the story of how you were born (sort of). Then you become the kid, Connor, who leaves his Native American tribe to learn more about the Templar symbols.  I think the story between Connor's parents is truly interesting and I feel a lot of attachment to the overall storyline. You also get to meet some famous people, like Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams.  If you're someone who really needs instant gratification and wants to start killing people immediately non-stop (have a friend who says it looks *boring* - what?) then this game isn't for you.  There's plenty of bloody assassinations and cool scenes, but it's a really involving game in a huge world that has a lot more features than just killing people.There's been some controversy about this game being \"anti-american\" or \"anti-British.\"  Please, it's a good game, and it makes people on BOTH sides look like a jerk for the most part.  Here's an excerpt from the description of the Boston Massacre:\"One of the interesting things about the massacre is what happened afterward - that is, how both sides tried to spin it to their advantage.  The fact that most people call it a 'Massacre' should give you some idea of who won this particular PR war.  Revolutionaries portrayed it as an attack on Colonial liberties, and images of the event (popularized by Paul Revere), showed an organized British force firing into the crowd - not a confused group of soldiers cornered by an angry mob.  The British, on the other hand, referred to the event 'The Incident on King Street.'  We're naturally calm in a crisis - unlike countries who insist on turning every minor confrontation into a three-ring circus.  Anyway, the wigmaker dropped his prices and it never happened again.  I call it a victory for the bald.\"LOCATION/SETTING - I love the setting.  I find it hugely interesting to learn more about this era, and AC is always educational on top of being fun (if you choose).  Reading the Animus Database is definitely educational and of course humor is interjected into the entries to make it less dry.  Being able to fight in the American Revolution is just undoubtedly fun.NOT PLAYING PREVIOUS GAMES - I've played the previous games, but you can play this without needing to do so.  You'll be a little confused at first, but you can figure it out or just look up on wiki the general premise of Templars, the animus, Desmond, Ezio, etc. so you know what they're talking about when it comes up.  UPDATE:  The more I play, the more and more they talk about story lines from past games when you play as Desmond.  You should probably play past games or read quite a bit of wiki if you want to understand the game better.  It just depends on how much you care.  However, you obviously won't be nearly as confused playing as Connor.This game is just so beautiful, so intriguing, so much fun - that I totally dropped all other games I was playing when this one came in the mail, and I can't seem to play anything else.  Beautiful, intriguing, challenging, mysterious...and you're a badass assassin to top it all off.  What more could you want from a game?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0030HM2WO","description":"Amazon.com Product Description","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"This is what G1 fans have been waiting on for over 25 years","reviewText":"Like many thirty-something American males today, I grew up loving absolutely everything about the Transformers.  I'd trudge my way through the Bozo show just to watch a 15 minute segment of the original animated series.  I'd ask for a Transformers toy at every occasion when a present was coming to me.  They were without a doubt the coolest toys I'd ever seen, and the Transformers characters and lore absolutely captivated my young imagination like nothing else ever had.  I'd never cried in a movie theater before, until I saw Optimus Prime die in the original Transformers movie that hit theaters in 1986.Unfortunately, in the many years after the Transformers of my youth (Generation 1, or G1) faded away into many subsequent versions that bore little resemblance to their earliest incarnation, G1 fans have been left with little more than new DVD reissues of the original animated series to indulge in their nostalgia.  The earliest word of the new Transformers movies offered hope, but those turned out to be among the most disappointing products Hollywood has ever produced.  But in 2010, the buzz was getting around that a relatively young development studio, High Moon Studios, was releasing a new Transformers game was not only steeped in the world of the original Transformers, but that was going to tell the much-pondered origin story of the war on Cybertron, which eventually ended up forcing the Transformers on their journey to Earth, which is where the animated series started.  Finally, after completing this game, I can confirm that this is what G1 fans all over the world have been waiting for.This is Generation 1 Transformers through and through.  Sure, the Transformers look a little different than they used to, but this is an improvement that was made only for the better.  The character models start from their original, basic look, and are given some more intricate, modern upgrades that do enough just to keep it fresh, but without going overboard like the Michael Bay character models.  Cybertron is reborn as an amazing game world...an intricate metropolis of corridors, towers, computers, elevators, and ruins.  Many voice talents from the original animated series were brought back for this game, and the new voice actors do a phenomenal job of making the characters sound just like they did back in the day.  As far as mood goes, the developers nailed it.  This is a genuine trip back into the world of the original Transformers.Much like the gameNIER, this is a game that if you can really immerse yourself into the game world, characters, and the story, it makes it very easy to overlook gameplay that is imperfect, but still very competent.  At its core, this game is a 3rd person shooter utilizing the Unreal 3 engine.  It can be repetitive at times, particularly at times when you're moving from one place to another and not actively working on an objective.  The transformations into vehicle form, while quite fun to just mess around with, doesn't serve a whole lot of purpose in terms of the gameplay, and controlling the vehicles can feel a bit stiffer than it should.  But again, for you G1 fans, there are some moments in this game that will just send you over the moon.  A battle with Soundwave, incredible boss fights against Omega Supreme and Trypticon (yes, there's both Autobot AND Decepticon campaigns here), a ride on the back of a \"resident\" of the Cyberton core, and just the little lines of dialogue that will transport you right back to your childhood....these moments really make the game something special.  Not to mention the excellent story (which Hasbro as anointed as official lore in the Transformers canon) that reveals many great moments, such as Starscream and Megatron's first meeting, how Optimus becomes the next Prime and acquires the Matrix, and how the war for Cybertron escalated into a planetwide conflict that changes the fate of the Transformers forever.I can say with confidence, that this game is an absolute must-have if you are a fan of the original G1 Transformers.  This is that piece of entertainment that you've been waiting for all this time.  To those of you who are younger, aren't a fan, or are just looking for a shooter to play, you can probably find better options.  But make no mistake, this is a very solid game all around, and the fact that this is the first true Generation 1 Transformers in decades, propels it into something truly special.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00024W1U6","description":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne is a continuation of the popular role-playing series, set in our modern world. It's an average day, as a typical Japanese high school student goes to the hospital, for a visit with his sick teacher. While on the train, he gets a mysterious vision that the Apocalypse is coming. Arriving at the hospital, the boy is sucked into a Vortex Field, into a dark mirror-image of his world. When he learns our world is ending to make room for this new one, he'll do what he can to get back home and (hopefully) stop the Apocalypse.","reviewerName":"L. J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"Demon Haunted World","reviewText":"Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne is an innovative RPG for the patient and hardcore only. Considering that this is an Atlus game and I am writing this about two years after the games release, this game has become a rare collectors item. Look forward to paying list price for a ex-rental copy with no case or manuel, so think hard before making the investment. I can not emphasize enough that it is hard to wrestle this lengthy beast of game into submission.If you can get past the difficulty level, people who are able to comit themselves to learning how to take advantage of the complex battle system will be well rewarded. Nocturne takes place in a ruined shell of modern day Tokyo. An evil cultist has destroyed the world in a cataclysm called the Conception. By a twist of fate, the nameless protagonist manages to survive. As he wakes up in a hospital, he discovers that he has been transformed into a demi-fiend, a being with a human soul but the apparance and strength of a demon. He'll need it, because Tokyo has become a supernatural way-station for monsters and ghosts as they wait the rebirth of the world. The few surviving humans and monsters have split into factions, all fighting for the privilege of ascending to Kagutsuchi, the demon moon, and remaking the world anew according to their own desires. In the story, it is up to you to decide if you want to join a faction or not. The ending depends on the choices the player makes.It may sound like the story gives you a lot of freedom, but it really doesn't. It is actually very linear with only a few side-quests throughtout. However, the fighting system is were you see an abnormal amount of freedom for a J-RPG. The player only starts out with his avatar, the demi-fiend. After that, the player must start recruiting enemy monsters into his party. This is accomplished by striking up a conversation while on the battlefield. Every enemy character in the game is ultimately recruitable, however some enemies like bosses can not be bargained with. In that case, the only way to get some of the best demons is by fusing two or more allies together at the Cathedral of Shadows.However, level is not everything in Nocturne. Instead, victory depends on mastering the press-turn system. Each character has up to eight skills it can retain. It also has innate strengths and weaknesses to some types of skills. If you hit on an enemy weakpoint, you gain an extra turn. If the enemy is immune to the attack, you lose one. Your enemies also work under this system. Have the right skills and the immunities and the battle is yours. Have the the wrong team in the wrong dungeon, and prepare to be wipped out. Nocturne can be frustrating in that regard, because it take quite a bit of time to tweak your party to be just right.However, there are times that Nocturne just doesn't seem to play fair. For only thing, if the main character falls in battle, the game is automatically over. About half way through the bosses all learn a spell that replentishes it number of attacks per turn. Demon allies learn only one ability per level-up, and they gain levels at a much slower rate than the main character.Let's talk about Nocturne's technical qualities. This is a visually stunning game. It may not have the most cutting edge of graphics, but this is a case of style triumphing over technical prowess. Rendered in a cel-shades style, the game mixes cool pastels and burning neons to create a world that is visually beautiful, off-kilter, and a little creepy too. It's all complimented with some wonderful music that blends contemporary sounds with some elements to make it just a little frightening.However, the one real flaw with Nocturne is this is just not a replayable game. One play through will take at least sixty hours, and it has such a steep difficulty curve that the prospect of playing it again probably won't be appealing to most. Trust me, I am not one of those people who can only play a game one. I tried to play Nocturne again, and I realized my heart wasn't in it. However, I have played its superior follow up Digital Devil Saga three times already.Despite everything, Nocturne is not a game that should be missed by any serious RPG fan. It is truly a one of kind experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2006"}

Is this my favorite RE game is the question. I still think the original RE1 was my favorite then follow by the huge RE4.  This series has changed over the time.  I felt compel to write this base on a bias review from a 360 fan boy, who said the PS3 version has lag, it doesn't, or if you have cheap computer hardware, maybe.  I have a new d-link n router with QoS, but I do a hard-wire to the PS3, grant I got the 20 GB version.  I play 75% of the time on on-line co-op and think it is a fresh experience to the game.  This game looks and has the same feels and hue of Metal Gear Solid 4 in the early round; the yellowish desert town in the beginning.  I think the graphic is much better than MGS4.What new:Well the online co-op is the main thing.  I am not sure which of the two character, Chris or Sheva the other person actually plays.  People usually join my game for a chapter or so and they are Sheva.  Maybe I am Sheva to them? (updated they are Sheva)  This game moves very fast with online play.  I don't sense the weapons differentiate themselves as much as they used to.  A pistol was useless in the late round of the previous game, but is still useful here.  Curtain weapons were used on curtain enemy in RE4, most weapons here can be used on anybody, just the firepower level in RE5.Camera is improved from RE4.  As a person who gets dizzy from quick FPS game with the jerky camera, RE5 is much smoother than 4.  You use both analog stick here.  The L analog is the move and the right analog is turning your head.  With some combos, you can do a quick turn and the camera moves much better.  I couldn't play RE4 for more than 2 hours.  I did 6 hours last night on 5, with less dizziness.There is a gunner chapter of the game which is a little tough, but is much easier with co-op.  Actually the is game is easier with co-op play.What is different:Well it is not a survival horror anymore, just not scary at all.  There was a little in RE4, but the formula has been removed.  This is all action and the puzzles are weak, just a few keys to open a few door.  I do like the RE1 to 3 Code Veroncia because of the puzzle.  The in-game item chest is gone, but you can collect items and dump them between chapters in the inventory menu.  Game load fairly quick on the PS3 version.  Split screens in mercenaries mode with a friend is ok, the screens is split into two screens horitzonally and get smaller too.Overall I give this a 9.4 out of 10.  It is fun and worth the wait, but it isn't my favorite RE series game yet.  If you are an RE5 fan there is no reason to past this one at all.  The game is a lot shorter then RE4.  I recommend using the mic, which works fine, and is better then the get over here call.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game.

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"One of the best made FPS that still stands up today","reviewText":"Half Life 2 is the sequel to the highly fun and immersive, first person shooter, Half Life 1 where you are again Gordon Freeman.Since this is a first person shooter, let's talk about the guns. For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.Now let's talk about the gravity gun, which is a highly duplicated gun. Personally the gravity gun seems more cumbersome to use it as a weapon. Sure it has its fun moments throwing a saw blade or an explosive canister at enemies, but the aim is imperfect and you need to grab something, turn and shoot it, but it should only be used when you're out of ammo... or if you want to change your style of mayhem.The combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.The graphics are amazing and detailed (on the PC, the X-Box version can look muddy close up). Everything is a vista it looks so good. Textures are detailed, areas are detailed as you travel on your journey. Lighting is beautiful both with dark and flame or bright lights. In fact one enemy has an attack that is a blinding bright light.You really get a sense of distance traveled by this game. You aren't just put in levels that go here and there. This is a lot like a road trip where you span miles over the game. You see map locations and you travel through realistic areas whether they be ghettos, sewers, train yards, the west coast by the ocean in a car, abandon farms and down a river on a boat.Level design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean \"go here\" or characters will flat out say \"run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off.\"There are several very fun and memorable situations such as climbing under a massive bridge only to have something happen. A graveyard firefight at the side of a priest, a den of giant spiders (head crabs),The game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.Of course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.I've mentioned the game's immersion, just like the previous Half Life, characters and friendly people will talk to you with their voices and not in a cut scene. You can walk around as they talk to one another. Nothing is stiff or forced. Good voice acting, but I feel like the previous game was better and less long winded when their characters talk. I know I should be paying attention, but I get more fun when they speak and I'm jumping on their heads. The game makers like to brag about everything being motion captured, but to be honest I never notice that their motions look real, which could be the intention. So good you won't get taken out of the game by a stiff or animated or robotic like in the previous game.After getting several hours into the game and even playing through Half Life 1 and its expansions, I honestly don't know what's going on. I don't know how Gordon Freeman went from being in a complex fighting invading enemies to being in a city occupied by human soldiers. I feel like I missed a cut scene, and that really takes me out of the game, which they are really trying to keep you from being taken out.The game also really seems to stroke your ego a lot. You went from being one man who steps up to being the only man who can save them and you're the new messiah. All hail you Gordon Freeman. Stop telling me I'm so great and just tell me what I have to do. It makes me think everyone in the game wants me to help it move...The music is good and will show up at the right moments. It's nice. The sound is great and I never hear anything questionable or bad. Voice acting is great too.In all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Humorous, challenging, and FUN!","reviewText":"After playing Portal 1, I was instantly hooked.  I had no reservations whatsoever about purchasing Portal 2.  Portal 1 was fun in it's own right.  The basis of the game is to solve puzzles using a combination of physics, wit, and timing.  It's really hard to convey the gameplay into words, so the best thing I can say is, I'm the type who loves games like Angry Birds, so the challenge of Portal appealed instantly to me.  You have to rely on timing, proper placement of portals, and sometimes a lucky guess.  Portal 2 picks up where Portal 1 left off.  I don't want to spoil the plot, so I'll explain the concept.  Basically, in Portal 1, you played the role of a human lab rat.  You are trapped in a testing facility run by a menacing robot named GlaDOS.  GlaDOS starts out seeming innocent enough, but as the game progresses, you start to discover her true nature.  Throughout Portal 1, movements mainly relied on the portal gun, a device that shoots orange and blue worm holes.  You can only shoot the holes on certain surfaces, so you really have to focus on where to place the portals.  Not only can you use the portals to get to  different parts of the rooms you're in, you can also use the portals to do tricky maneuvers like jump over chasms or even attack and disable enemies.  Some of the cooler tricks with the portals is performing physics based maneuvers, like placing a portal on a very high wall and another on the floor.  You would then step into the portal on the floor, fall out of the portal up high back through the portal on the floor.  However, when you exit the portal up high, the momentum from the fall can be used to propel you across huge chasms and such.  The puzzles start out fairly easy, so beginners won't feel overwhelmed.  However, the puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses.  You also encounter different types of challenges and more menacing robots as the game progresses.  The best part of Portal is the extremely witty and sometimes hilarious moments throughout.  I found myself laughing pretty loudly on quite a few occasions.Portal 2 picks up where Portal 1 left off.  Like Portal 1, the levels are superbly designed and the graphics are top notch.  There are lush environments and the lighting, setting, and tone truly immerse you in the game.  Portal 2 is much deeper, longer, and challenging than its predecessor.  Portal 2 also introduces several new items to compliment the Portal gun.  There are things like propulsion gel, (which allows you to bounce off of it to pretty good heights), speed gel (which allows you to build up incredible momentum when you run on it), and a white gel that enables you to create a portal wherever it sticks.  There is also more dialogue on Portal 2, compared to Portal 1 which basically only featured GlaDOS speaking throughout the game.  The levels in Portal 2 are HUGE.  Even though it follows a linear path, there is enough openness to the game to keep you from feeling claustrophobic.  The game does a fantastic job of conveying the sensations of height and propulsion.  When you're a thousand feet above the ground on a ledge or small crevice, you really feel the sensation of height.  Portal 2 has dozens more puzzles than Portal 1.  There were a couple times when I thought the game was nearing the end, only to realize I was nowhere near the end.  Also in Portal 2, several new devices are added to the already fun buttons, lasers, and cubes used to solve puzzles in Portal 1.The save feature is one of the best.  Not only does it save automatically every time you complete a level, it saves in increments during levels.  If you pulled off a particularly tough maneuver or defeated a tough enemy and the characters dies before completing the level, you'll usually start where you left off or very close.  That saves tons of frustration, especially for casual gamers like myself.A lot is being made about the Steam account requirement.  I already had a Steam account, so it was no big deal for me.  I purchased the physical disk and it installed fine.  After installation, it automatically linked the game to my Steam account and that was all.  I wasn't forced to download the game from Steam as others have claimed.  Steam has it's advantages and drawbacks, but the former outweigh the latter for me.  I also like the fact that Steam allows you to play the game on as many computers as you wish (although, only one can be active at any given time).  My son (who's away at school) and I both take turns playing the game.  He didn't have a physical disk, so he did have to download it through Steam.  Another great aspect of Portal 2 is the multip-layer cooperative mode.  Not only can you play with partners online, you can also use the PC version to play with console players online, like users on a PS3.  In fact, if you purchase the PS3 version of the game, the PC/Mac version is included free!Portal 2 is a great game.  Even if you're not a hardcore gamer, you will definitely love the challenge, the humor, and the overall feel of Portal 2.  I do strongly suggest playing Portal 1 beforehand, just to get a feel for the game, the puzzles, and the portal device.  You will definitely have a much better understanding and appreciation of Portal 2 if you play Portal 1 first.  Also, at only 20 levels, Portal 1 can be completed fairrly quickly.  The humor and voice acting in both games is top notch.  This is by far my favorite game on any platform in quite a while.  It is fun, challenging (without being frustrating), and extremely humorous.  There is no real violence (other than maniacal robots, some outfitted with turrets or rockets).  I haven't played co-op mode yet but it looks like it might be pretty fun.  Great job Valve!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

(again, i realize this was made for the PC, but...) the textures are mostly muddy.  the maps that came on the disc weren't nearly as balanced or as well-designed as the BFBC2 maps (operation metro and grand bazaar come to mind).  there are some really great maps, though, like caspian border, kharg island, and operation firestorm; but to me they just don't compare to oasis, laguna presa/alta, arica harbor and atacama desert.  the gameplay, too, doesn't fare as well.  if i had a dollar for every time i unloaded an entire mag into someone only to have them kill me 100% health, i'd be pretty well off. i get that there will always be lag, but it's bordering on the criminal. it's no fun to shoot someone with a shotgun, twice, from point blank range and have them just run away from you.  every now and then, i get it.  but not a dozen times a game.  at the end of most matches i just feel defeated.unfortunately, for me, BF3 was a disappointment.

Sure the graphics are not that much better and the environment isn't vastly different, but there was really no need to revamp what was already perfected in the first Bioshock. I love how they made the hacking less frustrating and playing as a Big Daddy this time around is a neat idea (gotta love that drill). Don't be fooled that it's just more of the same. The story is nearly as captivating as the first, complete with top notch voice acting, characters and atmosphere. There also seems to be a lot more action, as is the case with most sequels, whether it's in film or video games. Besides, who doesn't love protecting those cute Little Sisters?

I first kinda got interested in Pokemon after my young kids fell in love with the TV series.  After watching umpteen episodes with them, I got interested in the different types of Pokemon and how they compared to each other.  I decided to give the Silver version a shot, having never played any of the previous Red, Blue, or Yellow versions.I was hooked immediately!  The plot is easy to follow without getting boring, and there are plenty of little side quests to make things interesting.  You can start out with your choice of Totodile (my pick), Cyndaquil, or Chikorita.  The level of difficulty of the game will be determined by your starting choice.  The game has two basic goals: (1) Acquire all gym badges and defeat the Pokemon League while fighting off your rival and Team Rocket, and (2) collect all 251 Pokemon.  Most of the pokemon are fairly easy to find and catch, some are pretty hard, and there are a few that are almost impossible to catch.  But, they can all be caught with a little time and patience.  Some are only available by trading with other versions of the game, and some are &quot;baby&quot; pokemon that can only be obtained by breeding two adult pokemon together.  And, of course, there are the two &quot;super-rare&quot; Pokemon Mew and Celebi, which can realistically only be obtained through a Game Shark or other similar device.That leads me to my one and only gripe about the game.  If it were possible to obtain all 251 Pokemon, no matter how difficult, without having to resort to things like the Game Shark, I would have happily given this review 5 stars.  I also have kind of a problem with the fact that you have to have access to more than one version of the game to get all the Pokemon.  I know Nintendo talks about how much fun trading is and all, but to me, it just seems like a gimmick to sell more copies of the game.  I know several kids who have purchased both Silver and Gold versions becuase of this.  Not everyone has easy access to trading partners.Since I bought Silver, I have also played through a copy of Pokemon Red.  If you have only played Red, Blue, or Yellow, let me assure you that Silver (and Gold) is a major improvement.  The new versions eliminate many of the more irritating deficiencies of the old version with an improved backpack for item storage and a new device that lets you tell instantly where you are without having to carry a Town Map in the backpack.  Backpack space will definitely be at a premium, so anything that clears up space is a positive feature.After having played through Silver and collected all 251 Pokemon (yes, I actually purchased a Game Shark), I have not played it again.  Why?  Because after all the time and trouble I went through to collect all the Pokemon, I just can't bring myself to erase them all.  (A great improvement for the next Pokemon would be to allow multiple saves on the cartridge.)  For those who are interested, my &quot;dream team&quot; that I used to beat the game were:  Feraligatr, Pidgeot, Magneton, Kadabra, Magmar, and Dragonite.Overall, this is an AWESOME game.

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options. This includes 16-player online versus action, as well as a 4-player online co-op support and two-player split-screen functionality in local co-op play. In addition, the intense and action packed campaign mode allows for 4-player online co-op play to clear mission objectives with friends, unlockable weapons and the ability to resurrect fallen comrades.Weaponry and GadgetsNo action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and to that endLost Planet 2comes loaded with a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

It has high production values equivalent to Resident Evil 5.  It's a shame that the game sold so poorly that they had to heavily discount it in order to move it...which is great for us consumers.  It plays very similar to the first, but the emphasis on co-op play is what makes this game stand out--you can play online with 3 others in defeating the ridiculous monsters in this game.  The game is a typical 3rd person shooter but the pace at which you move is different from what people are used to, which is probably why it didn't do too well.  This isn't a twitch shooter in the Call of Duty fashion.  When you first play it, you will immediately look for the run button because you move so sluggishly.  There isn't an aim button either which I think was a huge decision blunder.  You can zoom in and out by using the up and down on the D-pad, but that only changes the point of view and it is just not intuitive.  I recall reading the Rage interview in the latest Playstation magazine and one of the designers answered when asked about the games controls that if such and such millions of gamers bought Modern Warfare 2 and they're accustomed to the \"X\" button as jump, then you better make your \"X\" button jump (or something to that effect).  Well, if you play this game, you had better adjust to the control scheme which there are several options to choose from, but all aren't good.  If you go into the game with these caveats, you will more or less wind up enjoying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2010"}

Now a fierce conflict is beginning to unfold in the streets of America. Red Army troops are pouring across the borders of Mexico and Canada shortly after a nuclear missile is unleashed on Washington D.C. Chaos sets in when breaking news informs Americans that their President has been killed and the Russians have invaded the country.Players take on the role of a blue-collar worker who evolves into a charismatic and fearless freedom fighter obsessed with finding and freeing his brother, who has been taken hostage along with other New Yorkers by the Soviets. You must recruit and lead an army of urban guerillas to take on the Soviet threat in the streets of New York City.Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Islandprovides two layers of gameplay: A strategic turn-based mode that centers on base operations in an underground sewer system and an action mode that unfolds in the streets where fierce battles are won or lost and resources are captured.","reviewerName":"Jaba the Hutt","summary":"The invasion has begun!","reviewText":"Freedom Fighters is a surprise hit of the fall.  Freedom Fighters is one of the best games I own, and one of the most interesting.  The concept of the game sounds pretty stupid, but it is actually probably the best concept a game could have.  The whole idea of the game is the Soviet Union won the Cold War and now in the year 2001 the Soviets take over New York.  You play as a character named Christopher Stone.  He is a normal New Yorker making a living as a plumber.  One day on the job all hell breaks loose when the Commies suddenly appear in NY and start taking over.  As the game progresses, Chris goes from a standard blue-collar worker to leader of the resistance known as Freedom Fighters. FF combines a lot of good ideas in one game.  The game is a mixture of action, stealth, turn-based strategy, and a little bit of problem solving.  In order to continue in the game, you have to complete missions and errands for the resistance, like blowing up Soviet buildings, freeing prisoners, transporting supplies, and rescuing other freedom fighters.  Fear not though, because you will have help.  Almost any freedom fighter can be recruited to follow you; all you have to do is walk up to them and hit X.  In order to recruit more people, your Charisma points have to be up.  What that means is you have to do good deeds to get more fighters; you can have up to 12.  You can order your recruits to do almost anything, like defend an area, follow you, or attack a certain enemy.  The Multiplayer for FF is pretty good but it isn't the best.  Throughout the game you will be able to use a fairly good variety of weapons like a pistol, a shotgun, an Assault rifle, a sniper rifle, and the resistance loving Molotov cocktail.  The graphics for FF are very good, especially the environment.  The controls for FF are  easy to learn and don't give you any problem.  Freedom Fighters does have a small number of flaws though. One, the camera angle can get you screwed when you are in close quarters, Two, why does it take 10 assault rifle shots to kill the enemy, and why does it tend to take 2 shots in the head to kill them? Three, the game can get fairly hard and occasionally will get you frustrated.  In the end, though, Freedom Fighters is a great game, and no true PS2 gamer should miss out on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2003"}
{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A fun, non-traditional RPG","reviewText":"First of all, think of this more as an interactive South Park adventure and then it might start to make more sense.  Don't try to see this as a standard RPG at all.  That will immediately make your experience more pleasant.  Second, I would recommend this game for fans of South Park.  If you have seen and enjoyed even a few episodes, then you will like the story aspect of the game.  If you are new to South Park, I recommend watching a few episodes first.  Just to familiarize yourself with the wit.  It's definitely a particularly... interesting?  style of humor.  Of course there is a lot of sarcasm, spoofing, and absurdism.I won't get too much into the game, but let's just say it turns a lot of typical RPG tropes on their head.One negative aspect, which I hope they can fix in a patch, is the frame rate hiccups.  It's not often, and it's minor, but it is there!  It isn't quite as bad as some reviewers have stated - it won't make you seasick! - but it is there.  But that's really the only negative feature.  I guess that and the fact that the game is incredibly short by RPG standards.  I finished it up in less than 20 hours, with all the (few) sidequests and extras.So if you want an RPG that is out of the box, then this might be for you.  It's fun, wildly entertaining, and absolutely irreverent.  Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Malek \"Peter Cage\"","summary":"If Your Easily Offended, Then Grow Up!","reviewText":"Ok I have to say that this game is very good. I honestly cannot believe how immature EVERYONE is being over how \"offended\" they are by this. Grow up, Duke Nukem isn't doing anything that we haven't seen on TV a million times. Hollywood pushes slutty content ALL the time. So much to the point that recently my girlfriend and I started watching old cartoons from when we were kids, and ALL of them have something provocative in them here or there (some even include sexual innuendos surprising even me on a kids cartoon). People need to realize that Duke Nukem is basically just a character who is based on all the action heroes of the 80's, and if you actually WATCH the movies of the 80's with those action stars, you'll see that they didn't have a different view point on women either. Thats the whole reason WHY Duke is the way he is. It's to poke fun at the fact that in those 80's action movies you have a bunch of half naked women running around everywhere, who are just dying to throw themselves at the hero. Is that reality? Obviously not, its just in games and movies. But even still, take a look at reality for a second and think of rock stars in bands. Does the word groupie mean anything to you? Duke Nukem = Savior of his World, Rock Star = Wrote a song wearing leather pants... doesn't sound AS odd to me personally that they portray Duke having lots of women throwing themself at him when you look at it in that light lolHaving said all that, if you are still reading this, then I shall continue on with a more thorough review.Graphics: If you look at this game from the perspective that its been in development for over 10 years, then when you look at the graphics I think it's shocking just how good the game looks. Like it really can impress you. I did find one thing that was a little annoying, but not that big a deal. Which was when you are in some bathrooms (not all) and are looking in a mirror, sometime the reflection of Duke looks really good, and others it looks crappier then anything in the game. However that is the only graphical issue I've discovered in the game, and it was only while looking into 2 mirrors.Gameplay: I LOVE the way this game plays. Whats really awesome about it is how many different optional things they put into Duke Nukem Forever. Its like WOW! You can skip a bunch of stuff, or you can take your time and slowely take in the game with all of its extras. Apparently the reviewers took this as a bad thing since it didn't have anything to do with progressing the story... ok well I guess I'm one of the rare gamers who doesn't mind spending a little more time (if I choose to) messing around in the Duke universe to see whats up for fun. After all it is a video game, not a job that you need to finish ASAP lol. As for how the game plays, I REALLY loved the controls. The game responds very well, and is one of the few shooters that I could see myself replaying several times. I have hardcore ADD, so I find that when playing a game that is VERY much 8 hours of the exact same thing, I tend to turn the game off after 30 minutes to 2 hours (leaving me pissed that I wasted $60). With Duke Nukem thats never the case, they are CONSTANTLY throwing variety your way. I haven't got a freaking clue what the reviewers were saying about half the stuff being impossible to do. They must be VERY bad gamers if thats their opinion, because I have gone through everything without a single problem. I also liked how in this game you dont get that feel of being utterly alone like in some shooters. Your constantly running into people, which provides humor a lot of the time.Sound: First of all Jon St. John is going to impress anyone with his voice acting, simply because its shocking that his voice sounds exactly the same as he did back when Duke Nukem 3D came out. The music is very good, with different variations of the Duke Nukem theme song that sound awesome, as well as other music that fits very well with the game. I think that the most memorable thing thus far about the game is easily how funny some of the background characters are. Since in a game like Duke Nukem, your obviously not going to have a bunch of characters who stay with you from start to finish, so its really great that they include so many people you run into on a regular basis who (whether they live or die) have something hilarious to say right before you part ways.Plot: The story is what is so funny to me. Here is how you KNOW all the reviewers who have a problem with Duke Nukem Forever never played the original games, because basically everything that has happened in this game has happened in previous titles in some form or another. If you dont believe me, go look at what bothers people about Duke Nukem Forever, then look up the stories previously in the old games. Its just simply put that the current generation has been raised to be a bunch of girly men. This type of story didn't bother guys 15+ years ago, but God forbid this new generation sees Duke being Duke. If you never played the originals, then read up on them first, so you understand WHY the plot goes in the direction it does. It makes perfect sense if you know whats happened in previous games.Bottom line, I love this game and if you are the type of person who doesn't take things so freaking seriously, and are thinking about getting this game, I think it's a great purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2011"}

Herring \"Daemon\"","summary":"A few reasons why you shouldn't get this game...","reviewText":"I wanted to like this game. I really did. I read the reviews beforehand and I looked at the screenshots. I ordered the game.I even read that this is from the same people who made the King's Field series--I love King's Field.I hate this game.Is it because the game is too difficult? No. That's a bunch of newb complaints I've read. It has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game. I've put in over 28 hours of gameplay into this game. I've killed some archdemons and bosses in every world. I've got some of the gear. I've participated in the coop and I've had my world invaded by shadows several times.No, I can say that I've put the time and effort into this game to really see that I don't like it. I thought \"Hey, maybe this will become more fun.\" No, I was wrong.Let me number some areas I think the developers got it wrong:1. First and foremost they made this game completely unforgiving. What do I mean? Well, about halfway into the game I accidentally cast God's Wrath in the middle of the Nexus (the main area). I had just purchased the spell. Well it hit a vendor. A very important one that happens to store all of my gear. Guess what? There's no way to undo that. Now he just attacks me any time I get near him. Sure, I could kill him, but I would not be able to store my gear or retrieve my stored gear. You get to either A. Start your game completely over, or B. try to beat the game with the weight on your back. Either way this was an EXTREME annoyance to me. I already had about 18-20 hours invested when this happened and I basically got to watch all that effort go up in smoke. Would this game be more fun if this wasn't a problem? Sure.2. There is not a lot of loot. The reward structure in this game is flawed. You'll go hours without finding anything you want to use, unless you can somehow decipher the wiki information out there and hunt down the treasure--if you can get to it. There are about 15 swords in the entire game. Oh, yeah, you can upgrade your weaponry if you feel like farming the stones. That's about all the variation you will get out of this game.3. The coop system sucks. Plain and simple. It either won't load sometimes or you'll be baffled as to how it actually works. I don't want to study a manual or search google to play with my friends.4. You'll farm endlessly to level your character. You'll probably mess your build up. You'll get to start over again to get the right build if you care anything about this game. I don't care, so I'm definitely not starting over. My build was pretty good anyway.5. Finally, you'll die. You'll die quite a bit. You'll die after spending a half an hour trying to get to a boss only to start over again. This, again, is part of the reward structure that is completely flawed.6. You can only equip things up to half your total weight capacity. On top of that, you have to have the endurance necessary to have \"equip capacity\" outside of that. So not only can you not equip anything you want up to your total weight, but you have to invest in separate branches to do it. It's similar to the magic side of things, too. You have to level your intelligence for your mana or mp, and you have to level your magic for the magic power. Then there is also faith magic, which is a completely different set. On top of that you only get so many slots based on the level of your intelligence or faith (depending on which one you're using). It's completely retarded.Oh, well. It feels like a waste of 30 dollars and a lot of time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Great!","reviewText":"When the current generation of systems first came out, I started out with 360...I replaced it twice, and then after the 3rd issue that was it for me and I went to PlayStation 3.  The unit I got was used, having been bought the year of release by a friend of mine, and then about the time I was looking to get a PlayStation 3, he was looking to get rid of his, so he sold me it and a decent stack of games for about $300.  Not bad.  I loved it...and I had the system for about another 4 years until it finally died on me.  That's a pretty quality system in my opinion, especially after I get my hands on one, because I put it to the test...whatever my primary system for gaming, I use it A LOT!  The same was true with my old Ps3, and it lasted me another 4 years on top of how long my friend had it, so that says something about Sony...they put out quality stuff.  After that Ps3 died, I had no question in my mind as to what I wanted to replace it with...another Ps3!  Besides, I still had games to play for it, and I wanted to play them!  It was funny, too, because my Ps3 died on February 14th of 2012, Valentine's Day.  LoL!  No matter though...I snagged myself one of the newer slims that same day, and I have to say that I quite like it.  It runs very well, it's small and fits better on my wife and I's TV stand by our LED TV.  Plus, turning this one on and off is easier...you just push a button instead of holding a button down for a moment to turn off like you had to do on the first editions.  I have also heard that the new slims are suppose to be a bit more energy efficient, but that's just what I've heard.  Plus, now, I also have 2 controllers...well 3, if you count this knock off plug in one I have, but it's nice to now have 2 wireless controllers, and my buddies that play with me on certain games will like that as well.  All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase of my Ps3 slim.  If you're in the market for a good gaming system and can't decide between 360 or Ps3, my vote is Ps3.  They are better quality systems in my opinion and they have a better array of good Sony-specific games than Microsoft has...such as Killzone, Infamous, Resistance, God of War, Uncharted, and so on.  If you want the fun games, go with Wii (they are fun...my wife and I have one of those too), but if you're a bit more of the action adventure & shooter gamer, I suggest going for Ps3.  If you're one of those types that really enjoys like the war shooters and whatnot online, 360 is still a great system for that...I know people who have 360s who like to play that stuff online and they like it better on a 360.  However, online with Ps3 is still good too, and if you really enjoy playing solo on a lot of shooter & action adventure/platform games, I feel PlayStation 3 is the way to go.  I've said my peace though...do as you will!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"So bad, it nearly made me rethink being a gamer","reviewText":"I have played a lot of games lately, as my birthday and Christmas both occur in December. There has been some great games (Darksiders 2, Far Cry 3, The Walking Dead), some good games (Jak & Daxter Collection, Borderlands 2), some bad games (Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault, Epic Mickey 2) and then there's been Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. The ugliest, most rancid game I've played in all of 2012. Possibly this entire 7-year video game generation. Possibly, the worst game ever made. I'm not kidding.Let's get the \"good\" stuff in the game out of the way: The graphics are good and the voice acting is decent. That is all.Now for the bad:The control set up is literally the worst ever implemented in a major game. Why must you press the L2 button and the thumbstick to dodge? Why must you press \"down\" on the control stick and then a button to drop off a ledge instead of either down OR a button? Why are so many different actions assigned to the exact same buttons? The game ripped everything else off from God of War, why not its excellent control scheme?Cut scenes. I'm actually a fan of cut scenes in games, but I'm an even bigger fan of pacing. This game constantly interrupts battles with 30 second cut scenes to look at a tree or to zoom in on a swamp. It's ridiculous. And it makes the game impossible to enjoy. I don't mind QTEs, usually, but why can't a button prompt just pop on the screen? Why must it literally tell the gamer, every time, to \"Press R2 to do such and such an action\"? Just show us the R2 button -- we can figure the rest out. And don't get me started on the horrible \"circle within a circle and then press any old random button when the circles align\" QTE in all boss fights and many other battles.Settings: A huge, huge part of the game takes place in what looks like the forest of Pandora from Avatar. It's as far from \"Castlevania\" as you can get. It's ugly level design. And it's not Castlevania (which makes sense, as this wasn't made as a Castlevania game; the title was just applied to sell copies of a game that would have otherwise went unnoticed).Level Design: Wow, what idiots designed these levels? I don't even know where to start, so I won't. This is, honestly, the worst level design I've seen since The Force Unleashed (the Star Wars' take on God of War), and it's quite a bit worse than that.Camera Angle: Again, the game ripped everything else off from God of War, why not its excellent camera? Lords of Shadow (I refuse to call this a \"Castlevania\" game, because it isn't) has a camera that's usually too far above the character, but sometimes comes in too close. You will lose sight of the baddies you're fighting in nearly every battle. It's not because I \"suck\" as a gamer, it's because the team behind this game suck as developers.Repetitive Gameplay: Someone could look at an Uncharted or a God of War and think the gameplay is repetitive, but this takes it to a whole 'nother level. While those two superior games -- both of which this one stole from -- change things up and keep things entertaining. They have significantly different ways to fight many varied bad guys and bosses. Castlevania? Jump up in the air to avoid \"ground pound\" shockwaves, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, press left trigger and thumbstick (again, why???) at the same time to dodge, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, press left trigger again to block (although many times you will accidentally dodge, as the same button is used for both), stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, hit R2 when the white circle meets the white circle (good luck if the background matches the color of the circles you need to look at), stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, do the circle thing again, press a random button, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene and the fight is finally over. This is it. That is all. It is the gameplay from beginning to end and it is unbearably awful.I don't usually actively hate any game. I actually (and actively) hated Lords of Shadow. I felt insulted as a gamer just by playing it. I feel Konami insulted all Castlevania fans by putting the name \"Castlevania\" on this game that wasn't even designed to be a Castlevania title. I feel critics insulted themselves by \"overlooking\" the game's flaws for some extra swag or an exclusive interview. I hate everything about this game. I hate this game so much, it has made me temporarily hate gaming. Please, if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and avoid this title at all costs.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

This game is not a fiver star game.  This game is a three star game, but I love it like a five star game.  This game combines many different styles of game play and unfortunately does all of them in a mediocre  manner.  Aside from the music and the story, Nier is simply a mediocre game.  The fighting game play has little strategy to it, the side-scrolling platforming parts are entertaining but usually simplistic and short,  the overhead shoot sequences are interesting, but get old after you do them a few times, the puzzles are usually fun and fresh, and I could go on and about the good ideas that only turned out semi-good.  It almost feels like the creators of the game started something amazing but slacked off half-way through.The main reason this drops to a three star game is that over all the game feels lacking.  Everything seems to almost be awesome in the game.  The combat is one of my main concerns.  The magic is awesome, but the melee gets really really boring after awhile.So why do I still love this game despite it's mediocrity?  The most amazing part of the game is the music.  The sound track for the game is around $50+.  I attribute this to the fact that the music is amazing.  I've spent more time listening to the music than I have playing the game.  Truly one of the best game soundtracks I have ever seen.  Secondly the story is very interesting and engaging.  The game has four different endings and the overall story is quite good.So in conclusion this game will be a hit or miss for you depending on what you are looking for in a game.  If you want something different and can still appreciate a game that fails in whats commonly considered some of the most important areas of game, this game will most likely suit you well.  Hope this helps with your decision.  I'm going to go listen to the soundtrack on Youtube.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win.

And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

Lots of cute new characters for those who liked the women of the RA series.  Supports high resolution gaming :).  Fun to run it at 1920 by 1200 with all effects set to maximum.  Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:--------------------------*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of \"hero\" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more \"tough\" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.  I don't even use her anymore to speak of because of this.To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.  However, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game on STEAM instead of in boxed retail form, since STEAM will not include any of the activation limits or SecuROM malware/trojans/spyware type of crap that will infest your computer if you install the retail version.  I might have given the game 4 stars or so if not for the negatives I listed.  Due to SecuROM in particular, I'm gonna have to give this a measly one star.  If you're considering getting the game on STEAM though, no worries about the DRM concerns I listed as far as I know, so this review in large part wouldn't apply.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

I would call it a semi next-gen console because of this. The graphics can be more compared with the GameCube. The only improvement is that the games are in widescreen and a slight improvement in picture quality. Some would say, though, that some of the GameCube games had better graphics. I can see that ini some games made for the Wii. I can say that the Wii has not been a good investment. This console does not have very many good games. I would say that for the limited games put out by first and third party companies, only about 20% are passable. The only game even worth a look is the Zelda Twilight Princess but then that is also available on the GameCube and I already had that. The controllers are what made this console new in a sense. But the use was force implemented in games such as Zelda Skyward Sword. Problems with the controllers were really apparent in games like New Super Mario Brothers Wii where the jumping mechanics were not well implement. I can understand why people complained about the dash. Nintendo realized the problem and put out a new controller to correct some of the problems with the Wiimote Plus. But by then the damage was done. Further, who wants to spend another forty bucks for another controller? I got the console in order to play Zelda Skyward Sword as it was not available for the GameCube as I am a fan of the Zelda series. But after having played that game I can say that it was not worth getting the Wii for. The other games were mot very good. It reminds me of the experience I had with the GameCube where there were lots of bad games. The best games for this console is actually the Wii sport and that can get quite boring without others to share the experience with. If you are getting the Wii for the fitness game, research shows that it is not an effective way to get fit. So that's out the window. Now, this console just sits collecting dust. The only plus is that it does play GameCube games but then I already have a GameCube. If you buy this, you will need to buy the GameCube controllers. I spend most of my time on the Playstation 3. I spend a small portion on the Xbox 360 as it is only for campaigns. I don't play online on Xbox 360 as I refuse to play sixty bucks just to play my games online. I used to subscribe to Xbox Gold but then after comparing online games (I even had Call of Duty World at War for both consoles and saw no difference in graphics or gameplay) I realized that Xbox Gold was a waste of money. As far as online gaming on the Wii goes, it is very archaic. You cannot actually hear what the other players are saying. Of course you can chat with your friend but the system is terrible. To add insult to injury, Nintendo came out with a microphone that they discontinued because it was that bad. That is a far cry from the Sony Playstation 3 headphones which I use for online gaming. If you want to know what it is like to play online with great sound and microphone, the Sony Playstation 3 headphones are simply the best. And don't get me on the code system just to paly with your friends online. That is just simply a pain in the ass to say the least. Further, having played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 online on the Wii, I can say that it lacks the fun of playing it on the Playstation 3.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2013"}

(Apparently not) I also think that the buying system in this game could have been implemented better i thought it was downright clunky...In finishing this review i will say that this is not a bad game however it is not a game that can be played like other first person shooters you must be willing to invest time into it before getting into any major action if like me your not into that then i would advise that you skip this game and pick up Call of Duty or Medal of Honor or a similar game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001COTC3E","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A Well Done & Successful Version of 'RESISTANCE' For The PSP","reviewText":"Admittedly, I'm not a big PSP gamer, as I only tend to play it when I either have a little free time that's not conducive to my playing on my PS3, or there's a title that comes out that I actively want to play and make time for. Needless to say, neither of these circumstances happens very much. In the latter case, it tends only to be the `GOD OF WAR' titles for the PSP, and in the former case, I tend to spend my money wisely by purchasing titles that have been reviewed well across the board and if possible, are from a series that I tend to play (again, `GOD OF WAR' or `TOMB RAIDER'). It's in this nice little niche that `RESISTANCE : Retribution' falls. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first of how an FPS game would translate to a handheld device that, 1) didn't have all of the controls the six-axis controller did and 2) was also small enough and not ergonomically designed, to the extent that it can cause hand cramping. Regardless of my skepticism though, I picked it up, and I'm largely glad I did. Here's why....THE GOOD : Beyond the impressive graphics, cool looking enemies, and appropriately challenging levels, the first and most impressive thing that struck me about the game, was how the designers tackled the problem of aiming and looking around with the lack of a second joystick. For both of these functions, the PSP's four main buttons (circle, square, triangle and X) act as the second joystick. While you might tend to think this would be a serious pain in the @$$ (as did I at first), this skepticism diminishes almost immediately upon actually playing the game. This functionality is split into 2 separate but very similar mechanics. When it comes to walking around and looking in directions, the triangle & X buttons are up and down, respectively and the square & circle buttons are left and right, respectively. Since your hand is basically placed above these buttons as it is, it makes it all that much easier to control your character. Where it really becomes impressive (and easy) is the aiming. The PSP does the majority of the aiming for you. As long as you're pointed in the general direction of your attackers, the reticule will automatically draw itself to the hostile and highlight itself red so you know you're `on target'. If you're not, you'll need to use the four main buttons to get yourself pointed in the proper direction, but it's not problematic in the least bit. But don't let this make you think this game is easy or that it'll be a cakewalk. It's not and there are some points that are downright difficult as all get out. However none of this is due to movement or aiming which makes it acceptable when you get stuck in a certain spot for a longer bit of time than you have at other points in the game. In fact, there are other concessions to the PSP platform this game makes to help the player out, without making the game too easy. The other that comes right to mind is the `snap-to' cover system. If you're unfamiliar with this dynamic, it basically means that instead of approaching cover and crouching or making sure you're properly positioned behind it, simply getting close enough to it and in the right direction, will cause your character to automatically position itself in the appropriate defensive posture so as not to get hit by incoming fire, but to allow for retaliatory fire. And speaking of firing, weapon selection is also handled quite well on the PSP for this game. Simply holding the right arrow on the D-pad pauses the action (sometimes a very handy trick if you need to get your bearings or formulate a strategy!) and brings up the weapons selection display. Then by using the four main symbol buttons and the right bumper button, you can select from any weapon in your inventory. All in all, the very best things about `RESISTANCE : Retribution' on the PSP are the innovative and clever concessions to the platform the developers made. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this game also comes with the ability to hook it up to your PS3 and, provided you have `RESISTANCE 2', play the game in `infected' mode, where your character gains regenerative health and a powerful magnum sidearm that shoots explosive rounds. Other capabilities exist for this game such as online play and the ability to connect this to your PS3 and play it with a six-axis controller (if you have the right set of cables) but, admittedly, I didn't mess with this option as I prefer to play a game on the platform it's designed for. Of course, there were also some things I would have preferred. Thus....THE BAD : For a game that's so mechanically sound, that looks so good and that is appropriately challenging........why can it be (at times)so ......uninspired? That's not to say that the game is a lame duck,  it's not worth your time, or that it's outright boring, but other than the mechanics, there's very little new here. Most of the enemy chimera are the same as you've seen in the 2 console games, the story plays out basically the same and the protagonist you play may as well be the one from the console shooters as well. Except, well, he talks a lot more and actually has some smarmy dialogue. Even the ability to gather intel is extrapolated from the console games and feels more stale than fresh. But then again, in games like this, that's become par for course, so I suppose it really shouldn't be a sore spot? But what was new, such as the ability to unlock skill points, felt a little forced, like it existed to take your mind away from the fact you were essentially playing a `bite-sized' version of the console games. Maybe it's just that I didn't play this game in a fairly short timeframe and that it was broken up over a couple of months due to time constraints, but even so, I never felt `compelled' to play this game because I just couldn't put it down. It was more like I just enjoyed it when I could. Then again, maybe I'm looking for a little too much when it comes to PSP games that fall into category 2 from my opening paragraph? Like `GOD OF WAR : Chains Of Olympus', `RESISTANCE : Retribution' is simply a `smaller' version of the console games - no more, no less. It basically transports as much of the full experience of the console games down onto the smaller PSP platform. I guess I shouldn't be looking for much more? Having said that, if that's the approach to be had, there really isn't much about this game.THE BOTTOM LINE: As I just stated, `RESISTANCE : Retribution' not only successfully imports the RESISTANCE experience down onto the PSP, but makes some very innovative and clever mechanic and playability adjustments in doing so. With some of the additional features it has, such as the `infected mode', it's a very worthwhile and challenging game to play on the PSP. Not just for fans of the series, but also for fans of shooter games in general who are looking for a successful interpretation of the genre to a portable device. Overall this is an exceptionally well done game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2010"}

(360 is uncapable of doing those.)and the friggin thing runs quiet unlike the jet engine sounds of th xbox 360..no red lights of eath to worry about either.If there are any gripes regarding the PS3, it would have to be the lack of exclusive games and killer apps compared to MS' 360's Halo 3,Bioshock and Gears of War. But Uncharted, Ratchet & Clank, and of course Metal Gear Solid 4 are signs of good things to come. I still love 360's ability to play custom soundtracks and the vibration feature which Sony sorely lacks. wuth the amount of storage data from the Blu-ray disc, the potentual is limitless as developers are starting to utilize the most of this format.All in all you can't go wrong with this purchase which is more cost effective than Xbox's 360 Elite.

We started off on the wrong foot, though. Immediately, I noticed that the free game code advertised on the package hadn't been included. I installed the Moga software on my Nexus 4, and rolled my eyes when I saw that Moga wants to run its own always-on daemon. Lame.But eye rolling became nose holding, when I found that installing Pac Man meant I'd have to compromise my device's security by allowing unsigned apps to be installed. Yes, I know it's something you can turn back on after installing the app. Yes, I know EA does the same thing for DLC on Android. It doesn't matter. It's a lazy way to do things, and Moga seems to expect you to keep that door open whenever you get content from them. For what this costs, you should expect better.The included Pac Man port was pretty decent, but after I was done, I noticed that my device's battery life was tanking. Apparently, the Moga daemon continually searches for the controller when it isn't powered on. I don't know if this is intentional, or a bug. I do know it's annoying.The controller itself feels nice, though it's not nearly small enough for me to say \"This is perfect for someone carrying around a DS / 3DS\" because it's basically the same size and weight.As far as what you can do with the Moga with third-party applications and software, that's a different story altogether. But because it's completely unsupported, that's beyond the scope of what this review should probably be about.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

Fans of the series will also be more than happy to know that God of War: Chains of Olympus stands as the best action title to hit Sony's portable system yet, as it nearly flawlessly brings everything that has made the God of War series so good, and packs it into one small disc.  Taking place before the events of the original God of War, Chains of Olympus finds Kratos as general serving the gods, and also finds him struggling with obeying his orders, or doing what he feels he should.  Undoubtedly the best looking game to hit the PSP yet, God of War: Chains of Olympus retains the excellent production values, addictive combat, tight controls, solid puzzle elements, and unlockable extras that will keep you glued to the game.  The only real downside to Chains of Olympus is that as a whole, the game is too short.  This one flaw is acceptable though, as Chains of Olympus boasts a brilliant score, more fantastic voice acting, and some dynamic action sequences that are easily the best to be seen on the PSP yet.  All in all, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a more than welcome debut of Kratos on the PSP, and is by far the best action game to hit the PSP yet.

The sprite scaling and rotation really helps make the mode7 effects work seemlessly to bring you a 2 1/2D game that is much more enjoyable than those found on more powerful systems like PSX or even N64.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0000631WI","description":"InStuntman, you'll perform dangerous stunts in three or four vehicles as you play the part of a Hollywood stuntman for hire. You'll need to be good: the stunts will get harder, and you must accumulate skills to progress from low-budget productions to multimillion-dollar Hollywood blockbusters. Each stunt consists of a series of clearly defined objectives, which can range from 180-degree spins to perfectly timed jumps, dramatic barrel rolls, and T-bone smashes. To succeed, the player must achieve all or some of each scene's set objectives. Stunts take place on movie sets in six different countries around the world; completing each stunt rewards you with bonus items for use in the Stunt Arena, which you create yourself.Stuntmanwas developed with the help of one of the movies' most experienced stuntmen, Vic Armstrong.","reviewerName":"Douglas Welzel","summary":"Good idea, bad execution","reviewText":"Stuntman gets points for being an original idea, but unfortunately the game itself doesn't live up to the possibilities.In the game, you play the role of a stuntman who works on several different films and also performs in stadium stunt shows.  The stunts themselves involve piloting a variety of vehicles (including cars and snowmobiles) through stunt courses.  A director's voice guides you through the stunt course, telling you what jumps to make, items to crash through, etc.  After you have completed all of the stunts for a movie, you are treated to a trailor of the movie that included footage from your stunts.Sounds pretty good, but the annoyances begin shortly after you pop in the disc.  First, you must complete a stunt almost exactly as the director says, usually within a limited amount of time.  Unfortunately, prior to beginning a stunt you are given no walkthrough of the stunt, so you are left to figure out the details through trial and error.  Continously repeating a stunt gets old very quickly.Next, you must complete a stunt before moving on to the next one.  There is no way to jump between films or bypass a difficult stunt for a while.  This alone removes much of the fun from the game.  If you find yourself stuck on a stunt, there is nothing you can do about it and the game just isn't fun anymore.If you're still interested I would recommend at least renting this one first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

I'm a big Zelda fan and loved all the GBC, N64, GBA and GameCube games, but because of my age, I had never played the \"classic\" Zelda games. So I picked this up, aiming to be a full-blown Zelda aficionado.Yet within a few minutes of play, I realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of Link's Awakening DX and Ocarina of Time. There are no NPCs to talk to, no exploration to be done, none of anything that I had come to expect from the series. I am well aware that I was probably expecting too much, but whether that's true or not, I was disappointed.Although I didn't find anything to enjoy in this game, I'm not saying that it's bad. I'm sure that it was a classic of its era, and those who grew up with NES games will probably fall in love with it all over again.

The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Anthony Peak","summary":"Ups and Downs - But it comes out on top.","reviewText":"Well, this game certainly has it's shares of ups and downs. When I first started playing, I was simply in love with it. The first day I played for 7 hours in one sitting, the next day 10 hours, and another 5-6 the day after. I had a wonderful time but the more I played, the more I realized things were somewhat falling apart. I wanted to give this a 3, but anything less than a 4 just seems unfair. I almost love to hate it.Where FF7 succeeds with a huge multi-layered story, FFX keeps a quite simple plot. And where FF7 has enough well written dialog to fill a novel, FFX throws it all out the window in place of a few lines of voice acting. However, FFX does a great job with the battle system, and almost every single character is extremely useful. The level system is unique, but good. The battles are fun, quick, and a huge improvement over FF8 and FF9. FFX truly brings some great things to the table while keeping the best of the old school Final Fantasy.Sadly though, the story can't really hold up to the gameplay. It has it's bright spots, but overall it's rather flawed. Tidus and Yuna may just be the most pathetic lead characters in FF history, except maybe FF9. In battle, they're both incredible and so is nearly every other character. The rest of the time however is a very different story. Tidus is an overgrown toddler who hates his daddy for no good reason. His voice acting is atrocious with non stop whining. Yuna seems almost like a poorly done Aeris with the energy of Hyatt from Excel Saga. Both in voice acting and story Yuna is simply so withdrawn it's not even funny. She sounds and acts like she's on life support or some kind of pain killer.The rest of the characters don't fare much better, but at least they have fairly good to great voices. Kimari seems like a bad SNL skit. Then we have Wakka, at times a complete retard and redneck. Rikku is the picture of nubile cuteness and my personal favorite, but she's often given airheaded lines. Lulu fares the best of the girls with a mysterious story and lovely dark attitude. Leaving Auron with the best story and a level of cool that's unmatched.All together, you get a game with a mild story at best but a top notch battle system and quite enjoyable gameplay. So long as you can stomach the most bland of voice acting from the most unlikable of couple you'll have a good time playing. The game is fun, fast paced, and graphically stunning under the junk. It's by far the best Final Fantasy since FF7, making it the second best to date in my book and bumping FF8 to a distant third.- Rirath_com","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Lisa Houghtaling","summary":"007  Golden Eye kick's BUT","reviewText":"The level's are great and there is a lot to do to save the world in the nick of time before some bad happen's.

The players slow down when you run sideways, it almost feels like ten yard fight for nintendo. The price is great, but I still think I'm going to buy Madden because it can't be worse than ESPN.  For starters, the moves are awkward and slow, the spin move, dive and jukes don't do much to get you past an opponent, so you're better off trying to run them over.  Next, the passing is simply awful.  It's very slooooow and the receivers drop a lot of balls right in the chest.  The run defense is ok, but playing pass defense is all luck and guess work.  If you have a defender there he'll usually knock it down w/o you doing anything.  The computer controls too many aspects of your team.  Kickoffs and punts stink too, you have no chance to run a kick back on any setting higer than rookie.  You get no blocking and the defense is on you after 5 yards.

Fighters, racers and first-person shooters. Err, rather I should say FPS that deal with the topic of war since others like Bioshock, Half-Life or Halo are perfectly fine for me but redoing World War II events over and over again have begun to bore me over the years. It's quite an accomplishment we even won that war since the amount of Nazis I've killed over the years (and respawning ones at that) gets quite repetitive and same-y. In comes \"Modern Warfare\" which not only brings acting as a soldier away from past year and into a more contemporary setting but it also brings some things that completely enrich the experience and make it way more memorable than other FPS (which is ironic since the next installment is again going back to WWII...ugh). While there's problems that completely aggravated me at times, it's still an intense and fun shooter.Story: Instead of Nazis, we're dealing with Middle Eastern and Russian terrorists and the threat of nuclear weapons. You play as a United States Marine and a British SAS as you uncover the plot of who's behind it all and trying to stop any plans they might have. While typically avoiding the storylines in FPS' and just concerned myself with shooting some bad guys, this plot was quite riveting and indeed many moments in the game such as a sinking ship, helicopter crashing towards you or one shocking moment in one storyline, the plot may not be the most indepth but it's still quite awesome.Graphics: The graphics in most FPS' tended to look fairly flat with grass looking more like flat 2D stuff akin to Paper Mario, Modern Warfare is immensely detailed and there's many scenes where there is just so much going on that it completely sucks you in and explosions, air strikes and the like are very impressive. Even small things like the trail a bullet leaves after a sniper hit or the smoke left by a grenade is well done.Sound/Music: But anyone who knows war movies knows it's all about the sound and the mix brings the intensity needed tenfold and in the most thrilling and action-packed parts, the sound here will give your stereo hookup a great workout. The voice acting is also good and even though there's no familiar VA's, the marine chatter and battle comments don't become grating like hearing a soldier cheering that \"he got one\" for the 100th time.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty much similar to most FPS from reloading, gun exchanging to grenades and lobbing thrown ones back to using turrets but its more refined and I never felt annoyed because my character did something that my hand didn't do. Other than that it's very straightforward from there on in and there's no real sudden curveballs. One thing that did bug me was finding the enemies is still the old \"whatever direction the red arrow points to\" only after you're shot so you have to turn to find out where it is but since enemies are so intent on killing you, you'd probably end up dead before you got a shot off though there is some luck.That was the major problem I had with this game: the difficulty and frustration that frequently set in during missions. I can't count how many times I had to repeat a section because of how fast I died and well enemy AI is great and no longer just charge at you firing randomly, they're still a bit TOO good and enemies from 200 yards away can get a better shot off than I can. While I wouldn't say the game isn't fun for what it is, there's times where I felt like punching something because of how hard it was to do a simple objective.With a short single player but a robust and popular online multiplayer available, Call of Duty IV is a great ride on any system (despite my own gripes about the difficulty).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}
