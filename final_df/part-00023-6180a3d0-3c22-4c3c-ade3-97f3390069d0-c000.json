{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Excellent puzzle designAesthetically and stylistically brilliantAppropriately understated soundCons:Most players will finish it in fewer than 10 hoursBattles are too easy","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"An incredible first for many people, beware action fans.","reviewText":"It's an innocent game.  It's one of the better games i've seen.Pros:  Incredibly simplistic story and setting.  Easy controls  Breathtaking scenery.  Challenging.  Impressive physics engine(unless everything and every possibility was scripted).Cons:  The replay value of an 80's drama.  An annoying effect with camera controls.  An annoying effect with lighting.  Too short.  Very linear (like a movie).Common game elements:  Save points, checkpoints (idol doors), custom controls, timed game (not countdowns), static camera positions, limited dynamic camera angles, equipment(3 swords), no items, no life meter, no HUD, zoom feature, game length: 3 hours to 12 hours: firsttimmers- 5-10 hours.This game is very simple.  It harkens back to some of the most basic elements of any game: run, jump, move blocks, lead princess, fight monsters, find switch, pull switch.The Jist.You, Ico, boy with horns, lead a princess, Yorda, glowing angel, around.  You have to escape the castle.  You must protect Yorda.The trick is that you need her to open these \"idol\" doors.  Easy enough.  But she's not as phsycally able as you are, so you need to find an easy way to get her to these doors that seem out of her reach.  Another twist is that at certain points these monsters try and take her away from you, which you must defend her from.  Another twist is that they will take advantage of your absense and attempt to take her if you leave her too long.  You have no control over her at all... only one command which lets her know you want her to move towards you (kinda like following) and to litterally grab her hand and pull her along.  She won't wander off a cliff but sometimes she likes getting really close.The PuzzlesThe puzzles are challenging, and each differs slightly from the first.  But they are a lot the same: find a way to get yorda to the door.  There are no hints or tips to find out which way to go (but in the beginning Yorda will hint on the answer with her position if you take too long).  Some of the puzzles are trial and error, and some can be trial and death.  But the game can be played with the absence of death for the first time.  The puzzles never change after solving them, duh, and there are no second solutions.  The puzzles are so simplistic in their creation that there's nothing left to tinker with for a second solution.The CombatThe combat sequences are easy, relative to a Tekken player or Legend of Zelda player.  Nothing twitchy at all.  The only way to lose the battle is to be knocked off a cliff(which is rare) or to let Yorda get taken.  The final battle is a puzzle in and of itself.  The battles do tend to get redundant and even annoying at times.  There are three ways to get out of the battle: deafeat all the monsters, run out of the area, or open an idol door, which kills all monsters in the area.  The second option was never intended to be used, but it can be.  There are up to 3 weapons in the game, one of them is secret.  But the basic weapon also serves as a way to solve puzzles.  A few objects can be used as weapons, such as bombs and barrels.The PrincessYorda is unable to do a lot of things.  She can only jump short distances, or longer ones with your assistance.  She can climb short climbs on her own but will require assistance from you higher ledges.  She can't run as fast as you either.  Anything that involves climbing with arms is a cannot-do.  She can do ladders, but not ropes, chains, pipes, ledges, gear parts.  She will not go where she needs to go, except maybe three times.  Her AI is a little stupid sometimes and she won't get the picture until she's in the right position.  I've stood next to her up on a ledge and reached down to grab her and she looked at me for about 30 seconds before walking away from me and then turning around quickly and running to my hand.  Generally she will stay where you put her, but her AI sometimes has to have contact with you.  If you call her she goes into \"get to Ico\" mode and will not come out of it until she gets close to you.  If you leave her for long periods of time she will wander around and play with her elbow.The scenery is breathtaking.  It is beautiful.  It is highly detailed, though on a 1080 scanline TV you can see the limitations of the graphics at the time of the game's production.  It is one of the earlier PS2 games.  The music is rare but beautiful and she is like an angel... really, she glows, you can only see her face in a few places.  It has no replay value, unless you want that 3rd weapon, or are aiming for a quicker time.  But it is beautiful and touching.  It is for almost anyone, children and adults, women and men.  I wouldn't recommend this game to heavy actions players, heavy power gamers, or sports fans.  My brother found it very boring, and my friend found it redundant.  My girlfriend fell in love with it when she saw me playing it, it was her first video game since she was a little kid in Taiwan.  It was the first video game my sister played, and my mother.  It was the first game my dad watched.  I bought it used....  For the price it is more than worth it.Give it a rent to see if you like it.  It isn't for every gamer, but it can be a lot of people's first game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2002"}

Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out?

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Julian Pope","summary":"Nintendo Explores New Territory in 64-bit","reviewText":"After years of coveting my friends Super Nintendo, I finally got my first gaming console. In the Christmas of 1996, the Nintendo 64 arrived.The Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.With a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.It's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Dolphin","summary":"Mario Kart is Fun!","reviewText":"When I had this game, I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game.

Many of the 'professional' reviewers didn't think very highly of it. I'm glad I went with my gut and payed attention to the Amazon review community.I really don't have anything to compare this game to, which is a good thing. It's just different because it has a ton of platforming, which never gets difficult. Now, there is a learning curve when performing some of the jumps, but it kinda reminds me of Princess in Super Mario Bros. because she would float in the air after jumps lol, pretty cool ;)Although I died several times when attempting some jumps, it was never frustrating because I would just adjust my timing on the next attempt, no biggie. But I will say this, if you don't like platforming games, you won't enjoy this, so buyer beware.Yeah sure, the fighting system is pretty basic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Some reviewers will lead you to believe this is a hack and slash game, and nothing more. That's false because you can take care of enemies by melee attacks, shooting them from a distance, or blowing them up, so you have options. As a matter of fact, you won't make it too far in the game if you try and hack and slash every enemy. That works at first, but not for long lol. I really enjoyed using her arsenal of weapons because each one served a unique purpose. Her Vorpal blade was great for close range quick attacks, but could take longer to kill some enemies. The Hobby horse was another close range weapon that dealt out a ton of damage, but be careful if you miss because you'll leave yourself vulnerable to counter attacks. The Tea-Pot Cannon was a long distance type weapon that splatters bad guys with boiling hot tea, you have to charge it up to get the best effect, so make you sure you take cover while doing that. The Pepper Grinder was another long distance attack that operates like a machine gun, but be aware that it overeheats and has to cool down, which takes about a few seconds. The Clockworth bomb is a close range weapon that can be detonated from anywhere on the screen, it can also be used as a temporary distraction to enemies when you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of baddies coming at you.I'm not really into graphics or anything, but the game looks gorgeous overall and each 'world' is varied. Although it's only 6 chapters, this game takes a long time to complete, so you'll get your money's worth with this one.The only issue I had with the game is a small one. The previous 5 chapters were extremely long, so I expected the 6th chapter to be long also. Without spoiling anything, it was not as long. This kind of disappointed me because I didn't want the game to end lol. So as you can see, not enough of an issue to deduct a star ;)If you're on the fence with this game, get it!

{"product_name":"B005THAX5Q","description":"","reviewerName":"masterkey","summary":"The truth!","reviewText":"Some people are solely judging this game and giving it low ratings because of the lies they were told. The truth is, this game does not suck! Is it great? No, but it does not suck. If you can get past the lies that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox told and sold you, this game is actually entertaining. The A.I. leaves a lot to be desired though. Often the A.I. will let aliens run right past them and other times they just can't seem to kill an alien that is right in their face. The enemy soldiers all seem to be marksmen and can sometimes shoot through metal walls and crates and even around corners. You can die very fast in this game as the shield and health drain quickly when you are hit. The aliens don't just stand in front of you waiting to be shot like another post claimed. They will run on ceilings, on walls and right up in your face. The game is also lengthy if you take the time to look around. Those that complete games quickly are the ones that are trying to break the Guiness Book of World Records time for fastest game completion. Never listen to people who tell you a game is too short. That is because they just ran through it. One post said that after patches, the game looks almost exactly like it did in the demos. This is not true. The game is not bad looking but lets get real. The game is not what we were promised graphically and some things were omitted. Randy and Gearbox should be flogged and sued for their lies and deception. With that said, the game is worth a purchase at a lower price. It is not worth sixty dollars simply because it is not the graphical spectacle we were promised and, they lied!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

Your gun runs out of ammo so you cast it aside and pick up one from the opposing solider you just killed, being an vicious Imperial trooper or a hard edge Wehrmacht grunt.Welcome to the gritty battle fields of \"Call of Duty: World at War\". Like the first three games Call of Duty goes back to its chaotic World War Two roots mix in with the gritty and unheroic realism of the \"Brothers in Arms\" series of swearing soldiers and giblets flying across the screen.World at War is both a new chapter in the series and a remake. The New material introduces the Marine campaigns in the South Pacific staring in 1942 at the Makin Atoll and then jumping ahead to 44 the Battle of Peleliu, and Battle of Okinawa.The Soviet missions on the other hard a more or less remake of the first soviet missions in the first game, You fight through the Battle of Stalingrad, again, going on counter-sniping missions, run around in a T-34 blowing up Panthers and Tigers, then charge through Berlin, again, and take the Reichstag, again.The multiplayer fallows the same leveling and perks as Modern Warfare. You earn points by killing other players which will increase your rank and unlock more weapons to use, performing certain feats like killing x number of enemies with x weapon and will unlock things like silencers, larger magazines and better sights, this also includes unlocking perks that can increase your ammo, your health and your firepower.Your skill on the multiplayer seems to be in the hands of chances, because in any of the multiplayer maps with the exception of the HardCore setting the ballistics of your weapons are absurdly weak or absurdly strong. The MP40 and the Type 100 are the most powerful weapons in the game, while your rifles and machines guns are hideously weak. In one match I snuck up to my opponent and blasted him the back of the head with the M1897 shotgun, and it DIDN'T KILL HIM, it took to more blast before I finally got him.Over all World at War is not really that unique of a game. Yes it is fun to play, but there is very little about it that is new. With the exception of the Nacht der Untoten it's come down to `you've played one WWII shooter you've played them all.' What would be unique is precipitation in battles that haven't be done before like Iwo Jima and Kurks, as well as more obscure raids, even more unique is to start off the game as a soldier in Wehrmacht during the opening blitzkrieg of either the Western or the Eastern front then transition to the Allie forces.

{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Ryan Bancroft","summary":"A near metaphysical enjoyment.","reviewText":"Chrono Cross is beyond convential definitions of enjoyment.  Thought on your in-game situation during or after gameplay yields unwanted criticism and unwarrented potential dislike.  However, while playing, pure enthrallment is perfectly framed in the mind.  I don't think that I had a gameplay time less than 4 hours straight during my experience with this game, though my afterthoughts considered my experiences almost outright boring.  I came to accept these primal self-wrought insults to perfection, for, if you can accept the term and are open-minded, this game can proudly wear that constantly sought moniker.  It DOES take an open mind to give this game the term of perfection, because what it does differntly is SO right though still its difference may avert the wary.Centering around Serge and containing a cast of 40 mostly-underdeveloped characters, Chrono Cross is an ambitious title.  From its onset, it throws a twist on the turn-based battle style--requiring unusually high amounts of strategy.  A stamina system (of which each person starts with 7) defines each persons turn, regular attacks requiring 1, 2, or 3 stamina points and spells weighing at 7 stamina points.  Its possible to dip into the negative though this makes turns impossible for a while.  Each person gains back a set amount of stamina every turn, unless they use all of it in which case they gain it all back on the next turn for an indescribable reason.  The storyline is excellent, offering brain-jarring twists (though hurt by the main character's silence).  It continues Chrono Trigger's impressive story, though in a very detached way that barely bares resemblance.  However, nostalgia will hit some of the most familiar, especially the first time such a person hears the remix of win-battle music--its beautiful.  Leading to the soundtrack, its enchanting.  When one first steps into &quot;Another World&quot; the metaphysical trek will magnify ten-fold from music alone.Perhaps this game's only glaring flaw (aside from the character development, or lack thereof) is its reliance on the different.  People are many times aversive to what they aren't used too; I was when first starting, though my open-upbringing allowed me glimpses into Chrono Cross' brilliance.  The lack of classic turn-based battles, lack of convential level-gaining, and lack of MP spell use (this game allows the use of a specific spell once per battle.  The spells are also located in a strange grid in which seeing precludes understanding).Through its oddities, Chrono Cross shines as an innovative foray into the sometimes stagnant RPG genre; a beautiful graphically foray at that.  A must play for those who can accept something different.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2002"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Great fun to be had...somewhere in there","reviewText":"Open-world games are some of my favorites: from the GTA series to Fallout 3. There's so much potential for storytelling and immersion that I keep a close eye on any that are released.[PROTOTYPE] (don't forget the brackets) managed to intrigue me just after I was made aware of the premise. As opposed to most other open-world games, the goal wasn't really to make money, kill a rival gang, or to save the world. When push comes to shove, Alex Mercer exists to destroy and terrorize the city he's been unleashed upon.The STORY, in a nutshell, centers around Mercer waking up on a slab in the morgue, just seconds before he's to be cut open for an autopsy. Once he is out in the world, he's quick to discover that something is different. He can climb up walls, send people and cars flying for entire city blocks, and also he can consume human bodies and disguise himself as them. Not a fun thing to wake up to for Mercer, so he begins to cut a trail of blood and vehicle parts toward the truth of what really happened to him.To me, Mercer's story is of the more confusing and uninteresting sort. At first, I was all for discovering who had done this to him, but then you realize that it really doesn't matter, does it? Since he's working his way out amnesia (lame), you'll have no idea who the bad guys are until the very end, and when the final group of baddies emerge, it's the equivalent of finding out Evil Soldier #1 and #2 are the perpetrators. There's not enough characterization, and not enough backstory given (amnesia) to hold a player's interest in a plot that's way too complicated for its own good. Not to mention that most of the plot is kept in the dark, anyway (amnesia). By the time the big revelation came, I honestly didn't care.So the STORY is a major bust. Its main character is hard to sympathize with, since he turns out to be a mass murdering mutant. But I must give credit to Barry Pepper on his video game voice acting debut. Even though Alex Mercer is sort of a lost cause in my eyes, Pepper voiced him extremely well. And given his recent and equally excellent performance inCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, it's easy to see him having a respectable future in the industry.Now, the GAMEPLAY is what makes and breaks this game...at the same time. The missions are repetitive to the point of unpleasantness, and they all center around the unappealing story that I mentioned earlier, so it's hard to invest much passion into completing them. And in the end, some of the missions become unexpectedly difficult, ensuring that you die at least once or twice on your first playthrough. It all just left a really bad taste in my mouth after killing the umpteenth military commander.But! There's a reason why I rated the game 5 stars on the \"fun scale\" and that's because when you're allowed to free roam Manhattan with all of your powers unlocked, [PROTOTYPE] provides some of the best action ever put to disc. The powers that you attain are unique and devastating to your opponents. Thrust your hands into the ground and watch as a mob of pedestrians are impaled on a field of spikes. Swing your whip around a squad of enemy combatants to see them all fall apart in pieces. This game is so bloody that you will almost feel bad that it's so much fun.One of the more awe-inspiring things that the game allows is jumping to intercept a helicopter, hijack it, use it to gun down anything you wish, and if you happen to be destroyed you can jump from the flaming wreckage onto another helicopter to continue the fight. Woooow.Another really neat aspect of the game is that a virus is slowly sweeping through Manhattan. When you first start out, you're lucky if you catch one person collapsing on the street or coughing up blood, but by the end of the game, buildings will be on fire, entire streets will be crowded with abandoned vehicles and kill-crazy mutants, and you'll find the military desperately trying to quarantine the area using propaganda, blockades, and brute force. The progression from calm to mayhem is well done and exciting.It's a shame that I can only recommend this game on the basis of a bright spot of its gameplay aspect. [PROTOTYPE] is a joy to just mess around with, but the missions will get boring and the story is convoluted, complicated and shallow (which is amazing how it managed that). This is a game, likeAssassin's Creed, that has a marvelous concept that just begs to be expanded upon in the sequel. I would love to see more variation with the \"consume\" aspect; running up the face of skyscrapers and throwing cars at helicopters disguised as an old lady was very entertaining, but there were hardly any well-designed characters to consume.

It is glitched, repedative, and feels older than it actually is. The background characters on the streets feel like they were ripped out of 2002's Vice City. This is an 08 game and it feels six years old.You level up your chacacter in a contrived, story driven narrative that looks choppy and unfinished. The plot is paper thin and the graphics do not look good for it's time. The enemy AI borders on annoying, with tanks that can shoot you down, helecopters that can shoot you through buildings, and agents that can sense you even though you are disguised... It is disjointing to be slaying the undead horde when a tank appears and shoots you even though you are dressed as a soldier.It makes up for that with the gameplay. You get powers as you play... cool powers. You can jump from building top to building top, turn your arms into vicious weapons, take over tanks and helecopters (Nothing else I'm afraid), and EAT PEOPLE with your tentical powers! The game controls so well and the movements are so fluid and perfect. The way the people rip apart when monsters, or you, cut them to ribbons is so detailed and great that I just can't stand it!

{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"Fun RPG, Battles= No fun","reviewText":"I really enjoyed the story, however, I can't get past how boring the battle system is. You \"control\" one character (if you want to call it that) and the other characters fight based on AI.Essentially, it involves you pressing the x button over and over again until the battle is won (unless you want to cast a spell). You can upgrade weapons and armor, as well as skills, and the fairly complex skills element would be really cool if it weren't for the fact that their application in battle is hardly seen because of what's stated above.This game would have been MUCH, MUCH better if more of a turn play based approach was used for the battle system. How boring to sit there and bang on the x button. If I wanted to do that, I would buy some kind of fighting game.I've decided to download the demo version of Phantasy Star - Sega's other seminal RPG.

You can bank with the R Button and tip down your nose while making jumps. You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles. Driving techno music and top-notch sound effects, including the hum of your car's turbines unwinding, relentlessly propel the action. The aggressive artificial intelligence of your rivals never allows you to ease up.","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Not so new anymore, now is it?","reviewText":"F Zero appears to have had one purpose: To demonstrate the Mode 7 graphical capabilities of the Super NES. Great Nintendo, mission accomplished. I can definitely tell that is a game of the SNES based on the OUTDATED  graphics. Now, what else does the game offer to a collector like me? Soundtrack? It is pretty good. Controls? They are a total tragedy. Content? You get to choose from 4 cars and like 6 tracks. Not very much, don't you think? What about the level of classic it is? I believe the Super NES had three launch titles, Pilotwings, Mario World, and then this. Mario World obviously stole the show, Pilotwings was a hit, and F Zero... I believe it got little attention outside of the graphics.

The packaging came in one of those plastic shells that are a pain to open but you know it's well protected. After I got it out of the packaging, I held it in my hand and to my surprise, it felt right. The trigger has this swoop on the end so it practically locks your finger into place unlike the triggers on the Dualshock 3. The O, Triangle, Square, and X buttons feel solid. They click when pressed and still feel sturdy. The Move button, the one in the middle is kinda like the X button. It almost does everything in the gameResident Evil 5: Gold Edition. I'm pretty sure this Move button would be the main focal point for all games because it's in such a convenient place which is dead in the middle of all the buttons and it's huge. The Move button is clear with the Move symbol inside and it's about 4 or 5 times bigger than the standard buttons. The Move only comes with the Move itself, a manual and a strap. The strap is jet black with a clasp that has the PS logo on it and it does lock into place. After I finished staring at it, I plugged it into my PS3 with my extra long USB cable;I turned it on with the PS power button on the Move. As soon as it powered on, it paired with the system. The process took no more then a minute. I had a couple of demos I downloaded off the PSN and immediately started to try out the demos. The controller response was amazing.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"An extension of Uncharted 2, which is no bad thing","reviewText":"It's hard to live up to a masterpiece like Uncharted 2.  UC2 pushed the limits of what was possible graphically on the PS3, and managed to wedge in a great story and characters as well.  UC3 is the logical progression of UC2, and features some of the best level staging ever in a video game with an amazing eye for detail, and battles that are refreshingly tense at times.  The character development in this series continues to intrigue, and the voice acting stands at the top of its class.  Despite all these great aspects of the game, there are a few glaring weaknesses that keep UC3 from being a five star release.The first thing you will notice in UC3 is the stunning visuals and attention to detail within the levels.  Every nook and cranny of the world in UC3 can be investigated, and you will want to go out of your way to do it.  100 treasures are randomly spread throughout the game, and traversing the world will feel like a delightful adventure more than a boring search and fetch quest.  From the ornate wall patterns on the building walls, to the cracks in the mountains, to the stark landscape of a Syrian desert, the art direction in this game is second to none.In past UC games, Nathan Drake has always come across as a bit too aloof for my tastes.  Sure, he has the charm to get the girl and kill the baddies, but Drake was equally dumbed down in his ability to run and gun down anyone in his path with no remorse or retrospection.  In UC3, Drake starts to warm up a bit, and his personality shines more than ever.  He finally seems more vulnerable with his situation, and the other characters are not blind to it either.  The characters of Elena and Sully both spend a good deal of time confronting Drake and his obsessions, making both the plot and characters more believable, and thus propelling the overall arch of the story in a nice direction.  The same can be said of the others characters as well.  They evolve nicely from UC2, and you actually care what happens to these people while they try to traverse this insane adventure they all share together.  The dialogue writing in UC3 is absolutely wonderful, and it represents a rare instance where you want to hurry up and beat whatever level you're on just to see what the next cut scene will be.Another huge improvement with this installment is the action sequences.  While it seemed nearly impossible to top the death-defying craziness that was UC2, UC3 bests its predecessor in every aspect when it comes to adrenaline-filled and tension-soaked adventure scenes.  The chapters which revolve around the sinking boats are fantastic, and some of the most beautifully staged action sequences I've ever seen in a video game.  Smooth frame rates, a ton of variety, challenging objectives, and the unique sound collages combine to make some simply awesome levels of heart-pounding activity.  Additionally, these boat levels completely, and literally, turn the gameplay on its head, when the boat turns sideways before it begins to sink, and Nate is forced to escape whilst jumping on surfaces that could be walls, could be floors, or something that resembles a combination of all of the above.  There are several disorienting moments in UC3 that really liven it up and keep things fresh where the past Uncharted games failed to do so.  A hallucination scene when Drake is lost in the desert is another instance where the storyline is injected with some nice changes that keep the players on their toes.  And again, there is the writing, that skillfully paces the relentless action sequences with scenes of Drake disoriented, trying to find his wits before he is thrust into the inevitable battle that waits around the corner.With this solid foundation of writing, storyline, and gameplay, some annoyances manage to bring the game down somewhat, preventing UC3 from being a transcendant experience.Naughty Dog never seemed too concerned with the AI in the first two Uncharted games, and UC3 is no different.  The AI with the enemies in this game is some of the worst imaginable.  What is otherwise an unbelievably inspiring and gorgeous level is frequently brought down by the lumbering, stupid, and lazy behavior of the enemies.  In the boat level, the guys you must battle will flank you, shoot at you, sit there for a moment, look the other way, shoot at nothing, then calmly wait for you to put a bullet in their brain.  There wasn't a single moment in UC3 where I felt particularly challenged during a battle.  While I appreciate Naughty Dog's unwavering focus to story and character, that dedication is trivialized slightly by completely idiotic AI in the enemies.  The quick time events have got to stop, as well.  This was fresh and new ten years ago, but nowadays the QTE is intensely boring and ultimately unnecessary.  Each and every time you perform hand to hand combat, you will push triangle to evade, push circle over and over to push someone, and push triangle again for a counter attack.  Zzzzzzzz......  What's more, the QTE system detracts from what's happening on screen.  It's like trying to read subtitles while you're in the midst of an intense hand to hand fight.  Please, Naughty Dog, no more quick time events!The cover system in UC3 is nearly broken, as well.  While one can argue which franchise UC3 rips this idea off from (Gears Of War, Modern Warfare, etc,), the covering system often is more tedious and clumsy than it is helpful.  There are many times during the game where a battle begins and several cover options will make themselves available within a tight area.  You'll push the button to take cover, but you'll end up swinging the wrong way or taking cover in a completely different area.  The cover system allows you to push a button and switch to a new area if you have to, but when there are five spots to take cover in the same general area, the game sometimes doesn't understand where you're intending to go.  There were several times where I attempted to take cover but the game had me slide into a spot that was out in the open, thus ruining my cover.  The cover system in general in UC3 is a throwaway attempt at other genres anyway, and just isn't necessary to begin with.  It detracts from the solid writing and gameplay that exists in all other aspects of the game.Interestingly, as solid as the writing with the dialogue and characters is, the script suffers in other areas.  For instance, each time you get through a laborious level and uncover the treasure, the enemy will be waiting for you as you exit.  It's a tired old Indiana Jones trick, and the Uncharted series pulls this ploy again and again.  Of course, when you confront the enemy after recovering the trinkets, the dialogue is something like, \"welcome to the party\", or \"well, well, what have we here?\", or \"thank you for recovering what's mine\".  It's tiresome, boring, and beneath the Uncharted series to constantly relegate itself to scenes like this.  As strong as the writing is in UC3, these scenes really bring down the quality of the story.It's also a disappointment that the player can't watch the cut scenes separately like in the past.  I'm not sure if I'm missing those somewhere, but with past Uncharted games the player could go back and watch all the cut scenes once the game was finished.Despite these complaints, the overall pull of Uncharted 3 lies in its cinematic quality.  Many games do a fine job of giving the player a feeling of directing a movie, but UC3 stands alone in its grand scope of what's possible in a video game.  In the 11 hours it took me to finish this game, I couldn't wait to see where the storyline would evolve next.  Its sense of wonder and adventure in the video game world is unrivaled, and one-ups Hollywood with its singular focus on plot and character development.  With some major tweaks and fine-tuning to the battle system and AI, UC3 could easily be the most fluid, colorful, and masterful adventure game of all time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

This Game you have a 30 sec intro and you are driving and racing.

However SA added many features to the gameplay and had a huge environment to explore in. One of the least mentioned features to me, compared to previous GTA titles is the right clicking to aim and shoot. Simple change but makes a significant impact and makes shooting much more precise and the firefights fun. Story wise it is OK, I didnt really get into that whole rap thug stuff. I liked the 80s gangster theme more in Vice City. Graphically it looks pretty good, nothing to complain about. But again, the shooting and firefights were the best thing in SA. There is one incredibly fun part, midway through the storyline where in order to gain control of territories you have to provoke (and defend against) opposing gangs. That was probably one of my all time favorite parts in any single player game. Other great features are car mods and the Casino which for some odd reason they removed from GTA IV. At the end of the day its all about the gameplay and replay value.

By no means am I saying it isn't fun or even that it's not as or even more enjoyable then what's already being offered on the market.In my opinion it's really nothing new. I feel like the novelty of motion controlled gaming has worn off. I know the presentation of the Kinect is different and unique in it's own way, I am however not talking about how they accomplish it, but more so the end result, which is gaming by motion.My review is from a current Wii owner and from someone who prefers the traditional sit and play style, so keep that in mind while reading this and before making your decision whether to purchase it or not.I own all three next gen systems and honestly spend all my time on the Xbox 360 and the PS3, with the Wii only being dusted off for get togethers with a party themed atmosphere. The argument about the Kinect being for a more mature audience doesn't really hold true either, at least not right at the moment. What I mean by this is the game library for the Kinect is very family oriented, just as it is for the Wii. This may change in the future but as of right now it is.The Wii and the Kinect both offer great gaming experiences and truthfully there's nothing funnier than watching someone try to play them, however in my opinion one system is enough. If you don't own a Wii and you're interested in finding out what all the hype is about surrounding motion controlled gaming then pick it up, however if you already own a Wii/PS3 Move and like many other people it has just become a paperweight, then you may want to wait for either that must have game or a price drop.Kinect is a lot of fun but is it worth full price, for the reasons I stated above, the answer would have to be no. If you're new to motion controlled gaming then I guess it boils down to which one (Kinect, Move or Wii) offers the most bang for your buck. Do your homework before you purchase any one of the three, they're all big investments.If you're like me and most of your gaming time is when you're alone, then you may want to forego all three and just play them at a friend's house. I haven't played the Move but I can tell you from experience that the Wii and Kinect lose some of their appeal when played alone, at least for someone who is allowed to see R rated movies.Thanks for reading,Michael","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"My First Impression Of FF13","reviewText":"So far I'm only 4 hours into FF13 and its been great! After the major disappointment (IMO) that was FF12, FF13 is a godsend. Imagine a dash of FF7 and a hint of FF10 and you get the basic mechanics of FF13. You don't get to control all your characters, you tell them what type of actions you want them to do and the AI chooses the best actions for them, be it medic,attacker, or defender. You only get to control one character that the game assigns you, usually Lighting or Snow. Unfortunately the game also gives you your party members automatically with no way to change them around. The level system has also gone back to FF10 style where you use a more refined sphere grid to gain HP,strength,MP etc...The graphics of FF13 are some of the best I've seen on my PS3 to date,the character models are fantastically done,possibly THE best so far. The cut scenes are also fantastic and are only marginally better than the in game graphics. The menu system also has some pretty cool animations. Definitely unique. The story is also very intriguing and I could barely pull myself away from the game to write this review or even to eat!FF13 is linear, but I like it linear. I hated the open free roaming world of FF12 that doesn't tell you were to go or lets you go to an area your not ready for and lets you get mopped around by the monsters. Apparently the game opens up at chapter 10 (out of 13). A lot of people complained about the linearity of FF13,but then way more people complained about FF12's open ended world...cant make everyone happy.Overall this game is the best FF since FF10. And I recommend you buy it as soon as you can. I also recommend you get the strategy guide as a couple of places in the game are fairly hard without a hint. If you pre ordered it at EB games you got a free mini guide and poster. But the mini guide only covers the first 3 chapters/4 hours of the game.UPDATE: April 5th: I'm sorry to say that about a week ago I shelved FF13. I got to Gran Pulse (where the game opens up) and FF13 just fell flat on its face. It became boring,repetitive, stingy with Items and Crystalium Points and just wanted you to save \"crystal C'ieth's(side missions)\"-this is not optional. You must save these crystal C'ieth's to open up a part of Gran Pulse you need to progress in the game. This becomes repetitive because your constantly going back and fourth on the map fighting the same monsters which are very cheap on CP and items,this means its a PITA to make your characters stronger because you only move 1/4 of the way on 1 ability on the CP chart if your lucky on one battle (the harder battles)! Also getting crap items means you cant upgrade your weapons/accessories and you can't sell the cheap items for any money to buy better upgrading items. Overall very disappointed in what started out as a very well liked game. I can't believe how Square made such a good game turn to poo 25 hours into it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMR6Q","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Still Golden After All These Years","reviewText":"The first Golden Sun wowed gamers on the GBA by being one of the most amazing RPGs to ever grace a handheld.  Golden Sun: The Lost Age continued this amazing series in 2003.  But after that the series went on a seven year break.  Now that the third one is finally here one has to wonder if it's worth it.  The good news is that it is.  Even if it hasn't really evolved much.  But this also means that much of what made the original two great will surely make this one great as well.Golden Sun: Dark Dawn takes place 30 years after the events of the second game and you'll play as the offspring of the heroes of the previous two games.  The second game in the series ended with the release of Alchemy back into the world of Weyward and it's changing things in several ways across the world.  The story actually has promise, but it takes a while to really get going.  If there's one thing about Golden Sun that might've been best to change, it would be how the story paces.  It takes several hours for the story to really get going.The story is also drowned out in tons and tons and tons of dialog.  One of the things the Golden Sun games have always been bad about is being much more dialog heavy than your average RPG.  Characters will take lots and lots of time to explain the simplest and most basic of things.  Understand, however, that the problem isn't \"too much talking,\" the problem is that much of the dialog is superfluous.  There will be moments where you get the feeling your characters are talking about nothing or talking in circles.  This probably comes to light most in some of the conversations where there are encyclopedia entries for you to click on and learn more about Weyward.  For example, early on it'll mention Vale.  You click it and learn that it was a village that was destroyed alchemy was released (something already told to you in the opening crawl anyway).  In spite of clicking on it to learn about it, the characters will actually explain it to you anyway.  Even in moments where they ask if you understand something... even saying that you do will prompt the characters to explain it anyway.Golden Sun Dark Dawn stays familiar in more ways than one.  If you were acquainted with the first two Golden Sun titles, then Dark Dawn is like squeezing your hands into a familiar pair of gloves.  Much about Dark Dawn operates in the same manner.  The Djinn system is back and it's more or less the same as it's always been.  As you travel the world you'll meet several Djinn who will give your characters powers.  There are four types: Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Mercury.  Each with their own elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water, respectively.  When you set a Djinni to the character they'll grow more powerful and be able to cast some powerful spells.  This is also how they'll change job classes.  There's nothing quite like it in any other RPG.  It's still unique to Golden Sun.Likewise, the game's battle system hasn't really changed a whole lot either.  It's the same old turn based affair where you select all your characters actions and then watch them proceed in battle.  Golden Sun's battles are fairly fast paced, although much of it is on the easy side.  There's not a lot of deep strategy involved in Dark Dawn.  There are plenty of ways to dispatch your enemies.  Either by normal attacks or by Psynergy (Golden Sun's form of magic).  The animations in battle are great--especially the summons.  It's definitely easy on the eyes.  While the battles may not be hard, the dungeons can sometimes keep you busy with their puzzles.  Most puzzles are pretty straightforward and simple, but others will have you scratching your head and really challenging you.  One of the other unique things about Golden Sun is that there are a lot of spells that are actually used outside of battle as well.  You'll cast spells to help you put out flames, or move objects around or make vines grow.  The puzzle element can often be more fun than the battles.It's the story that doesn't balance rather well with it all.  We talked a little about the ridiculous amounts of dialog and exposition, but another thing that's a little annoying are some of the responses you have to give.  The game has a way of presenting you with choosing which mood to respond in, although you don't always know how you're supposed to respond.  In the end the only thing it changes is how characters respond to you.  You'll also be asked lots of yes or no questions.  In most cases your response doesn't matter here either as you'll still get an earful anyway.  In the other instance they'll keep posing the question to you until you choose the response they want.  In a way this is charming.  You have a silent protagonist (it wouldn't be Golden Sun without a silent protagonist) but the \"Yes/No\" questions weren't much to write home about in the first two anyway and here the extra layer of choosing a mood doesn't add a whole lot to the experience.In spite of all this, Golden Sun is still a fantastic game.  The dialog may be superfluous at times but the story and the characters within it are still charming in their own way.  The game also utilizes a lot of 3D which is something a good deal of DS games still don't do.  Make no mistake: Golden Sun Dark Dawn is beautiful and it runs rather smoothly.  The environments are colorful but the best is definitely the detail put into the battles, with characters moving fluently.  The summon animations really showcase what Golden Sun is capable of.  From a production standpoint, Golden Sun Dark Dawn is one of the best looking games you can find on the DS.  A game on the DS has simply never looked this good, and it certainly hasn't sounded this good either.  There aren't really any voices to speak of but the melodies the soundtrack provides will make you glad for that.So was the long wait worth it for fans of the first two Golden Sun games?  Definitely.  Everything about Dark Dawn is purely Golden Sun.  The game hasn't evolved much in its jump from the GBA to the DS, however.  Purist of Golden Sun probably won't mind this.  For others it means that Golden Sun reveals certain aspects about the JRPG that might seem a little dated.  In spite of that, while some of the mechanics may be dated, they happen to mesh together really well and stick to what really works for Golden Sun.  Meaning the only REAL letdown Golden Sun: Dark Dawn might have is that the game doesn't do much to reach above what the first two achieved.  Is this a bad thing?  Not exactly.  For handheld RPGs, the original two gave several console games a run for their money by being so well constructed.  The third game does the same thing.  Even if there isn't much change in that construction.  At the very least, it shows that Golden Sun has aged rather well.  Especially considering it had a seven year break.  There's still nothing quite like it.In spite of some of its flaws (which aren't really big--especially one you settle in and get absorbed) the important thing is simple: Golden Sun Dark Dawn is just a lot of fun to play.  There's no reason for an RPG fan not to play it.  It's big, it's epic and it's a blast to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2010"}

The game first off takes way too fast to beat even on hard. It also have a lot of the same characters and level layouts and really does not give you a variable of opponents to fight against. The lack of multiplayer and after campaign content make it not really worth the campaign itself.The cinematic trailers were decent but not the best. Some of the graphics seemed choppy and did not flow as nicely as other games i've played. I also noticed that when fighting the final boss, it would sometimes glitch up and you'd end up dying from a fall that you didn't even do.Overall the game is a great buy at a lower price point, I would wait to get this one.

Berk","summary":"Great game with great single-player expierence","reviewText":"Halo is a very addicting and fun first person shooter that launched the Xbox system off the ground when all hope for the Microsoft platform seemed to have gone.  The science-fiction based game works because of its intense cut scenes, and shocking plot twists, but what really makes it work is the feeling that your character (Master Chief) seems like one who really does serve a purpose in the military and that he is a part of the marines in their fight against an alien force.  Most of the rest of the plot found in Halo is typical sci-fi shooter, but it's the atmosphere they manage to create with this game is what keeps it from being thrown in a bin of useless Half-Life and Doom knock-offs.Gameplay:  The controls are great and are easy to learn (both on Xbox original and 360) and do not offer you much difficulty so you can get into the action quickly without having to spend much time experimenting with the controls.  Only problem I had with the gameplay is for the most part the weapons are inaccurate and it makes you think: \"Isn't this supposed to be the future?  This assault rifle is about as accurate as an air-soft pistol.\"Graphics:  considering it is one of the first Xbox games ever made I have to say that the graphics really manage to hold up to this day.Story:  The Human vs. Aliens concept has been used to death in the video gaming industry so Bungie makes a wise choice and decides NOT to concentrate entirely on fighting aliens as that would quickly grow boring.  They throw in some rescue missions and support operations which make your character feel that you are actually do something to help.  Of course later on the game we come to an uninspired \"random zombie parasite,\" but they make such a chilling cut scene that you are able to forget that this type of thing happens in just about every FPS sci-fi game EVER MADE.Entertainment:  Halo: Combat Evolved is immensely entertaining and will have you angrily messing with it for days as you try to beat all the difficulty settings.This game is a much better single-player experience than its two sequels that suffer from over-simplicity and lacking ANY sign of intensity.  I don't care how much Bungie spits and polishes this series or how many weapons and power-ups they add it still won't change that they've turned the series into a Rambo style shooter and there are HUNDREDS of games like that already on the market.If they ever make another Halo game they need to go back to the basics and really see why the first game is still the most popular entry in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Xavier 7","summary":"Seven years later....","reviewText":"Call me late to the party but I've barely started to seriously play the Halo series this year.  That's right, this year...ten years after the original's release.Why such a late start you ask.  Well, I was never impressed with the amount of hype the Halo series seemed to garner especially since it seemed Bungie ripped off every FPS convention that was the de facto standard on the PC, slap it on to a console FPS (some of which the Dreamcast could claimed to have been there and done that) and have it acclaimed as revolutionary.  All gripes aside though, I started with ODST, moved to Reach and just beat CE: Anniversary.  Now that I'm towards the end of Halo 2, I think I can insert my thoughts on this game on Amazon's review section.I admit, the Halo series is fun.  It's not the be-all, end-all of FPS games but it is very well done.  Halo 2 is no exception.  For a game that turning seven this year, it looks fantastic.  I'm playing it on my Xbox 360 via a Sony KDS-60A2000 60 inch HDTV.  If I didn't know any better, this game could serious pass itself as a very early 360 title.  It looks fantastic; had I played this in 2004 the graphics would have blown me away in the same fashion Metroid Prime and RE4 did.  It's really a rough sneak preview in types graphical wonders that are commonplace in games circa 2010 and 2011. Not to mention, this game is leaps and bounds better looking than its predecessor, in that game's original, un-remade form.Now, all graphical gushing aside, I must admit the single player mode is very short.  I have managed to reach one of the last levels of the game in just two, albeit, long gaming sittings.  That being said, what is present in this short game is good but not without a one annoying flaw.My biggest, and really only, gripe about this game is the predictability of it.  It seems you are thrown into a scenario with some exploration, then you get bogged down in a room or two slaughtering enemy, after enemy, after enemy, after enemy, boss.  Rinse and repeat until you get to the end.  Sure, there are sprinklings of vehicular combat - which is very welcome considering the limited amount of vehicles you commandeer in Halo: CE - which give Halo 2 a break in the monotony.Unfortunately, being that it's 2011, I totally missed out on online multiplayer.  I remember some of my friends loving their LAN parties with the original Halo and also hearing what an excellent experience Halo 2 was on Xbox Live.  I believe them, especially if it was anything like current online Halo exploits.  I really wish I was better online though, or at least had a mouse or even Wii Remote type of device on the 360 as that'd give me a more competitive edge and precision over analog sticks.The music is great as is the sound.  There was an odd piece during one of the banshee fights that seemed out of place though.  Also, the SMG sounds very weak compared the the Aliens-esque sounding assault rifle in the original Halo.Anyway, enough rambling.  Halo 2 is a very enjoyable game is still a lot of fun in 2011.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

It is a great sequel and has amazing features.1.The worlds that Sora and friends venture through are great. My personal favorites are The Land of Dragons(Mulan), Port Royal, Steamboat Willy, and Pride Lands. There are replay worlds like Olympus Colliseum, Agrabah, The Little Mermaid, Hollow Bastion, and Halloween Town.2. The graphics are amazing! The camera has also been changed and you can rotate it with the right analog stick.3. The battle system is much better. I like how you do special moves by using the reaction command like in Mulan there is Red Rocket and in Tron, there is Cluster Code.4. The drive bar is also a great feature to KH2. Sora fuses with Donald or Goofy or both and turns into a different color and weilds two keyblades to deal more damage.5. The magic is great too. Old spells like fire, blizzard, thunder, and cure are back and new ones like reflect and magnet.6. This is also magic. The summon spells are great. The new summons are Chicken Little(funny), Stitch, Peter Pan & Tinker Bell, and Genie. CL fires baseballs and firecrackers at the heartless, Stitch plays ukelele and fires his green laser gun, Genie mimics Sora's moves, and PP does this cool attack.7. The new charaters are awesome. My favorites heroes/heroines are Jack Sparrow, Simba, Mulan, and Roxas. Some new villains and olds are back like Maleficent, Hades, Shan-Yu, and Pete. Pete is a traveling enemy working with Maleficent to destroy Sora. Pete appears randomly so don't be suprised if he's in almost every world. Oogie Boogie is also back.8. Speaking of Roxas. You play as Roxas through the beginning at Twilight Town. Roxas, played by Jesse McCartney, has dreams about Sora and suddenly gets a keyblade.9. The new pause menu is fascinating. The abilitites have been changed around, and Jimminy's Journal, which was boring last game, is now upgraded and has a section for each world10. The gummi ship is upgraded too. In KH1, it was slow and boring, but now you are at a fast-paced action-packed sequence battling ships, nobodies, and bosses literally being thrown at you.11. The abilities are great. Some new like Explosion, Fantasia, and Slapshot, and some older, like Vortex, Trinity Limit, and Scan are back.12. The limit ability is awesome. Sora and party members do this cool attack. My favorites are Trinity Limit and Comet.13. Last but not least, the keyblades are sweet. There are brand new like Monochrome, Bond of Flames, and Follow the Wind and old like Kingdom key, Oathkeeper, Oblivion, and Ultima Weapon are back.All in all, I think everybody should at least rent this first. Awesome game! I hope there is a KH3, I heard rumors of it with worlds like The Jungle Book, and Hunchbakc of Notre Dame, and now since Disney bought Pixar, we might see Nemo, Dory, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Boo, Mike, Sullley, Woody, Buzz, Flix, and Dot in KH3, 4, and 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"The next step in DS evolution","reviewText":"Think of the Nintendo DSi as an upgraded DS Lite rather than an all new device. It features a few new things, but is far from the next generation of DS systems. So this is defiantly not for those with and content with the DS Lite, since the steep price and relatively few new features dont warrant a re-purchase. The DS Lite (Nintendo DS Lite Crimson / Black) is cheaper , and may end up being the device that best suits your needs/style.The DSi has larger, brighter screens than the DS Lite. I believe they are ~40% larger, and a great deal brighter. While you still cant play comfortably in very bright sun light, all other conditions should be covered. This, unfortunately means that battery life has decreased. The larger, brighter screens (along with a slightly more powerful processor) cause shorter battery life.Exclusive to the DSi is the DSi Shop, where you can purchase smaller, cheaper games off the internet. Games are ranged from $2 to over $8, and once bought games are downloaded directly to the DSi's internal memory. Its easy, but depending on your internet speeds and the size of the game being downloaded, it may take a while. Some games are free to download, and the portability of it can be compared to iPhone/iPod apps.Another entirely new addition to the DSi is the two cameras and the slew of software that comes along with them. One camera is positions on the inner bridge of the device (where the two screens hinge), and the other is on the top; so when the DSi is opened, one camera will be facing you, and the other the direction in which the DSi is pointed. Both camera are low quality (.3mp), but serve as fun diversions when used along side the supported software. A bunch of \"lenses\" allow you to play with your image, such as warping or shifting, adding graphics, or distorting. While this isnt very technical, it does prove entertaining for a limited time (the kiddies should have a blast with it though).The DSi has a longer stylus, and repositioned start/select buttons. The power switch is now on the inside (like a button), so for those that have accidentally turned off the power of their DS Lite, this is a godsend. The direction pad itself is now much smoother, more responsive, and easy to move. Diagonal movement is now very easy. However, the GameBoy Advance port is entirely removed. So there is no way to play any GameBoy games on the DSi, so those with a large GBA library, beware.The DSi does have some great new features and software, and as time goes on, the DSi Shop will include better and more games. The DSi is thinner and lighter than the DS Lite, but it is also a bit longer. All older DS games are full compatible, and the brighter screens make them look great. In the end, however, it really boils down to whether or not you can/want to spend the extra +$40 on what may not be needed. Some great exclusive software like Flipnote Studio and the Internet Browser may not be enough to warrant the extra cash, since both systems can play the bulk of all DS games, Pokemon included. If you can afford it, however, the DSi offers great opportunities over the DS Lite, and definitely shouldn't be missed.Pros-2 cameras-longer, thicker stylus-DSi Shop-more responsive D-pad-Much lighter, and thinner-SD card support and stronger processor mean great potential functionalities-Exclusive software like Dsi Music and FlipNote StudioCons-The shorter battery life may not be for those constantly on the go for long periods of time-cameras low quality-No GBA port-a bit longer","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"M.

I thought it clearly was the best next-gen football game, albeit with flaws.Skip ahead to Madden 10. I have to say, I think great improvements were made to create an overall great, realistic, football experience.Pros1) Graphics/Presentation- the graphics and animations look VERY realistic, and much better than last years. The addition of gang tackles, the new Pro-tak system, the collision detection and the added cut scenes all contribute to the most realistic looking Madden game ever. Even the little things, like the hated \"chain-gang\" and \"fight for the fumble\" I really enjoyed. It's great when you're putting together a great drive and your RB fumbles the ball, only to recover it through a frenzy of button mashing mini games. I really enjoyed it. If you don't like it, turn it off.2) Gameplay- Another area I feel has greatly improved. The best part about the gameplay is the amount of control you have over every aspect. The sliders, if you will. I personally looked on a gaming website and found someone who listed \"the perfect slider settings\". I used this as a basis, tweaked some things, and now I have all the sliders finely tuned and I'm having a blast. Plus, the team and individual stats in Franchise mode are very close to real life. You may have to tweak things here and there, but having control over basically the entire game gives you great flexibility. Overall, I think the gameplay is great.Cons1) Glitches/AI. This game is not without it's flaws. Lead a WR a little too much, you overthrow the ball by 100 feet. Use the right analog stick for a big hit? Sometimes a glitch makes the player you're controlling continue to go for a big hit, even if the play has gone down the feel, often times leaving you way out of position. Very annoying.Also, WR still catch balls and then run directly out of bounds. (Talking about cpu AI here)2) Commentary/Extra Point Show/Half time highlights. Extra point show is useless, adds no depth to gameplay, half time show is more of the same, but at least an attempt was made.  Commentary is really bad. I often play this game with my Ipod on. Collinsworth is annoying and the other guy is just boring and sounds robotic.In closing, if you're a football fan, you probably already have this game. If you're on the fence, like I was, pick it up. You will not be dissapointed. Again, it's by no means perfect, but it is clearly the best next-gen Madden to date. Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2009"}

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Easy and fast way to get 7.1 surround in Xbox 360","reviewText":"I looked at a few headset options for my Xbox 360S and the X41 seemed the most logical due to the simple optical audio hook up. The other headsets required a spaghetti maze of audio cables. The X41 is also wireless, with the exception of the talk back cable for Xbox Live gaming.I was skeptical about the 7.1 surround because I've tried other \"solutions\" in the past with mixed results. The X41 is quite different. I didn't really feel a difference initially when playing CoD MW2 or Medal of Honor. It was difficult to get a good position on some of the sounds because of the single player campaigns. However, when things start to slow down and focus on small arms combat, the X41 shines. I can hear if someone is moving behind me, or if a grenade drops behind me. The X41 also registers bullets that whiz by and give you a good idea of where it is coming from. More importantly, after logging several hours, I can start to pinpoint exact areas where the enemy is located based on the direction of the gunfire sounds.The microphone is very good at reproducing sounds, and with the X41 you can hear your voice through the headset. The chat volume is also independently adjustable from the game audio, and chat boost allows you to set a baseline chat volume, which then is amplified automatically based on game audio levels.The thing I really liked about the X41 is that I am able to get surround-quality sound without waking the neighbors at night, or using up half my office for the subwoofer and speakers. I have a 5.1 speaker setup for my PC and it takes up way too much real estate. The X41 immerses you into the game.Pros: Easy to install, uses two AAA batteries, everything is wireless except for the talk back cableCons: Headband adjustment is quirky, tends to slip around a little, microphone boom is too flexible.Overall: 5/5 stars, well worth the coin*************UPDATE for 16 NOV 2010:After using the X41 for about a month, there are some quirks of note. One is the battery life. The box says greater than 20 hours on alkaline AAA batteries. I call BS on this, because my higher capacity NiMH batteries only last on average 10-15 hours.There is also a constant hissing sound which will drive you batty. I am using the optical link, so it is all digital. I isolated as much interference as possible and the transceiver is only a few feet from my headset.The microphone boom is a little TOO flexible, but I haven't had any major complaints. The earmuffs are COMFORTABLE and have yet to give me any problems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}

And I gotta tell you it feels great doing bad things that anger many parents in games. This game has excellent missions, plenty of gore, hilarious sexual themes and humor, tons of swearing, inappropriate jokes that are still funny, wierd characters, strange weapons, and an awesome multiplayer experience. The multiplayer experience is still one of the main attractions to this game because it's still really, really awesome to shoot, decapitate, fry, stab, and blow up your friends. Also worth mentioning are sequences in the game that represent things similar to Saving Private Ryan, and the part of the game in which to defeat flame creatures you must get Conker drunk and make him pee on the flame creatures. The only problem with the game are the controls which are at times wonky. The world war II themes in this game are far better made than the horrible PSone mess Hogs of War which I awarded a 3.5 out of 10 mark, compared to this game which I awarded a 9.5 out of 10.

{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"If you liked the PSP, you will like the Vita.  But ...","reviewText":"I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a Vita and spend a good deal of time playing two games that I was looking forward to - Uncharted and Wipeout 2048 and two others.I won't waste time regurgitating the stats on the device - you can see for yourself on the Vita page on Amazon and chances are if you are interested in the device then you are a motivated buyer who did some kind of research ahead of time.  So here is my (somewhat) abridged impressions:(For full disclosure, I own a PS3/XBOX/Wii/PSP/3DS/DS/iPad2/iPhone4S etc.)1. Initially I was concerned about the size of the Vita.  Some early reports said it was bulky and felt cheap.  While I can't dispute that the shell is made of mostly hard plastic, it still felt pretty good.  The weight of the device felt balanced, and while the Vita is \"big\" to the eye, it is not heavy to the touch and has a nice sleek look to it.  The design is also more comfortable thanks to the rounded edges and redesigned appearance.2. The resolution of the screen is nice.  Images were vivid.  Pictures were clear.  The front touchscreen works extremely well and all in all I was impressed at Sony's (albeit late) foray in to the world of touch handheld gaming devices.  However, upon playing the games, I can say with 100% certainty that the games definitely look fantastic - but they are NOT PS3 quality.  I'm sure many of you already know that, but I just want to inform those who are expecting to play their PS3 on a handheld system.  For me it was more like PS 2.5 graphics - much better than the PS2, but not quite PS3.3. The browsing speed of the 3G version was okay.  I wasn't extremely blown away.  I experimented with surfing various sites and found the download speed to be inconsistent.  Some pages loaded extremely fast, others were slow.  But keep in mind this is on a 3G connection so it is an issue that can affect other devices as well.  Nonetheless, I did enjoy surfing on the device thanks to the big screen.4. The buttons were easy to use, though the D pad and the buttons feel somewhat small and might be a bit tricky to use for people with fat fingers.  The dual analog sticks feel comfortable and easy to use.  They are a bit small and you can't click on them, but trust me, it's great to have two sticks on the device.  It just makes playing games feel much more natural and gives the Vita a nice console-feel to it.5. The picture quality of the camera is okay, but not better than what I take on my iPhone 4S.  However, I do like the fact there are dual cameras.  My only gripe about the front camera is that it is located very close to the buttons and it is easy to smudge that area of the Vita given its location on the device.6. Video quality is decent.  I really enjoyed watching some music videos on the big Vita screen.  However, while the clarity of the videos is nothing to sneeze at, it doesn't blow what I see iPhone 4S out of the water.  Nonetheless it is more than fine for most people and again, I really like the big screen.  Just note that the Vita does not support HTML 5 video (it does support parts of HTML 5, but just not the video component of it) or flash.  Hopefully that will change down the road.7. The UI is very easy to navigate.  It is easy to launch games, apps and manage your settings on the touch screen.  I was very pleased with this aspect of the Vita as well.Quick Game Impressions:Uncharted - Definitely the sharpest looking game that I tried.  The graphics are solid and they are impressive the second you turn on the game.  It may not blow away what you see on the PS3, but it is definitely the game that you show off to your friends when you carry your shiny new Vita around.  The gameplay is smooth, and I like how it incorporates touch actions (like taps and wipes) to in-game combat and movement.  Definitely a must-get launch game.Wipeout 2048 - If you played Wipeout before, then there isn't a lot here that you won't be familiar with.  It's a high speed racing game with sexy graphics.  But honestly after playing for 15 minutes, I got kind of bored.  It's pretty, but it's nothing I haven't experienced before.  The load times were also a bit long.  I wouldn't consider this a MUST get.Little Deviants (included with the First Edition Bundle) - A surprisingly fun game that makes (great) use of the rear touchpad.  It might feel funny at first, but after you get used to the (excellent) rear touchpad, you'll be addicted to this platformer's string of fun minigames.  I had way more fun playing this than Wipeout (to my surprise).ModNation Racers - Essentially a PS clone of Mario Kart, with lots of colorful graphics and the ability for you to modify your racer/cars etc.  Initially I was impressed with the customization options, but once I actually got to the race, I found the game to be too similar to Mario Kart but without the charm.  The gameplay itself was alright and the car I tried out controlled okay, but overall the graphics also didn't blow me away.If you do buy a Vita, I would recommend Uncharted and Little Deviants as good first round buys.  I can say this, I definitely had more fun with these games than any of the 3DS launch games (no dig at Nintendo as I do think the 3DS has some fine games as well, but Sony seems to have at least done a better job at launch time here in the U.S.)Now to the But ... in my title.  My only main gripe with the Vita (so far) is the expensive cost of the memory cards.  It is annoying that you can't buy anything other than Sony's Vita-only memory and paying $100 for a 32GB card does seem very excessive.  You also have to get used to gripping the Vita in a different way to utilize the rear touch screen, but again, that's more about learning something new than anything else.  The pricetag is also somewhat hefty, but to me it's worthwhile if you are into games, which leads me to ...All in all - if you are a hardcore gamer, you'll love this toy.  It's not a PS3 in your hand, but it comes pretty darn close.  Even though it has tablet-wannabe ambitions at times, in the end the Vita is a solid handheld gaming system for people who CARE about and LOVE games - plain and simple.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

One plays as Nick Kang, a rogue cop that gets things done around L.A.  The graphics is fairly decent, better than Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, but the kicker comes in the fact that there are still many, many collision bugs and on occasion, the graphics chug.  For instance, one time, my car actually got stuck in the ground literally!  Another instance was that Nick Kang went through the wall during a stealth mission.  The controls are okay, but they are not great.  For fighting sequences, generally button-mashing gets the job done (think Enter the Matrix here).  For shooting sequences, however, the great fault lies in the fact that sometimes Nick gets pulled into zoom-in sequences when you don't want it.  Lastly, sometimes, Nick suffers a tremendous delay in reaction, which results in him receiving damage.Now onto the good parts...The story is well-done, and because of their development of the character Nick Kang, one can actually sympathize with him. The branching storyline is excecuted fairly, but I wish that it was much more fluid (aka Deus Ex or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City).  The cinematics is like actually watching an old-school Jackie Chan flick.  The inclusion of a street map is great!  I wish that The Getaway offered such a counterpart.  Lastly, the multiple varieties of cars and crimes offer good diversions.Overall, this game is okay, but Activision needs several improvements in gameplay and controls.

Whether it's movie ideas, being able to rock out a 20,000+ stadium with your own music or create your own game magnum opus, we want to be able to show people something we've done and put a lot of time, effort and even heart into and go up to someone and say \"I made this\". However, a lot of us don't have the resources or tech skills and the ability to be taken seriously when we say \"I want to create a game\" and while it sounds like an immense cliche, Little Big Planet pretty much guarantees that. With the abilities to not only create your own levels and share them online but play others, this could well be the game with the longest replay value in a long time.I'll get the technical details out of the way since I'll be spending some time on the \"create\" part and share portions of the game. The game runs in 720p and it looks quite gorgeous. Yes, it's no Metal Gear Solid 4 or Lair but the charm, attention to detail and ultimately the feeling is just there and it feels perfect. The sound is also quite well-done with some lively tunes playing throughout your levels from upbeat to creepy. Sound effects are quite welcome and let's face it: isn't Sackboy just awesome?  Only thing that people might have a gripe with is that the levels exist on different \"planes\", sort of like different positions on the road. But without being able to rotate the camera and see whether a trap is on one plane or the other, it can make it particularly challenging to figure out how to pass a trap since you keep getting nailed.Now here's the meat of the game: the create-a-level stuff. Basically, you're given a blank canvas to pretty much make any kind of level you want. Obstacle courses, races, themed levels to various environments to just plain old puzzle solving. But be warned: your masterpiece will take time and patience and planning out your level takes a bit more work than just slapping things together but it's immensely satisfying seeing your stuff playing out. There is a couple of gripes such as unintentionally springing your own trap or tools you wish the game had such as weather but considering the amount of different levels you can muster, or if you want to and just create levels based off something like a videogame or old movie and it's easy to see where the appeal of the game comes from.  Another is that the tools and options that you can use to create the levels are unlocked within the main story mode so for example if you wanted to create, say a Las Vegas style city with a bunch of neon, you'll find there's actually no template for a city landscape yet so what I do is just play through the main story and unlock as much as I can.Sharing online is another big facet of the game as you can go online and check out other gamers' levels and play through those and if you really enjoy the level, you can \"heart\" so you can play it whenever you want. With the ability to co-op it or just go solo, this is like an infinitely re-spawning game that just keeps adding to your playing roster and can keep you busy for awhile. It's not exactly the fastest service though; I suspect though it's more for the game's popularity then an actual technical fault. And let's be honest: while the game does allow that freedom to create your own levels, some of the custom made ones I played had incredibly vague puzzle solutions and more than once you'd wonder \"how are you supposed to past this part anyway?\"The controls for LittleBigPlanet are easy to understand and they'll feel immediately intuitive but on the other hand, some parts aren't as ironed out. Basically it's all about X and R1 with the former being your jump and the latter being your grab, useful for moving objects or grabbing spinning shapes or hanging light bulbs and whatnot. The only real problem is the jumping which is at the same time too sensitive while also being a bit too unforgiving. In a game where physics matter, it's too easy to overshoot your guy off a thin platform into a firey death or you miss entirely. I have the same problem with Mario games at times where your character seems to want to move a few steps past your landing spot and it's hard to slam on the brakes. I call it the \"Butterfingers Syndrome\" of gaming and it makes the game not necessarily frustrating in that Super Mario Sunshine way with the floating platforms in a vast empty void but it certainly sticks out.While games like Metal Gear Solid 4 are undeniably impressive in its production values and direction, its meandering storyline and a not-for-everyone feel sticks out about the game. I found it over-the-top and not as excellent as Snake Eater but I have a feeling Guns of the Patriots will be given numerous Game of the Year awards because of the grandioseness of it all. LittleBigPlanet on the other hand is not only accessible, fun and charming but it's for everyone and these aren't just simply well-designed games with a certain fan base, this is something for everyone all over the world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Gc \"iPoker\"","summary":"The best modern/classical Zelda game!","reviewText":"I always regretted not playing enough Zelda games, but after getting the 3DS XL, this was my first purchase. The only other Zelda game that I beaten was Link's Awakening for the Gameboy, which I might add is a great game too. In fact, I would have never bought Link Between World if it wasn't for that game. Anyways, I was excited to play Link Between Worlds, because it looked like a game that kept the classical gameplay. No doubt, it plays a lot like Link's Awakening but with a lot of graphical and animation enhancements. The music and sound is awesome, not only does it match the environment and story, but when you hear it, you know that you're playing a Zelda game. Also, the game kept all the classical gameplay while also spicing things up with a lot to modern game standards like being able to rent weapons, upgrade weapons, gambling, mini-games, etc. The puzzles maybe difficult for someone who never played a Zelda game, but you can still beat the game without cheating. There are enough clues in the game that makes it fair to beat. I wish that Hero Mode was already unlocked because the fighting was way too easy. It took me about 3 weeks of casual play to beat. The gameplay and story easily outmatch any game available today on any system. The puzzles are clever and holds up well compared to Link's Awakening. The gameplay is addicting, in fact, the most addicting game I own so far. My only other two games are Pok&eacute;mon X and Animal Crossing: NL, plus a bunch of old DS games. In my opinion, Link Between Worlds is the best DS title that I currently own. I plan on checking out Link to the Past also. Right now I'm working my way backwards with Phantom Hourglass and Fourswords. After that I will play Ocarina of Time, which I heard was like the ultimate Zelda game lol. No doubt, Nintendo always have something good going on with this franchise that players are proud to support.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2013"}

Lots of fun.What I liked:-Graphics - WOW, the graphics are stunning. Especially when you play this game on a large HDTV.-Sound & Music - Absolutely brillant. Try playing this game using surround sound Headphones, the sound and musicwill blow you away. (Highly recommend Tritton 720 Headphones). Music on Hades level is chilling.-Epic Boss battles - I have not beat the game yet, but I think I am about 70% -75% through the game and the boss battles have been truly epic.************Possible SPOILER**************-Adults Only Content - I just discovered Aprodite...hehe. How many of you have replayed that scene severaltimes???? Come on be honest! LOL...I have.**************End SPOILER*****************-Kratos - Total badass. He can take down anyone and does it in a very brutal & violent manner. Some of the QTEkills are absolutely brutal.What I didn't Like:-The controls - Not always a problem, but did cause a lot of frustration when the double jump didn't work. I justdidn't find the controls as responsive as for istance Uncharted 2.-The lenght of the game - From what I hear, it a fairly short game. 8-10 hours just isn't long enough when you haveno multiplayer. I have had this game for about 3 days and I am almost at the end.-No multiplayer Online - In the age of Online gaming, it an absolute must to have multiplayer online. You spend $60and shelf the game after a couple of weeks, not a good value.-Replay Value - I don't see the replay value of GOW3. Maybe one would replay it again a couple of times ondifferent difficulty levels, but after that it becomes boring.Overall, GOW3 is a great game and a MUST play for any PS3 owner. I am still not big on owning games that offer no online play, so I would say rent it. I am renting it now and will finish it on normal soon, and play once again on Titan and after that, its being mailed back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

TRANSPARENCY WORKS WELL!","reviewText":"So I got this game today after a month of reading reviews. Originally, I was disappointed by the professional reviews. IGN gave this game 3/10. I can't believe it. Even a worker at a local Gamestop told me not to get this game and get something else like the Fallout:New Vegas because he trusts IGN (btw, he never played The Fight: Lights Out). OMG, how WRONG they were. This game is simply AMAZING. I'm starting to lose trust on those professional reviews and even opinions from the workers at places like the Gamestop because I'm pretty sure they got paid for the rating good or bad. Some of the game that has 9/10 happens to be disappointing sometimes.I was actually planning to trade-in my move controllers because the only game I liked with the Move was the Sports Champion. For me, FPS shooters such as MAG with the MOVE is more difficult to control than on the Dualshock 3 controller. Also, I bought both Kung Fu Rider and Time Crisis: Razing Storm and was disappointed and traded-in both games. I'm so glad I picked this up despite the bad rep from the professional reviews. Now, I have a reason to keep my MOVE controllers.For $29.99, it's a STEAL! You could burn a lot of calories and have a great time playing both single player and multiplayer mode! It's a must buy for all the MOVE controller gamers!!! I paid $44 including tax for this game and not regretting!UPDATE: The new patch came out few days ago, and now, your main character is transparent like in the Sports Champion. This was the main reason I decided to pick this game up. It works really well!!! I think those professional reviewers should review this game again because most of them complains about how they can't see opponents punch coming due to lack of transparency of your main character.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2010"}

I spent much more on the gameback in late winter, and I'll still get my $'s worth.  Don't even worry about getting a new copyor paying for an online pass, because the multiplayer has two forms of effective combat, kickingand leashing (electric whip).  There is an echoes mode, in which you replay campaign levels (i'm not convincedthat it's a different form of gameplay); echoes is like a condensed campaign.  While playing Bulletstorm,I occassionally felt the title of the game pertains to the action, but in the final level, in which you get to mantwo consecutive gattling guns, the title of Bulletstorm rings true.  There's alot of color in the game, and a good varietyof gameplay.  The outdoor environments look great, but the indoor levels make you wish the entire gamewas played out in the open, where you can see all of the alien planet.  The nature of the gameplay lends better to spacioussettings than cramped spaces.  Some games produce a feeling of suspense in tight, dark places, but Bulletstormjust oozes a claustraphobic feeling.  You can choose to play the game either from a distance or up close and personal.There's a decent array of weapons at your disposal, which are unlocked as the game progresses.  My favorite toolsof destruction are the sniper rifle and bombastic lasso gun.  The gameplay's usually brainless, but occassionally,you have to use your noggin to solve puzzles to open pathways.  I didn't have a use for all of the points I collected,because you're supplied with ammo, and once you unlock charge shots, your equipment isn't upgradable.  I can seehow this would be a \"point freak's\" game, because there are alot of ways to score big.  If you're like me, and just wantto stay alive while causing as much destruction as possible enroute to the closing credits, Bulletstorm will entertain you,but not thrill.  I did feel a sense of accomplishment after intense fire fights in some of the later levels.This is an innovative, solid FPS.

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Skyrim is the absolute pinnacle of what an RPG is all about","reviewText":"So let's get this out of the way:  I've never played any of \"The Elder Scrolls\" games, so I came into Skyrim without any preconceived expectations.  I have played Fallout 3 and Fallout:  New Vegas, so I had some idea of what Bethesda might do.What they did end up producing is nothing short of not only the best RPG of all time, but perhaps one of the best GAMES of all time.I'm early on in my playthrough, so I'll be updating this review as I progress through the game.  But here are my impressions:- When they say you can go anywhere, they MEAN IT.  I won't spoil the beginning of the game, but once you have full control of your character in Skyrim's open world, you can go ANYWHERE your eyes can see, one end of the map to the other, to include at the top of a mountain.  \"Gliding\" down a mountain to get into the first town, that was an epic experience.  There are no \"invisible\" walls or \"on rails\" here.  Your adventure is whatever you want it to be.  Sure, you might get crushed by an uber-powerful enemy (much like in FFXIII when you hit the open world there), but that's the game steering you back and telling you that you'd better level up and get stronger.- As for the world, it is one of the greatest graphical achievements on the PS3.  The amount of detail going on, from the snow, to the air blowing through the cave passages, to the radically different dungeons...it's all beautiful.- \"Newbie\" friendly gameplay.  As someone who hasn't played an Elder Scrolls game (but had some Fallout experience), this system is easy to use, equip/deequip items, pick up/use items during gameplay...it all works seamlessly.  Combat can be approached in a myriad of ways, from magic, to swords, maces, bows or just sneaking around people and slitting their throats. And you can't just run in (at least in the beginning) and just hack away; the first two times I died, it was my own carelessness.  You have to plan your attacks and make judicious use of your restoration spells/healing potions.- The music is also extremely well done (to include changing \"tone\" when a significant enemy is nearby, something I appreciated LOL), as are the sound effects.  The voice acting is OK, but we're talking tons of NPC's, and no company has that much money to make EVERYTHING unique.After frying Dragur's with my fire spell, running my sword through bandits, squashing spiders, and going up and over mountains and valleys, I have to say all my other games are going into mothballs until I see the well over 100+ hours Skyrim has to offer.  It's simply one of the best games ever.  If you're any kind of an RPG or Elder Scrolls fan, this is an absolutely must purchase.  But even if you're an action game player, this game isn't so overwhelming that you can't succeed.  And that's a testament to a game that is challenging but never frustrating, a balance so many others have tried but failed to match.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

I play primarily COD/MW, and the sound is fantastic.  You can play around with different Surround Sound \"angles\" on the XP400 to get just the kind of sound you prefer.  There is an equalizer, which has 4 presets (Flat, Bass Boost, Treble Boost, or Bass and treble Boost); you cannot adjust equalizer settings other than this.  I had no issues with sound quality whatsoever.  I have a few other wireless devices, including a phone and router about 5' from where I use the XP400 and had no interference.  The headset can select 2.4 or 5GHZ bands though, so if you do run into interference, hopefully one or the other works for you.  Wireless range is about 30 feet, which should work for most folks.COMFORT:This product is fuller than your typical lightweight Microsoft Xbox headset.  It is not overly heavy, but it is noticeably heavier.  It is, however, very padded and adjusts to a wide range of sizes.  I have found it to be very comfortable.FEATURES:The ability to switch to Bluetooth to take an incoming mobile phone call is very neat.  Pairing is simple.  As far as controls, they are all well-placed an intuitive.  There are controls on the transmitter for surround sound and pairing, while the headset itself is used to control (left ear cup): power, volume, tone, and mic, and (right ear cup):  Bluetooth, bluetooth volume, and mic mute.Chat Boost is another nice feature.  The feature adjusts the chat volume so that spikes in game sound do not make the chat harder to hear.The battery is lithium polymer.  My initial battery charge took a while (a few hours).  The battery is advertised as \"more than 10 hours\" in the manual and \"up to 15 hours\" in ads.  I've found I get close to 20 hours of gaming on a charge, and recharge can take place while gaming!  The battery does not appear to be consumer-replaceable, which is a drawback.Overall, the XP400 headset has beautiful sound and works very well.  It is easily the best gaming headset I've used.  It is pricey though, so you have to weight cost versus value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

What I got after playing for a few hours is pretty much the uncut pc game that came out in 04. Its definitely better then the xbox experience. I'll list the pros and cons to make it more easier. Note when I compare, I'm comparing to the original xbox game(i never played the PC version)PROS:-Sharper visuals(the game looks just as good as it did even better now with nice touch ups done)-The full Doom 3 pc experience minus the mods.-Its fun going through corridors and shooting demons and zombies like your remembered it. The surprise encounters still hold up though this depends on how much you remember.-Varied weapons,they're all fun to use.-Multiplayer,its fun and a nice diversion.-The classic doom's,they are a joy to play and have achievements.-New Levels,nice bonus for veteransCONS:-Way too many ammo, I hardly if ever have ran out of ammo it makes the encounters less suspenseful knowing I have enough shells and rockets to take out the 2 imps and 3 soldiers etc. I even played on veterans first.-The auto save is annoying it will save at random spots for ex. After you kill the marine zombie in the beginning it will save even though there's a zombie 2ft away from you,no big deal in lower difficulties but its really annoying on veterans and nightmare.-No button mapping, I don't know what else to say-Its too bright, from the get go you'll see the base interior are all brightly lit although you can lower the brightness the darker places are alright kinda.-The ambushes can get annoying and predictable.-The multiplayer is tacked on.-No co-op(i know its not major but still it would of helped the game in general)-Doom 1&2 is unplayable from hdd(the disc will spin)-No subtitles,nothing to say but wow.Last word:Overall I am enjoying the bfg edition, its a nice way to take a break from the modern fps wave. Its still a well made game and its finally great to play the doom 3 game that the PC has just done on console now. Doom 1&2 are fun throwback games and your getting enough for your money overall. Its in no way a perfect HD re-release and I'm sure this version is for mostly newcomers but experienced doom players should still give it a go if they really want it now if not wait for when its $20 and lower.

It is obvious that this game introduced the job system, and while I haven't gotten far enough yet to utilize it, I can say that it is a pretty neat idea, since I did play and beat FFV, which had the same system. While I liked some of the later entries before XI better, this particular one is definitely a must play in my book! It has a descriptive story plot for the time it was originally released on Famicom in 1990, and that along with all the other elements carried on to the DS pretty well with improved visuals and sound effects. One really cool thing about this game is that instead of automatically obtaining spells as you level up, you can buy them, which makes it easier to manage the spells you want, and the ones you don't want. I also like the personality of the characters in the game, they are varied and interesting. I also enjoy the ease of battling your enemies and the simple leveling system as opposed to the difficult, awkward ones in the later entries, and some other RPG games released in the late 2000's.

{"product_name":"B002I0HJ68","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Dead Space 2 Improves on an Already Classic Original","reviewText":"The original Dead Space was a classic with a few minor issues.  If you disagree with that assessment then you probably want to read another review because that is my starting point when evaluating Dead Space 2.  The issues with the original were minor but noticeable, mainly the environments got repetitive and the PC version has some annoyances.  Dead Space 2 does away with both these complaints and on top of that adds some new gameplay elements which really push it into 5-star territory.First off is gameplay, which while firmly rooted in survival horror (meaning you will have to manage ammo, health and inventory) does not make the mistake the recent Resident Evil's have made where the game plays like a shooter but controls like an adventure game.  Dead Space 2 might not be as fast-paced as something like Call of Duty but it controls well and your ability to shoot enemies and run away is not artificially impeded by a bad control setup.  Shooting is fast and accurate, you can move while aiming and reloading and most important you move and strafe like in a shooter, not like some other genre.  Enemy variance is great in the game and each enemy type requires different tactics and is more suited to certain weapons, which offers a lot of variety and challenge like the shooters of old.  Small toddler-like aliens call for fast spray shooting while large hulking beasts call for precision and dodging.  Toward the end of the game many different types will be thrown at you at once, creating hectic and exhilirating moments where you have to quickly decide how to handle who, and with what.Other than shooting creepy enemies that come from the dark you will do a lot of exploring in Dead Space 2.  Exploring in all dimensions using the new anti-gravity freedom of movement is awesme fun and a great addition to the game; I looked forward to these flying sections throughout the entire game.  All the environments this time around are much more varied as you explore a space station, not just a ship.  You will go through residential areas, commercial areas, churches, military bases, mining colonies and a few surprises along the way.  While the original Dead Space felt like one big engineering section Dead Space 2 has variety and better level design on the whole, plus there is no repeating of areas like in the original game.  You also get to choose from various suits throughout the game, which offers up some bonus variety on top of the 10 or so weapons on offer (you can carry four at once).  Exploring every area of the beautiful levels hoping to find a new suit or weapon is great fun.Speaking of beautiful levels, Dead Space 2 is a looker.  The thing that really stands out in the game is the brilliant lighting effects which, at max settings on the PC, can really knock your socks off.  Shadows are rich and wonderful, black as night and deep as the ocean.  The design of the levels backs up the graphical splendor as well and I was constantly pausing to see the unique \"junk future\" design play with the lighting and effects.  One standout moment is fighting in a hallway illuminated only by a large advertisement for the future transport system, it's jingle repeating as the graphic constant refreshes itself, sprinkling light along the walls as you dodge alien zombies.  Dead Space 2 uses design and effects to constantly give you these little standout moments.For the PC Dead Space 2 is a better, yet still basic PC port.  The original Dead Space was bashed by many PC gamers for having deliberately slow and cumbersome aiming which for many felt uncomfortable with a mouse.  Dead Space 2 does not suffer from this issue and mouse aim is excellent and fast throughout.  Dead Space also lacked the ability to reassign keys to some areas like the number pad, but Dead Space 2 seems to allow full customization.  There was a v-synch bug in Dead Space which causes massive issues when v-synch was on but Dead Space 2 does not suffer nearly as much (though v-synch does still limit the framerate and cause minor floaty feelings, so you might want to turn it off anyway and try forcing it with your graphics hardware... on nVidia this fixed all the issues for me).  There are many graphical settings for shadows, effects, depth of field, blur and more.  You will have to force AA and AF through your control panel unfortunately, but on nVidia both do work.  The game uses SolidShield DRM which has to activate at install and then deactivates when you uninstall, giving you 5 concurrent activations at any one time.  It's annoying and pointless (and easily fixed if you desire to) but I don't let DRM effect the score.Overall Dead Space 2 is a brilliant game I consider to be an instant classic.  If you like sci-fi shooters, creepy horror games and exploration then you will surely love Dead Space 2.  The PC port is better this time and the game is a solid 12 hours long for one playthrough on normal, so what are you waiting for?  Dead Space 2 is worth the cash, worth your time and not just a great game but a great PC game.  I thoroughly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2011"}

It is nothing like any Metal Gear game in the franchise.  Ever since the Nintendo days, MG has been about stealth.  The idea was sneak first, kill second.  This title is the complete opposite.  There is no &#34;sneaking&#34; to be found in this game.  It's all about hacking and slashing, killing and destruction.  And it's fun.If you're a Metal Gear purist, this game may be upsetting to you.  Don't get me wrong, this game has certain nuances that are callbacks from the old MG games.  You will still see the exclaimation points above the enemies when they spot you and there is still the timer that counts down until you are no longer in an exposed state, for example.  However, this is really pointless since you can't hide from anyone anyway, and you'll be killing everything on the screen anyhow.  You'll still get to hear the terrible voice acitng, along with most of the sounds that are present in the older games.  But that's about it.MGR is basically an over the top hack and slash game that emphasizes violence...which is fun!  The story is convoluted and fairly senseless.  The character designs are...outrageous.  I mean, Raiden wears high heels and is in serious need of a barber.  Again, the voice acting is laughable.  The camera can be annoying at times.  However, all of these little annoyances don't overshadow the entertainment value of the game.  It really is fun to slice enemies in to halves, thirds or quarters - which is literally possible in MGR.  The game sort of feels like Ninja Gaiden, without the high level of difficulty.Overall, I like the game.  It's not your typical Metal Gear, but it's fun nonetheless.  If you're looking for a stealth title, you should probably wait for the new Splinter Cell later this year.  If you're all about hack 'em up, gratuitous violence, then this game is for you.PROS- nice visuals- controls are smooth and easy to master- lots of violence!CONS- voice acting is laughable- story is...what story?- Raiden seriously wears high heels (WTF?)- camera can be a pain at times","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

Denick","summary":"A broken camera ruined one of my favorite series","reviewText":"Resident Evil has been one of my favorite series, ever since the debut on the PlayStation, way back in 1996. I have eagerly awaited each (main) entry in the series, and I felt that each new title was an improvement over the previous one. #1 was shocking in its novelty, #2 (battling a giant croc in the sewers, among other things) was an absolute blast, and #3 (constantly fleeing from Nemesis) was thrilling. #4 was a quantum leap for Resident Evil, and it was exciting to see how vastly improved everything had become- the pacing, the controls, the camera, the combat, even small things, like the inventory system. Although #5 had its critics, I feel that it's the best in the series, taking all the improvements of #4, and improving upon them with HD graphics, and a stunning attention to detail.But as for #6... I have no idea what happened, and this is, unfortunately, my least favorite of the series. This is not a good Resident Evil game... in fact, it's not a good game, by any standard. The most glaring sin here is a bizarre camera that ultimately makes the game unplayable for me. For some strange reason, Capcom chose to ignore the conventions of standard TPS camera rules. Instead of placing the camera at a reasonable distance behind your character's shoulder, it's jammed right up against them. This results in jerky, choppy motions when you turn from side to side, and for the first time in my life, I experienced motion sickness while playing a game. Another disadvantage of this approach is that it makes the graphics look far worse than #5, since the camera is constantly jammed up against every texture, leaving no room to cover the blemishes (the still photos look nothing like this game's poor performance in motion). Furthermore, you can't even see around you... your visibility is so severely limited, it's the final straw in making this game unplayable for me.I had been eagerly anticipating this game since its announcement, but I can't even continue playing it. I am beyond disappointed. Capcom, please go back to the approach used in #4 and #5, and please consider releasing a patch that would enable a traditional third person camera in this game. I don't know if such a patch is possible, but it could very well save this game. I know there's a good game in here, somewhere... now you just need to make it playable for us!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

Punishment: Star Successorbrings one of a kind shooter gameplay created by the undisputed masters of the genre.","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"one of the best action games ever","reviewText":"fans of the original sin and punishment will remember it as an avant-garde shooter that pushed the limits of the n64 both graphically and gameplay-wise to the breaking point, resulting in one of the most memorable and intense shooters ever made. star successor does all that over again and more on the wii, building on the foundation of the original to create a game that surpasses it in every way.if you've never played the original, you're in for a real mind warp; the hallmarks of the series- the fast pace, high difficulty, ever-changing gameplay and sheer number of enemies on screen at once- are incomparable to anything else out there and the extra power provided by the wii has been used to it's fullest to absolutely drench the screen in robots and gunfire; starfox, even on it's hardest levels, is a walk in the park compared to this.--the game is played by controlling one of two human(ish) characters, isa and kachi, by either walking and jumping on the ground or hovering in the air with a jetpack. you'll be penalized with a halt of your score counter while using the jetpack (it climbs continuously while on the ground), but otherwise you're free to make the choice to take to the air anytime without any restrictions, and the ability to do so is extremely liberating.your main weapon is a rapid fire laser that can be charged periodically to unleash devastating attacks, with each character's attack being charged in a different way; kachi will lock onto multiple enemies at once and deliver moderately powerful missiles to each, while isa fires a single atomic blast. in addition to different charge attacks, each character's laser works a little differently as well, with kachi using a slightly more powerful blaster that automatically locks onto nearby targets and isa using a fully manual gun. both have their advantages, and after completing certain events in the game you'll even be able to mix between the two.the gameplay has an arcade feel to it, although no arcade shooter would have the balls to be this difficult- even on easy, the game will overwhelm a new player. the goal is to shoot as many enemies as possible to build up a high score, with multipliers awarded for destroying more enemies while keeping your character unharmed. your weapons are unlimited in their ammo, and you also have a ever-useful sword that can be used to cut down those who get too close and even deflect enemy projectiles back (and get mega points in the process).the game supports any controller you can plug into the wii, with gamecube and classic controller setups faithfully mimicking the controls of the original. however, it's not likely that you'll be using anything but the wii remote; of all the shooters out there that demonstrate a pointer's advantage in speed over dual analog, this game makes by far the clearest case for wiimote superiority. the remote also simplifies the utterly complicated controls that had been necessary for independent aiming and character movement in the original, giving a game that was once a challenge just to control a comfortable and clean scheme.---the game is technically on rails, with your character advancing through the level automatically while you focus on shooting, however calling it a rail shooter does the game a disservice. having a character that you can control on screen makes a world of difference in the amount of depth to the gameplay, requiring you to dodge attacks while simultaneously aiming and firing, giving the player so many tasks to do at once that manual advancement through the level would be a brain overload. there are, however, side scrolling moments where the game is taken off it's rails and you're allowed to progress through the level yourself, unexpectedly shaking up the formula and landing the game into a genre all of it's own.each stage is enormous and constantly changing, rarely going more than one to two minutes without a change in scenery, enemies, or entire perspective for that matter- like mario galaxy, the game will effortlessly switch between 2D and 3D multiple times within the same level. you'll find yourself flying through an underwater tunnel made of nothing but air one moment, navigating a side scrolling weapons factory full of robotic horrors the next, and riding a hovercycle on a post apocalyptic highway and fighting a warship in an ocean of lava after that. boss fights are so frequent that you'll typically be facing 3 or 4 within a single level, with some stages having as many as 8; simply put, the game makes it hard to get bored.the graphics throughout every level are amazing, not just for how good they look but also because of the sheer amount of work going on behind the scenes to handle such a technically ambitious game, and this can be considered one of those games that shows off what the wii is really capable of. the art direction is just as impressive, with unique character and enemy designs, inspired settings, and astonishing detail put into even the littlest facets of the enormous levels.--each of the game's 8 stages typically last 20 minutes, and with the unyielding intensity of the gameplay you may have to remove your fingers from the remote with a pair of pliers by the end of each one. the entire game can be beaten within around 7 hours, however, a game like this isn't made to be beaten. it's made to be beaten, memorized, and beaten again until you reach the highest score you're capable of. seeing just how well you can do and pushing yourself to improve your performance is where the real fun of the game lies, and those who take up that task will find limitless replay value- as of this writing i've clocked in over 130 hours and i'm still not bored.the game is not without small flaws; at times it seems to be too ambitious for it's own good, with some camera changes taking place at the wrong time, shots failing to register or deflected missiles flying in the complete opposite direction of where you were aiming, but these only become noticeable when you play the game obsessively and even then they're a minor nuisance. overall, the game is a challenging, rewarding, and uniformly excellent masterpiece unlike anything you've ever played before or will likely ever play again. it's exactly what wii owners have been demanding, a game made for and by only the most serious players out there, and if you consider yourself to be one of them this game is a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

I started playing it in 2007 but was stymied by the load times. I restarted it in 2009 with the Enhanced Edition and got about halfway through before being frustrated into abandoning the game. Finally, I recently resumed the same save and managed to finish the game off once and for all. This tells you two things: that the game is so annoying that giving up is a viable option, but that it's also good enough to drag players back after years to finally complete it.The game's structure is traditional: there's an opening action sequence which doubles as a tutorial, where an amnesiac Geralt is re-trained in the ways of witcherdom whilst fending off enemies. There's then a sequence of large, semi-open areas where you can follow the main storyline or pursue many (and I mean many) side-quests to help build up Geralt's funds and experience (which improves his skills). Unlike some mainstream RPGs, The Witcher sometimes prevents the next part of the main quest from triggering until you've completed some more side-missions, for both story purposes (characters and events from apparently unrelated side-quests have a tendency to become hugely important in the main storyline hours later) and mechanical ones: this game is tough and unforgiving, and Geralt needs every scrap of experience he can get to get through the game. Another major twist to the structure is that consequences do not immediately follow decisions: in some cases a dozen hours may pass before the outcome of a previous decision becomes clear, by which time you've committed to it. This prevents the, 'make decision, see village immediately explode, reload to make alternate choice' approach which works in other games.Geralt spends a lot of his time talking to people and in combat (and sometimes talking to people whilst in combat). The talking part is okay, although the game assumes a greater familiarity with the source material (Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher books and short stories) than most players in the UK and USA will have. Sapkowski is a European superstar who has sold millions of books from Spain to Russia, but in English he remains relatively obscure. Fortunately, the amnesia storyline means that most characters will reintroduce themselves (if rather briefly) on the first meeting and the rest of their development takes place as the game unfolds, which is more naturalistic and convincing than most RPGs where characters will introduce themselves with massive infodumps about themselves and the world. The characterisation is surprisingly nuanced and, though most characters have huge flaws, they usually have laudable aspects as well. When Geralt is presented with the choice of siding with the human-supremacist Order of the Flaming Rose or the elf/dwarf rebels, the choice is complicated by the primary Order character being a reasonable, honourable guy who might be able to moderate the Order's extremism and by the rebels, though having a just cause, being indiscriminate terrorists who kill civilians and soldiers alike. Whichever side you choose, or if you choose to stand aside, there will be both good and bad (but mostly bad) consequences regardless.Combat is cheerfully horrible. Most RPGs have you clicking on an enemy and constantly fighting until you throw in a special move or maybe some magic or potions. The Witcher has you clicking for each sword move and being able to chain attacks together to create combos that inflict massive damage. This is fine, but the game seems to be pretty random in when it recognises a mouse click or not, and some chains unleash some unfeasibly long animations in which it's unclear if your mouse clicks are having any effect and other enemies are hitting Geralt continuously. Beat 'em up style combat in an RPG has worked very well before - in Jade Empire - and since - in Dark Souls - but in The Witcher it doesn't really work at all. This is not helped by the fact that getting through the game on any difficulty higher than Easy also requires the use of alchemy to make potions and bombs. For those who find alchemy mind-numbingly dull and don't fancy spending a fifth of the game picking flowers, there's no easy way around this. It also doesn't help that alchemy often completely destroys balance. After trying to get through the game's climactic fight with an evil wizard several times through combat alone and dying horribly, I downed one of the basic potions in the game (make me invulnerable to knockdowns) and promptly killed him in less than a minute.Fortunately, magic is handled a lot better and is deceptively powerful: The Witcher's spells are rarely visually impressive but they do tend to pack a lot of damage once you've put more skill points into them. Frankly, without magic (and my trusty Ignii spells) I would not have been able to complete the game as combat alone is so astonishingly terrible. The game is also refreshingly conservative in giving you skill points, with it being almost impossible to max out more than a couple of skills in a single playthrough. This forces more tactical decisions on where to put your advancement points. The game also avoids some unnecessary inventory management (fortunately, as your inventory is absolutely tiny) by giving Geralt two special swords at the start of the game which are periodically upgraded. This prevents you from having to stat-compare every sword you find on the off-chance it's better, unlike other RPGs like Dragon Age.Graphically, the game looks pretty good. Though based on the ancient Aurora Engine (first used for the 2002 game Neverwinter Nights), CDPR have completely reworked it to produce far more stunning visuals. It still looks pretty good today. The motion-captured combat animations are also astonishing. Clicking the mouse like a nervous rodent may be tedious, but the results with Geralt rolling, spinning, kicking, back-swiping and occasionally knocking enemies back with the hilt before decapitating them are all smooth and stylish. There's a fair amount of blood in the game, but unlike Dragon Age it doesn't go berserk and leave you coated in gore after every fight. The graphics in the swamp (despite it being the most annoying RPG gaming location of all time) are extremely atmospheric, the lighting is great and the game nails the atmosphere of a medieval city convincingly.Aside from the combat and occasionally non-existent explanations for what the hell is going on, the game's biggest flaw is its confused approach to gender politics. The game features several strong female characters and women are shown working as soldiers in armies and having tremendous magical powers. However, it also allows Geralt to have sex with about half of female characters in the game (with no consequence: witchers cannot bear children due to the drugs they have to take to gain their powers, and Geralt's proper long-term girlfriend is pretty broad-minded) and collect 'cards' to show the success of his conquests. Female characters (both human and not) also appear fully nude in the game whilst the men (and Geralt) keep their clothes on at almost all times. It's a tawdry and weird thing to put in the game, though arguably the open-minded approach to sex and sexuality is refreshing compared to its non-existence in most other games.In summary, The Witcher (***) looks good, has a refreshingly focused storyline (no 'save the world' nonsense here) and some really impressive character development. Its depiction of choice and consequence is up there with Black Isle/Obsidian at their best, and its moral ambiguity is refreshing after so many tediously moralising games where everything is either good or evil and nothing inbetween. On the negative, it has a confusing attitude towards sexism, the combat is utterly atrocious and the game is a little over-reliant on fetch quests and toing and froing between a relatively small number of locations (the game gets a lot of mileage out of limited assets without being too obvious about it). It's also far too long, clocking in north of 50 hours to complete. What it does do, however, is shake CRPGs out of their complacency and bring some very interesting new ideas to the table. Despite the negatives, it's definitely worth playing. Its sequel is The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, available now. The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt will conclude the saga when it is released in 2014.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

When my brother was home for spring break, he introduced me to CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2 and I was hooked.  The overall storyline of the campaign is done extremely well.  It's a great story and would make a great movie.  Until now, the movie RED DAWN offered the best scenario of an invasion of America in any media.  CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2 tops that by quite a bit.  It's so engaging. The twists and turns of the plot are quite simply, enthralling. Of course, not all of the action takes place in America.  The various characters that a player plays find themselves fighting in Afghanistan, Russia, Brazil, and a battle on a platform at sea. Silenced snipers, heartbeat sensors, and television-guided missiles are just some of the pieces of unique equipment that characters use during the course of the campaign.The game can be played on three different levels: regular, hardened, and veteran.  Unlike many games, the regular level is actually rather difficult to complete. Compared to other games I've played, it's like playing at least a moderate if not an expert type mode.  The only con about the campaign I have is that there are a few moments in the game that are too programmed allowing for no real involvement from the gamer. I'd rather just see a cut scene to speed things up rather than just have to push a button.Besides the campaign, CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2 also includes a variety of special ops missions and multiplayer play.  Not all of the special ops missions are available at the beginning and can only be unlocked by earning a certain number of stars.  The multiplayer games are mostly variations of the games found on a typical shooter game, e.g. capture the flag, team death match.I immensely enjoyed playing CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2.  It's a great shooter game that features an intense and engaging campaign plot.  The only caveat is that it's not a game for younger children because of the violence (depending on maturity level, I'd say the youngest kids that should play the game are 3rd or 4th graders).  Other than that, I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a shooter game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2010"}

This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions.

As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"closing in on the perfect game","reviewText":"The Grand Theft Auto games have always been on the frontier of gaming, each new title pushing closer to what we all really want a game to be -- fully realistic, fully immersive, with infinite replayability and expansion potential, particularly in the multiplayer arena. Basically, a game is craved where a whole realistic world is available to explore and play around in with unlimited things to do in it -- something no shooter will ever be able to achieve, no matter how good the graphics. Grand Theft Auto 4 comes closer to this ideal than almost any other game, yet falls far short ... in other words, it's about the best game that can be made right now.But first, a comparison: while this is a much better product than any of the previous Grand Theft Autos, it is not the most entertaining. San Andreas can still claim that honor, and I personally enjoyed Vice City much more, though it is rudimentary by today's standards. There are a few reasons for this; first, better graphics does not necessarily make a better game. It only makes a better looking game. Second, the best thing about the earlier titles isn't here -- why is Nico a moral hero? Is that more fun? The whole point of the early GTA titles was playing as a guy outside all of society's limitations -- a murderer, a drug dealer, a cop-killer, etc., wheareas this hero has a sort of warped conscience. All of a sudden you're playing a hero, just like in any other game. Second, we want to change as we play, we want to put different clothes on and learn different skills, as we could do in San Andreas, but as we cannot in this new Liberty City. We want to tattoo Nico and cut his hair but cannot. And we want a point to side missions, a good reward -- because let's face it, once you've gone on a few dates and achieved your health bonus or whatever, keeping on with it is boring. Finally, the auto part of this game, probably because of the improved graphics, is not nearly as fluid as that in the earlier titles, even as far back as GTA 3. It's just not as fun driving around, particularly on a motorcycle. Whatever is going on with the motorcycle controls in this game, even when you finally learn them, it's still not any fun to drive around.Now the positive: the story is fantastic, and the actors the best yet, bar none. The screenplay might not be as funny as those of the previous titles, but it's deeper, richer, and altogether more satisfying. There are a couple genuine choices you need to make that effect the game from that point on, and the story itself is surprisingly large -- probably twice that of San Andreas. Also, the shooting system is beautiful, the best yet. Very natural, with more weapons and fights where Nico spontaneously rants at and berates his attackers if they manage to hit him. The city is finally a true Liberty City, a huge metropolis with hundreds of streets to explore. And for the first time, multiplayer is possible. It's not particularly good, especially when compared to Red Dead Redemption, but it's possible.My overall impressions of this game were, I wish they had spent a little less time on how things looked, and a little more time on what you could do, but it is still about as fun a game as you can buy these days ... And will tide you over until Grand Theft Auto 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"Still Golden--Even if Some of the Shine Has Faded","reviewText":"In May of 2006 Nintendo released New Super Mario Bros.  A game that came back and introduced younger players to Mario's roots while appealing the nostalgia of older players.  It worked.  Better than anyone could've hoped for.  It quickly went on to become one of the best selling video games of all time.  Just a couple of years later Nintendo then released New Super Mario Bros. Wii adding in a lot of multiplayer support and bringing back even more nostalgia while also making a pretty challenging game.  New Super Mario Bros. 2 on the 3DS is the follow up to the original DS classic and it's good.  But by now New Super Mario Bros is starting to lose it's luster.The story is, as always, that Princess Peach has been kidnapped and once again Mario and Luigi have to go and save her.  Mario has been saving the Princess for almost three decades now and it's never going to change.  Mario has never been about story, however, it has always been about gameplay.  This is where New Super Mario Bros. 2 succeeds and... loses some of the allure.By now New Super Mario Bros isn't a way to introduce younger players to Mario's side scrolling roots or a means to appeal to nostalgia.  If you played the other New Super Mario Bros. games there's really nothing \"new\" here.  And that's actually okay by me.  Not every game needs to innovate, but perhaps adding something more might've been nice.  There are six worlds that you'll visit normally with two hidden worlds that can be accessed by going through a different path.  You'll travel across a world map.  About halfway through each world is a fortress and at the end is a castle.  The formula for New Super Mario Bros. hasn't changed one bit.  Some levels have hidden exits that take you off the beaten path to allow you to warp or skip over some levels, but most are beaten the standard way without a hidden exit.  And just like the other two games each level has three star coins for you to find.  And when you have enough you can spend them to unlock the way to a mushroom house for more rewards.  It's all standard stuff for New Super Mario Bros. by now.That's not to say the levels aren't well designed.  They start off pretty basic but pretty soon they become quite imaginative and fun to play through.  Much like the original New Super Mario Bros., however, it's not very challenging at all.  Despite some well designed levels there just isn't much the player has that will really throw them for a loop.  You'll breeze through the game rather quickly.  There is some replay there, but the adventure is over before you know it.Every Mario game seems to have its share of power ups and interesting quirks.  The original New Super Mario Bros. allowed Mario to hop into a blue shell.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii introduced the ice flower and penguin suit.  Even Mario 3D Land gave you the boomerang suit to use.  New Super Mario Bros. 2... doesn't really introduce anything or even try it's hand at doing so.  The only new thing here is the Gold Flower which allows Mario to shoot fire balls that turn bricks into gold coins for him to collect.  The return of Raccoon Mario might have been a nice play on one's nostalgia had Mario 3D Land not brought back the Tanooki suit.  And while Raccoon Mario can run and fly just as he did in Super Mario Bros. 3, it's not really a whole lot added.  The fire flower is back again, but we've never really been without it.  Aside from those power ups though, New Super Mario Bros. doesn't offer up a whole lot.  And this means it doesn't really have a lot of variety here from a gameplay standpoint.Nintendo usually tries to put something in there to keep you coming back, however.  And again, New Super Mario Bros. 2 doesn't quite do enough.  The original New Super Mario Bros. didn't always have a lot to keep you coming back, but it didn't really have to.  There was no bar set.  The Wii variation, however, had a special world that made collecting every star coin worth it to experience eight challenging stages.  It also offered up a multiplayer experience that actually helped it out as well.  Here, the big thing is collecting coins.  And it's about as exciting as it sounds.  You'll spend most of your time doing this as it is, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 pushes it.  And the game challenges you to get 1,000,000.  It's not a hard challenge, just a tedious one.  The game does all sorts of things to help you along.  You've got the gold flower, but you can also jump through gold rings to turn your enemies gold to the point that they'll drop more gold coins (and gold koopa shells that you kick leave a trail).  You can also bump blocks and carry around a gold block on your head that gives you more coins as you run around.  So there are plenty of means by which you can reach one million coins.  It'll just take time to do it.  In the process, of course, you'll easily rack up several lives.  I had more than thirty lives after just the first four stages alone.  The sheer number of lives you'll accumulate by default makes one wonder why Nintendo decided to pity players who die too much.  If you fail a certain number of times, you'll get the White Tanooki suit which will make you invincible in the level.  Considering how simple the game is and the untold number of lives you'll earn by default it's a wonder why it was necessary to include this.The thing about this emphasis on collecting coins is that you never really feel it adds a lot to the game.  Collecting coins in Mario is so basic.  We've been doing it since the first game and most times they've either only been seen as a means of getting more lives or, in some cases, a trail to lead us to a goal or show us where to go.  But collecting one million doesn't seem as though it will do much.  It just seems like a way to get you to keep playing.  And while just about everyone will probably take to the challenge, it does get incredibly monotonous after a while.  You're more likely to just play through it as you did any other Mario game not really caring about how many coins you've collected.That's not to say any of that is bad.  It just doesn't add a lot to the experience of the game.  The levels themselves are extremely well designed and there are A LOT of levels that one can play through.  Levels contain hidden exits to take you off the beaten path.  There are hidden worlds to explore as well.  It's not exactly a \"long\" game but it is one that can keep you busy for quite some time because there is plenty of reason to keep playing.  Either to actually collect the one million coins or to obtain all the star coins and find all the hidden exits.  There's reason to revisit levels when you're done.The multiplayer feature from New Super Mario Bros. Wii returns as well.  If a friend with a 3DS and a copy of the game wants they can help you traverse the stages here.  It's not quite as much fun as the Wii version in this regard.  And like the Wii version there will be times when you'll get in one another's way more so than not.  Also like the Wii version there's not much extra you get from actually playing multiplayer.  So it's not forced on you to actually complete the game.  There isn't much emphasis put on the multiplayer here, though.New Super Mario Bros. 2 looks really good as well.  It looks about the same as it did on the Wii.  Which means it's pretty and has a lot of nice smooth textures.  Those who play this game won't notice much of anything being animated differently from the Wii version.  Likewise, because it's a side scroller the 3D adds nothing to it--and really it shouldn't have to.  It's a pretty looking game, to be sure, there just isn't anything here you haven't seen before.The music, as you might've guessed, is also pretty much the same.  And like before, the enemies will dance to the beat of the music sometimes as well.  Nearly everything here is remixed from previous games in the New Super Mario Bros. lineup.New Super Mario Bros. 2 is still a really good game.  Mostly through great level design.  The good stuff about Mario doesn't cease to be good.  It's just hard not to wish Nintendo could've done more to it than simply seeing how many coins you could collect.  The gameplay is still solid as ever, and the adventure is still fun.  It's just a shame that New Super Mario Bros. 2 doesn't do much to expand from the previous iterations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Bart Motes","summary":"A mixed bag","reviewText":"The mark of a great game is that you play it for hours and hours, maybe even get obsessive about it. Well, the unit I received for review was a crippled demo version, so the playing for hours and hours wasn't an option.What's in the package:* I received a wired turntable controller. To quote one of the songs from the 3 song demo: that's so 2000 and late. The box notes that the final version includes a wireless controller, but I cannot speak to that for obvious reasons.*The controller combines amazing quality and really crappy quality. The turntable itself is really great: solid feel and there are raised ridges on the side to give you a real sense of spinning. Some thought and care went into this. Also, the turntable looks to be removable from the controller, so expect to be able to buy fancier turntables. On a less bright note, it was literally impossible for me to open the battery compartment on the controller. I used a knife and everything. It's stuck in place. Hopefully the wireless controller will not have this problem. On the other hand, I can't promise you that the wireless controller will have the same quality turntable.* Demo disc. This demo only contains 3 songs for solo play, plus one more for linked play with a guitar hero controller.Gameplay:* Very similar to Guitar Hero, you hit combos and have to \"scratch\" the same way you would strum on the guitar. Crossfading is interesting and not that easy to get right.*As another review noted, the gameplay is binary: you get it right or you don't. This makes sense in Guitar Hero, where you either hit the right note or you don't, but not so much sense for a DJ, who operates in a state of kind of creative destruction.*Speaking of creativity, it seems like the designers missed an opportunity to allow players to deviate from the standard mix. It would be interesting to have an option to change between different mixes or even to stutter different mixes along the way: give the player the option to switch up the song if the crowd doesn't appear to be feeling it.*I can't comment on the \"campaign mode\" if you will, because the demo only has three songs. But when the designers are thinking of ways to improve this product, consider a campaign in which you start DJing in your apartment then graduate to really small venues with only two or three people on a sleepy thursday night, to a packed club, to an amphitheater, etc.*The demo gave the option of picking one of two characters. There were some options for customization, but they were locked on the demo, so I can't comment on whether they will fulfill people's need for expression or not.*The demo includes a mix of the legendary Benny Benassi with the Black Eyed Peas. Pretty good. The complete set list, included to taunt us looks promising, but a lot of the mix choices are questionable. I don't know who told them that every track needs to be a mashup.....The good: Cut Chemist, DJ Shadow, Daft Punk, and Benny Benassi. Missing in action, among others, Armand Van Helden and Paul Oakenfeld. The weird and questionable: Queen is the versus for like 5 songs. Really? Queen? The possibly amazing, possibly terrible: Tears for Fears Shout vs Eric Prydz Pjanoo and the Killers Somebody Told Me versus Rihanna Disturbia.In conclusion, the game is fun but not amazing. I hate to harp on the demo version, but whoever made that marketing decision really messed up: you mailed reviewers a fairly expensive controller but didn't give us a full version of the game to evaluate? Very strange. And worse of all, it raises the question: would you buy the full version of this game? My answer: probably not.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"A great idea with bad execution.","reviewText":"I grew up loving the hardboiled detective film noire types of movies so when I heard about this I was quite excited since it was right up my alley.Sadly though the end product is nothing like it could have been. This is basically a snooze fest disguised as a game. Honestly, if it didn't have Rockstar's name on the box it wouldn't be rated highly as it is or sold as well despite the fact Rockstar did not make this game.My main dislikes with the game are.......1- You never really detect anything. You walk around till you get a little chime meaning you press the x button and pickup the clue. If the clue needs to be examined further the game will tell you so. Once you have the clues your partner will signal you it's time to go somewhere else. The game basically walks you through detecting everything and finding clues. It tells you when you need to hit what buttons and where.2- You can't mess up interrogations. This was lauded as a big feature for the game. If you blow the interrogation then you just do it again. Even if you guess wrong when your judging a person's true intentions you can still win the game without ever getting one right. You can go right through the game by guessing everything wrong when its decision time while interviewing someone. The game basically won't let you make mistakes that stop the game play and there are no consequences for anything during interrogations. There is no need to study a person's facial reactions or what they say because it doesn't matter. Guess right? No advantage. Guess wrong? No punishment.3- The facial animations while good are just a gimmick. Another big selling point for the game is just a gimmick. Again looking at people's faces during interrogation to guess if they are lying or not doesn't matter since you don't have to be right. The facial animations are nice but it doesn't matter aesthetically because their bodies still move like stiff puppets. And they still aren't lifelike because they are over exaggerated to be noticeable. I personally wish they hadn't wasted all the money on filming actors in a fancy studio with all this high tech equipment and instead used the money to hire better writers for the game and work on making it more fun instead of just being a gateway for their facial animation tech. Honestly the animations felt more like a tech demo they were hoping to get other developers to license the tech for their games.4- The game is incredibly linear. Yes a couple times you can chose to shake down a bartender instead of checking up on a drug addict but you never really get to chose anything. The game firmly holds your hand from the start to the finish and never let's go. I felt more like a errand boy out driving from point A to point B and then from C to D.5- The storyline while not bad isn't that great. The main storyline starting out builds and builds and builds then suddenly it just stops and comes to a half with a very paper thin plot excuse and then suddenly you thrust off in another direction with no looking back. They just go to all this trouble of building up to something and then suddenly pull the rug out and leave you unsatisfied. The ending is very, very unsatisfying as well.6- Team bondi has been saying the game isn't finished and that's easily noticeable just playing through it. They left the game kind of shallow in order to sell more DLC to gamers and that's obvious since they have been releasing DLC since its release and have recently announced more. It's just a shame they would release a 60 dollar game partially gutted so they can sell DLC and turn it into a 100 dollar game.7- 60% of the game is still just grand theft auto. Just like in grand theft auto you have to drive a car for hours and hours and hours while you playing doing absolutely nothing but going up and down the same boring streets as a time sink. You can take any car you want like in GTA, you'll waste hours of time driving just like GTA, when you run it's just like in GTA, when you shoot or fight it's just like GTA, in fact everything that isn't investigating or interrogating is just like GTA.In the end this game is wasted potential. I really wish I had waited till it eventually drops to 25 bucks or less because that's all it's worth. I had a lot of fun for about 6 hours and after that I find myself playing it just to finish it since I paid so much. I was really disappointed in this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CRM3RI","description":"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Warsis the highly anticipated first game in theGTAfranchise designed for play on the Nintendo DS. But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

I bought Vagrant Story over a year ago.  Tried it, like the battle system, and then found myself hating it.The game play goes as follows: You start in a dungeon...there are cut scenes from time to time, but none of them make any sense...you run around by monsters and fight.  You see the monsters as you are fighting them as there are no random battles.  A menu pops up after you click near a monster such as, Head: 0, 100%, Right Leg: 2, 85% and so on.  From there you choose which part of the body you want to attack.  Sometimes you make NO hit points against the monsters because you have to work up your weapons for each type of monster.  And it is impossible to make a master weapon against all monsters.  More than one weapon has to be leveled up for different monsters, and many times weapons have to be changed in midst battle which is annoying.  The other complaint I had in this game is that the only way you can heal yourself is either finding a save point or using a curing item.  This doesn't sound so bad, but curing items CANNOT be purchased.  Instead they only can be found fighting monsters.  I never seemed to have enough curing items.  By the end of the game, things still didn't seem to make sense.  The conclusions were unsatisfying and overall pain in the neck.The last complaint I have of this game is the feeling I got from playing it.  The color scheme is bad.  Everything was shades of brown or blacks and occasional greens and reds.  It was a depressing feel to it, and it seemed like I never saw the light in that game.However, I can still give this game some credit.  I believe that it was an attempt of a good thing.  There were bad qualities about it that if only fixed a little, this game could've been great.  The battle system was actually fun at times, but when things got tough and a new type of monster approached, it took way too long to level up a weapon.I thought for its time, the cut scenes looked nice.  There are no special movies throughout the game, just a short one as an intro before you start your game up.It is possible to enjoy this game.  I found myself struggling through it, but I knew a couple who actually half ways liked it.  It isn't a masterpiece in my eyes, but it had potential I think that didn't see the light of day.Pros:Innovative battle systemWell done cut scenes for its timeNew Game Plus + featureCons:Dull game, hardly any change of scenery  besides dungeons and boxesConfusing Plot - (yet it was deep)Bad color scheme: browns, browns, tans, green,and more brownsAnnoying weapon level up systemEstimated time to complete game in a quicker runthrough: 20 - 30 hours.Detailed gameplay estimated time to complete: 30 - 50 hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2004"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

If I hadn't grown up on Mario, and if this were the first video game I'd ever played, I would never want to play another one for the rest of my life.I concur with everything the other reviewers have said about the controls and the camera.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past, it is compelling and very entertaining. The gameplay  is excellent, it's not your typical RPG since this plays like an action/adventure game. I love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like.The game also plays like real life. You can get married, divorced, have sex and buy houses, even decorate them! The game is so real that you can choose to be straight, gay or bi-sexual depending on who you sleep with. The only thing that is missing is that you can't have children, but that should change in future installments. Another cool thing about the game is that the more evil you get, the more people are afraid of you. But, the more of a hero and savior you become, you are greeted with praise and clapping in every town you go to.Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE!!! The replay value is extremely high. I have played and beat the game many times and I'm still not tired of it! If you love RPGs or hate RPGs this is still fantastic.

What should have resulted was one fantastic game.The actual result, unfortunately, was nothing remotely similar to what I just described. The frame rate of Hunted is a juderring, shuddering mess that seems as if it never saw the light of the Quality Control cubicles at whatever developer made this embarrassment. What makes it worse is a horrid color palette that makes everything blend together... characters, environments, items, it doesn't matter what it is, it's all going to get mixed into the pot. Quite literally, I had no idea what I was looking at on screen for most of the time (I lasted two hours, before my eye pain and frustration made me give up on this thing).I don't know if these technical abominations affected the XBOX 360 version, but the PS3 game is completely unplayable, in my humble opinion.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Wonderful console with a bright future ahead!","reviewText":"I got the Deluxe Wii U for Christmas, and let me say, it has not failed to amaze me. The Wii U is a wonderful console, very innovative with a revolutionary controller, and a bright future ahead of it. So let me tell you about my Wii U experience and my thoughts on the console so far. Just a warning, this is a long (but detailed) review.*BEFORE YOU SELL YOUR WII*Before you sell your Wii, THINK FOR A MOMENT. To play ANY games on the Wii U in multiplayer, you will need AT LEAST 2 Wiimotes. Yes, you can do it with 1 Wiimote and the GamePad, but that's not really all that fun. I would recommend keeping at least 2 of your Wiimotes before you sell your old Wii, or simply buy new Wiimotes, they're really cheap nowadays.*SETUP*The Wii U was set up on Christmas Eve. My dad set up the console, so I had to get the details on the setup afterwards. From what I was told, the set up went really smoothly, but the day 1 update took a couple of hours to complete. To be honest, I kind of suspected this, probably because Nintendo's servers were overloaded with people receiving Wii U's for Christmas trying to download the update. (On a side-note, my friend that also got a Wii U said that he had to wait until after Christmas Day to do the update, the servers were so loaded.) I had to sync the Wiimotes, and they synced really fast - only about 5 seconds per Wiimote.*THE CONSOLE*The Wii U itself is basically a sleeker version of the Wii. It has rounded corners, it's shinier, and only a tad bit longer and taller than the Wii. It has four USB ports (2 in front and 2 in back), an SD card slot, and all of the necessary ports needed to hook up the console. The console is also a very quiet little bugger. With no disk in it, the console barely makes a sound. And with a disk in, you can't even hear the disk quietly whirring unless you come to a silent part in whatever your doing, but even then the sound is very faint. It's nice that the console is quiet.*THE GAMEPAD*Okay, there is no doubt about it - the GamePad is revolutionary. It's exceptionally light for how big it is and although it looks clunky, it is very comfortable to hold. The controller looks very well-built. I have three younger siblings. It's been dropped. The screen, analog sticks, and buttons have been slapped out of frustration. Not a scratch has appeared on the thing yet. The GamePad was built to last. All of the buttons are firm. People claim that the analog sticks wobble around when you shake the GamePad but it's really just the stylus jiggling around in it's spot. The analog sticks are much better than the 3DS's Circle Pad, and they are clickable, although I haven't played a game that uses this function yet. The touch screen is very responsive and typing on it is quite easy (the keys are just the right size for my fingers). Don't feel like using your fingers? Whip out the stylus. The TV button on the controller is AWESOME. Simply by pressing the button, you can turn on your Wii U, TV, Cable/Satellite box, change the input, volume, and channel all from the GamePad. This is one universal remote that actually works. Nintendo TVii does have a similar remote but it has more options, however, the TV button is what you have to use to initially turn on your TV if the Wii U is not already on. That comment being said, the Wii U does NOT need to be turned on to use the TV button features. Pressing the button will simply wake the GamePad, and pressing it again will put it back to sleep. The GamePad screen, although not HD, is still very high quality (better than the 3DS). There is absolutely ZERO lag between the TV and the GamePad, and it's really quite amazing how that works. With some games (New Super Mario Bros. U, Scribblenauts, Netflix, Amazon, to name a few), it is really revolutionary how you can simply take what is being displayed on the TV and put it on the GamePad. It's just so darn simple it's amazing. I can play Mario while say one of my siblings watches a DVD. The GamePad's battery life is not stellar, but it really depends what brightness level it's at. I'd say the battery life is about equal to the 3DS's.*WII U MENU (WARAWARA PLAZA)*When you turn on the Wii U and select your user (I'll come back to this), you are greeted by all of the registered Miis on your console. The \"camera,\" so to speak, will then zoom out and you will be greeted by a horde of Miis from all around the world rushing into your WaraWara Plaza and they will all gather around a tile representing an app or game they are playing (NSMBU and Netflix are ALWAYS there). From the WaraWara Plaza, you can see the various Miiverse posts each of these Miis have posted. It's really cool how the Miis interact, such as them having a look of surprise when someone pushes past them, or the way they appear to be talking. While the TV displays the WaraWara Plaza, the GamePad displays the actual menu with all of the options. However, these two can be switched quite easily. Imagine the bottom half of the 3DS Menu on the GamePad screen with something similar to the StreetPass Plaza on the TV. Just one small detail that I really love about the Wii U.*MIIVERSE*For the first time ever, Nintendo has an online social network, called Miiverse (a pun of Mii and universe). When I explain Miiverse to a friend, I say it's \"Facebook for video games but better.\" On Miiverse, there is a different community for each game/app there is, and you can \"favorite\" a community (similar to liking a page). Within each community, you can post something regarding that game/app using the GamePad. However, using the GamePad screen and the stylus, you can draw a picture and post it to Miiverse. There are some REALLY amazing pictures on Miiverse...it's hard to believe how they can make these awesome pictures on the screen. If you go to Miiverse while you have a game suspended, you can put a screenshot of the game into your Miiverse post. I have seen this often with NSMBU - somebody will write \"Where is the x star coin?\" with a picture of them standing next to the level on the world map. Miiverse is simply revolutionary...it's a way to connect to your fellow Wii U owners, it's a way to show your love towards Nintendo, it's a good place to get help with games, the possibilities are limitless.*NINTENDO NETWORK AND USERS*In order to use the functionalities of Miiverse, you need to set up a Nintendo Network ID...sorta like your \"Miiverse Username.\" It's not a very hard process...you just have to enter the basic information that you're asked every time you register for something. YOU WILL NEED A NINTENDO NETWORK ID TO USE MIIVERSE. The Wii U is also Nintendo's first console to offer different users, similar to computer accounts. The console can have up to 12 users (which is reasonable, not many people have more than 12 people using the same exact console) and you can even password protect your user. This feature is quite useful if you have younger siblings like me and you don't want them messing around with your game data and such.*BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY*The Wii U is completely backwards compatible with ALL Wii games and accessories. When you want to play a Wii game, insert the disk and click on the \"Wii Menu\" option on the Wii U Menu. The system will then reboot as a Wii emulator. Something to keep in mind is that your Miis that you made on Mii Maker can NOT be used in Wii mode. If you plan on playing a game that requires Miis, you must make new Miis on the Mii Channel on the Wii Menu. Wii games are actually slightly up-scaled in quality when played on the Wii U...the graphics are slightly crisper and a little bit higher quality (the Galaxy games and Mario Kart Wii have never looked so good).*RANDOM OVERALL THOUGHTS*The HD is glorious. It's amazing to play Nintendo games in fully rendered HD graphics. For the first time in a long time, Mario is not pixelated at all in NSMBU. Everything is crisp and the colors are bright. The console can't play DVDs, but I'm quite sure most people out there have at least one DVD player in the house. My only (yes, ONLY) concern with this system is the slow loading times. Yes, the rumors are true - the Wii U is slow. However, some people are claiming these atrocious loading times such as 30 seconds to load a game...that is not true. It typically only takes AT MOST 10-15 seconds to launch a game. Netflix actually loads faster on the Wii U than it ever did on the original Wii. I'd say the worst offenders are Amazon Instant Video and Nintendo TVii. Amazon takes an eternity to start up (always at least 25 seconds), and the same can be said for TVii. However, Nintendo plans to release 2 system updates in spring and summer to fix the load times, so I will update this review once that happens to talk about the difference. Also, the YouTube app is absolutely pointless. You can only use it to watch videos. You can't view channels, comments, like videos, POST COMMENTS, for that matter...you can only watch videos. Might as well sacrifice the high quality on the YouTube app and watch it on the Internet Browser. My Wii U has frozen up a few times, and unfortunately the only way to unfreeze it is to unplug the system. Most of the times the system froze it was entirely the system's fault, although one time it was my fault...I confused the system in the Internet Browser. Hopefully the upcoming updates will also improve the system's stability.*FINAL THOUGHTS*Overall, the Wii U is a wonderful system. The GamePad is amazing, the graphics are top notch, but at the current time it is slow and can freeze up. But these problems are definitely going to be fixed. It has a very reasonable price for what you get ($350 for an HD console, a giant tablet controller, Nintendo Land, the charging cradle, that's a good deal!). The deluxe is definitely the better way to go but beware - black GamePad equals fingerprint and dust magnet!

I really haven't played Xbox that much; and haven't played the 360 at all. ( I'm a PS2 gamer/'Cube gamer. ) I picked my mission and was on my way. The first thing you notice OBVIOUSLY are the graphics. The graphics are fantastic, and very polished. Anyways here I go with my low-down!Graphics: 9/10. Although extremely great,polished,fresh,and colorful, the bullet holes don't do much, and the blood looks extremely fake.Sound: 8.5/10. It was loud in the mall, but I could hear some of what was going on. The voices are OKAY, the gun sounds are what you would expect from any above-average shooter... you know.Control: 7.5/10. I haven't really gotten used to the Xbox controller yet, but it wasn't TOO bad. I got used to the controls somewhat, but I didn't master them. They aren't bad, but aren't great either.Fun: 7.5/10. There is Co-Op, there is a nice story line, there are nice graphics and sound, but where exactly IS the fun? I mean, it's OKAY, but it's been in the works for quite a long time and I would have expected more. If you're a Perfect Dark fan, buy this. If you are a shooter fan, get Call of Duty 2 for the 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2005"}

The games are coming slowly and it's definitely helping the console get up there.My only gripe involves the Augmented Reality. And it's not that I don't like it - the fact is I Love it, and it presents awesome possibilities for this handheld... unfortunately it doesn't extend beyond basically the the cards that come with the console and that face game.I have been very excited about the Vita's launch games because so many of them work with the AR.  I want to see the 3DS utilize this functionality more but no new games have even been announced yet.That's all though.  Otherwise the console is cool, the camera is awesome, the 3D effect is very solid, the content is pretty extensive (even without many great games, you'll have at least 2 new videos to watch every week in 3D for free).I recommend it if you're looking for a hand-held.  I won't say it's better or worse than the upcoming Vita, I plan on having both, and I plan on utilizing both for their exclusives and strengths.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Welcome to Liberty City","reviewText":"Niko is new to America.  Brought by hopes and promises of his cousin Roman about how wealthy he is.  Unfortunately for Niko he quickly finds the stories to be lies.  Grand Theft Auto IV starts as others in the series with an anti-hero.  Getting involved in doing the wrong things is all to easy in this game.  From the very get go you are learning that living the American life can be difficult and in order to get your story going you must break the law.  For the most part Niko doesn't have a problem with this since he has become raw after being a soldier in war.GTA IV has probably one of the darkest stories so far in the series.  This is not the type of game you will play and comment on how cheerful the story is.  For those of you who have played previous GTA games you will notice many similarities.  From the gameplay mechanics to the story line.  Although people who are new to the GTA series will find how simple the learning curve really is in this game.  The game gives you an incredible amount of tutorials and guides you thru your first several missions making things easy to understand.  Most features in this game are simple to understand and keep this game from getting over anyones learning curve.What has made the Grand Theft Auto series so superb is the story telling.  Excellent voice acting with intense and exciting missions make GTA IV a true winner.  From the first moment on you will notice that you aren't really playing a game as much as taking part in an intense crime drama.  Think Sopranos from the former Soviet Union.  The game is mission based and gives you the ability to choose what you want to do at any given point.  You meet numerous characters who are all about committing crimes and they give you certain jobs.  Of course these jobs increase your reputation and help progress you thru the story.  Along the way you will find numerous characters.  Some you will like and others you will probably want to get rid of yourself.This game has further evolved ideas from previous GTA games.  Niko can not only date one woman at a time but several.  It's really up to you.  Just remember how in real life this can be time consuming it can also be in a game.  You will have woman calling and texting you if you ignore them to long.  Then comes taking them out for dates.  Each woman has different tastes and interests and it's up to you to know where to take them.  Some of the activities can actually be fun like playing darts or pool as these mini games do have learning curves.  The girl you are with will respond to your success or failure at these games.  Obviously there are numerous other activities in wonderful Liberty City.  Also it's important for Niko to accessorize and finding the best clothing to wear is important.  Image is everything as as you progress you get access to better clothes.  The car mechanics have improved in this game but don't expect to have similar handling to a racing game.  What is cool to look at is the amazing detail they have put into the car damage.  Every little ding makes an impact on the car you are in.  Lastly is the music selection.  An incredible 200 songs are available in Liberty City to listen to on the radio.  Numerous radio stations including the talk ones belt out hit songs and comedic advertisements.  Niko even has the ability to watch t.v.  They covered every detail in this game and it shows.As if a single player mode that will take you 30 to 40 hours to beat is not enough there is also online multiplayer.  Yes you and 15 others can play on the beautiful streets of Liberty City.  The multiplayer is truly open ended for your enjoyment.  Several game modes plus the ability to create your own multiplayer.  You can also invite seven friends to take on eight others.  It's easy to say this game will be enjoyed for months on end.  Within six months the 360 will also have it's own unique content that will be available on XBOX LIVE.It's easy to be impressed by Liberty City.  It's as close to New York City as any game has ever got.  From the pedestrians that make up the neighborhood to the realistic design of the buildings.  The weather changes and the days progress realistically.  This is one of those games where you can just take it in and enjoy the scenery.  In Grand Theft Auto you have the freedom to do what you want.  This game is intended for adults.  The language and content can be mature most of the time.  Although that is at a parents discretion.  I wouldn't suggest this game for everyone.  Although I would suggest it for those who have enjoyed previous Grand Theft Auto games.  I would also suggest it for those who enjoy mafia or crime movies.  This game will have you sitting back and enjoying the incredible story.  Just don't forget that it's your story to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

If you plan on playing other shooter games with this gun than I wouldn't get it.If you want to shoot better than choose this gun for House fo the Dead.  It helps you aim at your targets a lot better because you feel the control of the cursor better.  The Wii remote is good choice, but with this gun, you can actually aim with gun sight. Also, I like the feeling with using a gun to play a shooter game.The down side with this gun is it's a bit front heavy. After a week using this gun I got the hang of it and it's not as heavy as before.  It's still heavy sometimes but I sill shoot better with it so I like it. Also, you may feel like holding the gun's front side with your other hand, which actually would help you aim better too.A minior problem with this gun is the trigger isn't as fast as I would like it to be. I think it should be slightly faster so we can fire the gun faster. You don't want to go crazy with it too and start squeezing the trigger too fast or you might break it.I still recommend this gun if you plan on playing House of the Dead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B007M6W3A0","description":"","reviewerName":"MoultonHawk \"Threadstarter\"","summary":"Bar None The Best NBA Sim To Date","reviewText":"Finally this day has come, my most anticipated game EVER!  Why you ask ?  Well I'm a huge bball fan I play the heck out of these games, and the improvements they made this year I just knew from the videos and information I've watched or read it was going to be the best 2K yet.The game opens up with a edit page for My Player.  What is this, where's my intro ?  It takes about 10 minutes to complete your My Player creation, then the intro starts...Jay Z's music kicks in with NBA highlight videos & Jay Z screenshots of him performing on stage; a perfect marriage hip hop & the NBA.  Could Jay be the next Madden?  Once the video ends the main page is shown, your hub; your newly created My Player dancing to the Jay Z song in some chill outfit, haha!  The default OKC vs. Heat matchup, and My Career.  I selected the game and changed the teams to PHX (CPU) vs. NOR.  I heard PHX is surprisingly tough and my online association league I am using NOR so I was geeked to try them out.I immediately switched to the the 2K cam that I couldn't use in the demo (drove me nuts in the demo, broadcast cam ? Ahhh!) and had a blast, the gameplay was smooth, much more so than the demo.  I didn't expect the final game to be so different from the demo, but it thankfully was.  The demo seemed to plod along and to me it seemed like maybe the new dribble stick which is great, would hurt the flow of the game as a result, but that wasn't the case the game flows beautifully !I played on Pro, now Pro isn't a cake walk in past versions.  Playing against the CPU is always a challenge, even on rookie, but it seemed easier to me, which means maybe I can play against the impossible to beat CPU this season. I never am able to play a 2K season because it's not fun losing on pro or all pro when I consider myself an above average player, they don't miss even with good D.  I win 75% of my games vs. random online opponents (quick match)and next to none vs. CPU, it just was frustrating.It seems like Pro is really Pro this time around.Well that's all I got so far gents, it was a blast game that I played, 59-54 NOR, it was 2AM, time for bed.  There's a ton to do in this game and I just scratched the surface, but the Jay Z soundtrack and the gameplay is beautiful and perfect, I know the rest of the features are going to be whipped cream with a cherry on top.  Buy the game with confidence bball fans this game was made for you.  BTW in case you are unaware, NBA Live 13 has been cancelled as of last week, that's a fact not an opinion.Lastly, if you want to test your skill please add me MoultonHawk, PSN.Updated 10/3...There are new rosters coming out this weekend, so if you are going to start an Association, Create A Legend,or My Player, you should probably wait to start so the rosters are more attractive.  For example my SG on Boston is Avery Bradley, he's a PG, and the Lakers still have Barnes (now a Clipper), etc.  My Player hasn't been that fun for me in years past because you start so weak and you get no playing time, but I am going to put the time into it this year. I gave CAL (Create A Legend)a go which seems like My Player in concept but with already created real life players.  I selected Rondo, and when I earned enough VC (your in game currency, pretty much anything you do that isn't practice earns you VC) I gave Rondo Ray Allen's shot; now this is fun!  I played some more online games and I really like the Hornets this year.  I'll usually run with a lesser team.  SAC,MEM,DET are the teams I've used primarly in the past,it might be NOR this year.  All my games were close except when I used Philly and blew out BOS.Updated 10/5...OK there is this addicting new mode in this game that I have yet to tell you about.  It's called MyTeam.  It's similar to Ultimate Team in Madden.  You can make it faster by buying credits and paying for superstars, but that's not me I earn my keep.  Total blast, totally addicted.  So you get delt this team and they pretty much suck and you then can sell them and buy lower end players to start but maybe a player you like; e.g. I started with Willie Green.  I sold him for Wesley Johnson, huge upgrade but very close in VC (your in game currency value).  You can also buy home and away uniforms and attributes with your VC, playbooks, attributes, super icons like defensive stopper, ballhawk etc.  You have to play on a court so you can buy different courts and jerseys, etc.  You also can spend your VC on these surprise boxes of 5 items.  Then once you get your team together you can take them online vs. another created team and battle.  They aren't going to quit cuz you get VC for losing.  I've heard some idiots are paying for DLC instead of earning it and slaughtering people online with superstars I have yet to find those jerks thank goodness.  I only had one bad experience the guy only shot under the basket so frustrating.  They said they spent the most time on this feature this year, and partly because it is completely new, that would make sense.  This years 2K game is FULL of game modes, more than worth your hard earned dollars as long as you are a big bball fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2012"}

You play a photojournalists trapped for 3 days in a suburban mall full of zombies.This game is a mixed blessing. Let's start with all the good aspects. The game is FUN. We've all seen the movies with zombies staggering around, and we've all hung out in malls, feeling bored. Put the two together, and voila! You can walk into any store and grab things to bash the zombies with. Run them over with a lawnmower! Pick up a piece of wood and start swinging! Or, my personal favorite, grab an electric guitar at the music store, whip it around like a fast-moving samurai sword, and hear the TWANG when you make contact!The food system actually makes sense here. You go into food court shops! If you find the food in its base form, it's mildly healthy. If you take the time to cook it, it's even better for you.There's an interesting plot to go with it too. I love that the various humans have names and that you actually learn about them, see their interactions and connect with them. You really care (or at least I do!) when you screw up and they get killed. It gives you a lot of incentive to replay the game to try to get everybody out. If you save a husband and his wife, they have a joyful reunion! It really draws you into the game.So there is definitely a lot going for this game. However, there are a few signs that the game could have used a few more months in testing before it was released. First, we have a large high def TV, so we don't have a problem \"seeing things\". However, I've heard from many of my site visitors that on smaller TVs it's nearly impossible to read words or to understand the text messages. That's just unfair. They should have made the game easily playable even on non-high-def or smaller TVs.Plus, why have to read dialogue at all in a horror game? That really interferes with the immersive quality. If you're knee deep in zombie fighting, you don't want to have to puzzle out what a victim is saying to you. They should just yell it out to you in real time so you can keep swinging while you listen.The real killer here, though, is the loading screen. You take 5 steps. LOADING. You turn around. LOADING. You go up the stairs. LOADING. Good God!! With all the other HUGE map games out on the market that load seamlessly, there is no reason that a mall-based game could not do the same. It might have taken a month of coding time to work that in but it would have been WELL worth it.Also, the save system is questionable. Only one save? One save at all? What if a friend comes over and wants to play forward for the weekend, but you want to be able to have your save spot for your own play after he leaves? You can't? Having just one save spot, in a world with a massive hard drive of storage, is nonsensical.Still, you can deal with those issues, and the game really is a lot of fun. Remember though that it is a MATURE game with zombies with exploding heads and a lot of gore. So if you're a mature gamer who enjoys horror, definitely pick this one up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2006"}

I never really liked RPG's, I'm more of an action gamer, but with all the hype surrounding this game, I figured what the [heck] and rented it a few days after it came out.  I was dumbfounded the first time I played it, I was speachless.  At the time I had never seen graphics like that, and the storyline was so engrossing that I felt a wave of depression actually set over me when I had to take it back.  As pathetic as that sounds, the day I returned it to the video store, I went out and bought Final Fantasy VII and kept playing for days.  Eventually I beat it, then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and I realized I missed a lot of side stuff and extras, so I played through again using the guide, and the experience was even better.  If you have never played any Final Fantasy game before this one is worth picking up, even if you don't like RPG's you'll dig this, though I suggest picking up the BradyGames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter.

It is also similarto GTA IV minus the driving. The game has many RPG elements toit from the Elder Scrolls series of games but is much betterthen even Oblivion.Fallout 3 is a huge game that takes at least 100 hours to playand explore. It has over 100 locations in it and dozens ofcharacters, quests, and enemies if not hundreds.The game features many unique weapons, items, enemies,perks, health items and much more.The story take's place in post war Americathat has been devastated by nuclear war andfallout. You play as the lone wanderer andhave the choice of creating a character toyour liking and giving them attributes,choosing their gender and race, whatthey look like, etc.Fallout 3 has a 1950's vibe and atmosphereto it and a sense of humor not to mentioneaster eggs which makes it quitefun to play.Fallout 3 takes place both outside andindoors in very detailed environmentsand has photo realistic graphics.You can pick locks, hack computers,open lockers, open mailboxes, sleep,eat, rest, drink and can even becomeaddicted to certain chems and drinksin the game.The environments often are as detailedas real life and almost anything thatexists in this world exists inFallout 3.The lighting and environmental effectslike fire, smoke, explosions, day turningto night in real time, seeing the moon atnight, ambient lighting, neon signs andlights are all very amazing to see forthe first time.I also like how the developers added dozensof items and options to restore lost healthin the game such as food, drinks, seeinga doctor, sleeping, vending machines, etc.The game also features power up like itemsthat can prolong your health, make you stronger,etc. such as stimpacks, Nuka Cola, and evenRad X and Rad Away to counter radiationwhich can make you ill and even kill youin certain areas of the game that are highlyradioactive.The characters in Fallout 3 are mostly uniqueand are fun to talk with. You sometimes havemultiple dialog options for each character andthese options can have either negative or positiveconsequences for your character as well as othercharacters as well.The dialog is well written, often funny,and it really does feel as if you are talkingto someone in real life.The main quest in Fallout 3 is interestingto play but the side quests are sometimes themost fun to go on.The sound in the game is pretty good with reasliticsounds and voices for characters, enemies, weapons,eating, drinking, typing on a computer, etc. andsome good music to boot.Enemies include mutants, super mutants, humans,animals, mutated animals, ghouls and robots.Weapons are numerous and include both real lifeguns like a Sniper Rifle and other weapons thatare far fetched like an Alien Blaster Gun.Fallout 3 does have a steep learning curveand many things to learn about such as howto pick a lock or hack a computer which you'lloften be doing in the game as well as levelingyour character to help build up his or her skillsand become more powerful.There are a lot of bugs in Fallout 3 but with patchesthe game plays fine most of them time just save often.My only other complaint about Fallout 3 is the long load timesand lot's of loading screens. Only patient gamers need apply.I think the rest of the reviewers on here said it best.I give Fallout 3 5/5 stars for amazing reply value, greatgraphics and sound as well psychics engine, cool castof characters, good script and hours of dialog anda huge open ended world to explore on your own.It is a blast to play through and explore esp.on a boring day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"ACEMAN1 \"HERE TO PISS YOU OFF\"","summary":"STILL GREAT AND AWESOME 9 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"Before I bought this double pack for my Xbox, I had only played Grand Theft Auto for PSone and Grand Theft Auto III on a friend's PS2.

I can really see why these games are considered some of the greatest ever made because of their innovation, excellent missions, large level of controversy, and of course the car theft.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"The best PS3 launch title is still fun in 2012","reviewText":"When I brought home my shiny, new PS3 console way back in November of '06, there were precious few titles available at the time. From the slim pickings, I selected Resistance: Fall of Man (which seemed like a no-brainer, considering the other options). Turns out, this was a wise decision.Although I was initially a bit underwhelmed during the introduction and the initial moments of gameplay, it didn't take long for me to get sucked into the world of Resistance, and the alternate timeline that it embraces. Of all the Resistance games, this one has the most engaging story, as you struggle to find clues in your ravaged planet. And although I was not initially impressed with the technology on display, I quickly came to see just how powerful this new hardware was, as the screen filled with aliens, bullets, aircraft, explosions, and flying debris- and it ran SMOOTH.One of the very best things about Resistance is that it's an FPS where you DON'T have to kill human beings! I enjoy a good FPS as much as the next guy, but I don't care for the virtual shootouts where I'm forced to kill other people. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the Call of Duty series, but as technology and realism have improved, I always feel uneasy about the violence therein. Resistance cleverly solves this dilemma by letting you cut loose with an incredible arsenal of weapons against an invading alien force that is clearly evil- your payback is fully justified!The creature design is robust and varied, just as you would expect from Insomniac (the creators of the Ratchet and Clank universe). Big aliens, little aliens, mechanized monsters, flying beasties- you name it, it just might be in here. They could have very well called this game \"MonsterFest\" or \"Alien Bash\", and it would have been a fitting title. And since these heinous critters have invaded our home world and are determined to eradicate all your buddies, it's incredibly satisfying to cut loose with a WW2 era machine gun, and blow them to smithereens.Additional weapons include Insomniac's trademark inventiveness, as they apply alien technology to your growing arsenal (favorites include the Bullseye, the Hedgehog, and the Air Fuel Grenade. One brilliant aspect of this game is that it lets you carry as many weapons as you can find (utilizing a weapon wheel, a la Ratchet and Clank), like old school FPS games of yesteryear, forgoing the modern convention of letting you carry only one primary (rifle) and one secondary (sidearm).I've played all the console Resistance games, and this is still my favorite one. To my eye, the graphics are actually better in #1 than in the other two, which suffer from muddiness and brown/gray palettes. The story is tighter, the pacing is excellent, and of course, the idea was completely novel at the time. It's still fun to pick up and play, which speaks volumes about its quality, considering all the FPS titles that have come and gone since 2006. This game does not support trophies, which is actually a nice break, because you don't have to worry about the ones that you \"missed\". Oftentimes available for a mere $10 at online and physical retailers, Resistance is a bargain AND ridiculously fun. Here's hoping Insomniac and Sony release a collection of the titles, like the recent God of War Saga and Ratchet and Clank Collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2012"}

I loved it so much I racked up 2 weeks worth of late fees! Well, of course I eventually bought it. Everything about this game is great and sets the standards for RPGs to come. I'll cut it down for you...Graphics: 5/5The graphics are perhaps one of the best things about this game, especially when it first came out. It uses the same technology that Donkey Kong used and it is at a 3rd person angle. Graphics don't make any game but it sure contributes to this one, Mario has never looked better...ever.Sound: 5/5Yep, the sound is also amazing. Perhaps even better than the graphics. I can still remember the sound at particular parts of the game even though I haven't played it in over a year. The boss music will really stick with you, so will the tadpole pond music. But those are just a few of the places that are memorable. I really think the sound is what did it for me with this game, it just hits you in that classic way. Much like how Zelda: Link To The Past is, or Final Fantasy 3.Gameplay: 5/5Gameplay is also where this game shines. instead of just running around and going place to place like any typical RPG, you can jump, dodge enemies, run into enemies with a Star, even attempt to swim up a waterfall. This game allows for a wide range of actions within the field, among those i just listed. And the camera angle is just right for most of the jumps.Fun Factor:5,000,000/5Yepp, you read that right, five million. The fun factor is the hands down best part about this game. You can race on yoshi, chase a crazy guy up a hill, stomp moombas on pipes, battle optional bosses, attempt 100 super jumps, find hidden items set out by a trio of ghosts, hell, there's almost ANYTHING you can imagine! Although if you have some hang up about immaturity in video games, I would advise you to keep away from this game. This game utilizes every childish tidbit of humor you can possibly imagine, but that is what sets it apart from other RPGs! Instead of having a romantic (hey, that can be great too)storyline, it revolves around Mario and his goofy adventures(but there is a lot more to it), justt ake my word for it, this is the funnest RPG of all time, and probably in my top three as the greatest, maybe even top two!Hell, it may even be the best!Storyline:5/5Even thought he storyline revolves around a comedic plumber the story really cannot get any better than this. You wouldn't imagine a game starring Mario to have character development and backround stories for each one, but it indeed does. Unlike most games, the storyline is also very memorable. Whether its frogfucious admitting to mallow that he isn't his father, or bowzer finally becoming pals with mario, it's all good. If you havent played this game yet, you need to get it immediatly. It is very pricey though, so only get it for around 30 bucks or less...but if you have to pay around 40 it may be worth it. It will probably be a better idea to buy it instead of download it though, because you need to experience the entire game on the original console.Overall : 5/5...just get this game...now! Nuff said.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2004"}

There were some minor annoyances though.  Still it was probably my game of the year because I could not put it down.Now with the second one they improved any minor annoyances and made the game pretty near perfect.1st would be on the 1st game the npc's you got quests from were pretty static.  Here they are fully movable and are doing things while giving you quests.  A big improvement.Next would be that the quests and side quest are all great.  The 1st one had a lot of not that interesting ones and some scavenger hunt ones that weren't that great.  So far in about 25 hrs I have not encountered a dull quest.  Most of the side quests are not to be missed!One of the most annoying thing on the 1st one was you had to press the square button to pick anything up.  Not now.  You can just run over cash and ammo.  Great!!Also the cars in the first one were hard to control while chasing another one in combat.  I think that's why they included the lock on when you press x, because it was to hard to shoot and drive.  Not now.  You can chase the cars and even helicopters like in mad max and blast away with ease.  Also the cars have more umph.Also this one has a lot more variety in enemies and a big one is the variety in landscapes.  The first one was mostly desert.Now for another big change.  A story.  The 1st one was mostly a shooter with a very minimal story.  This one has a pretty big and cool story.I loved the 1st one just wanted to point out how Gearbox went above and beyond to make such a great sequel.Also the bad ass points are pretty cool.  In the 1st one there were all these challenges you could complete like shooting 1000 enemies, running over 10 scags etc.  I am not sure if you got anything, maybe a trophy.  Anyway in the second one you get bad ass pts for completing these challenges and you can use them to very small like .5 increase your shield capacity or critical hit chance and about 15 or so other attributes.  Pretty cool.Also in the 1st one there were certain guns for specific classes.  Here any class can use any gun!  Great.Oh yah for anyone who didn't play the first one.  It has great 1st person shooting mechanics, an open world with tons of quests/missions, you can drive and shoot while driving, you can fast travel to locations you have discovered.  And there are tons of different guns, grenades, and loot.  Also you can level up and spend pts on a attribute tree to build the character you want.Anyway a almost perfect game.  The only complaint I have is the game is so big and takes up a lot of my time.  What is that a complaint.  HA HA.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance.

In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem.

Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

I don't think I'll ever be getting bored with it. If you like Grand Theft Auto IV and westerns, such as myself, you'll be in heaven. Even if you don't care for either of those, the story, characters, locations, and breathtaking graphics will draw almost anyone in. To top it all off, RDR features a massive environment and at least 20 hours of gameplay in single player mode. Aside from the main missions, you can play poker, hunt and skin animals, herd cattle, train horses, kill good or bad guys (depending on if you're taking the hero or outlaw route), duel some unlucky fellow, take on various side quests, or just ride around the gorgeous landscape for hours on end.The graphics and sound are top of the line, even with some minor visual glitches here and there. The voice acting here can't be beat. If you have played the GTA games, the controls here are pretty much the same. Riding a horse can take awhile to master, but I now ride it like a real cowboy.Red Dead Redemption is the best way to experience the wild west. Sure, watching a western movie has it's own rewards, but with this game you actually feel like you're a part of this time in history. This is probably one of my favorite games ever. While God of War III is still pretty great, this is the game of the year by a country mile.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Skyrim: who needs drugs when you have this game?","reviewText":"Greetings!  Yes, this game is ridiculously great.  I'll put this review down in three short parts: (1) for those who are new to the Elder Scrolls; (2) for the veterans of Elder Scrolls / Fallout 3 / sandbox games; (3) general thoughts and comments about the game itself.Quick background: I was madly in love with Morrowind and Fallout 3; I wasn't too crazy about Oblivion for many reasons, which are irrelevant right now.  I loathe standard FPS games with linear storytelling and rinse-repeat trigger-twitching action.  I play old school dungeons and dragons (paper and pencils, yes) and Lord of the Rings is the greatest fantasy tale ever (along with the Belgariad).(1) For the unblooded: the open world of Skyrim can and will be daunting; you aren't given any clear-cut goals--or maybe you're given too many!  That deer in the headlights, \"what do I do now?\", sensation is perfectly normal.  Sit back and imagine yourself in an alternate reality; exactly, now you have it!  Figure out the controls and character management stuff (read the dang manual!) and the rest is completely up to your imagination!  Save your game often (every time you do something, basically) and experiment with anything you can think of; in no time flat, you'll realize this game is amazing.(2) For the grognards: assuming you've played Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3, then Skyrim will feel comfy.  It feels bigger and more inspiring thanks to the soaring mountains and the astounding soundtrack.  The action is fantastic and the new addition of trigger dual-wielding is a lot of fun--experiment with all the combinations (like smacking a foe with fire & ice spells simultaneously).Bethesda really simplified character creation and levelling, but they added in a robust Perk tree for every skill that presents a bewildering array of choices; I mean bewildering in that it's agonizing to choose which one to choose!  The Perks actually have a dramatic impact on the game though, so whatever direction you go is bound to be exciting.The interface is a lot cleaner and easier to access than any game before, including Fallout.  I'd say Skyrim is closer to Fallout in terms of how it feels when you're playing, but the world feels unique and interesting like it was in Morrowind; the best of both worlds, baby.  Dragons are fantasy at its best, and they feel appropriately tough.  The best encounters come when the dragon roars and swoops overhead, building up that anticipation; there are different types of them, so be wary if you beat one down easily because the next one might not be so cake.(3) General thoughts: I haven't had the game crash, not even once.  The load times off the HDD are less than 30 seconds and much shorter for small transitions like shops.  There are definitely some graphic hiccups and texture issues, but it's not constant nor bad enough to break the spell of immersion.  There is so much to do in this game that you could easily stay in one province of Skyrim and max out your level.Be careful with the difficulty setting, as some enemies are nearly indestructable on anything but normal, whereas the toughest enemies are sometimes far too easy when the difficulty is lowered.  You'll notice classic Elder Scroll follies, like a bandit kingpin beating you down faster than a pair of angry dragons--but that's present in almost every game that tries to keep it challenging.  It's better than Oblivion and much more like Fallout 3.The best character and most amazing thing about Skyrim is the world itself.  I've spent time simply gazing at the aurora lights or galactic clouds visible in the night sky; I've stood atop a lonely mountain in a snowstorm and just listened to the noise; I've stalked massive elk through sun-dappled pine forests; I've floated on an iceberg in the Sea of Ghosts, watching veils of fog swallow the land; I've walked with herds of mammoths across the tundra; I've delved into forgotten, undead-haunted halls where the slightest noise sends chills up your spine.Enjoy, my friends.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

Start with a single character, then travel through the world, gathering a party of up to 10 different characters.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Great way to pass time","reviewText":"It's pretty easy to describe Dungeon Siege. It's essentially Diablo with less clicking, a party of up to 8 characters, and better graphics, which means (#1) it doesn't take much intelligence to play it, and (#2) you'll play it until you realize you're wasting away from forgetting to eat.The biggest difference, aside from the obvious graphical edge, is the fact that the world is unchanging and absolutely gigantic. There are more places to explore than there are in Baldur's Gate, and some of the dungeons are so huge it'll take you an hour to walk from one exit to the other- even if the monsters are all dead.As noted previously, the graphics are top-notch 3-d and the engine in general is very streamlined and intuitive. I have noticed a few bugs here and there, but the game itself is very stable and runs well. As in Diablo, there aren't any tricks or puzzles to work though. If you explore everything, you'll probably find everything- pretty straightforward. Some battles are quite tough, however, and take a bit of fancy maneuvering to get by.About the only big (non-bug) complaint I have is that the AI is pretty stupid. If you send out one character, all the enemies in a certain radius will attack that character and will not stop until they are incapacitated. This makes is possible to wipe out a massively superior horde of monsters by getting a bunch of archers or wizards and having one warrior lead the goons in circles around them. I really expected better from the likes of Chris Taylor.AI stupidity aside, Dungeon Siege is definitely worth the money and worthy of the hype. For those who are tired of Diablo 2 and don't feel like waiting another decade for Diablo 3, go get this game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2002"}

Its stylus-action-game gameplay is very, very solid, probably even better than the gameplay of Kirby's Canvas Curse.  But this game does so, SO very much less with the engine than the great game Canvas Curse does.Some people will find enough satisfaction from this game playing for high scores in each of the four modes.  As for me, I am only good enough at the game to complete one of the modes, and what I see just isn't enough to keep me playing to improve.  Four modes - that's what this game has.  The goal is slightly different in each one.  But each one has just two stages - Mario falling, and Yoshi carrying Mario.  And once you take a single hit from an enemy, it's game over and start from the beginning (or midpoint).If you want this kind of stylus gameplay guiding the hero and keeping him safe with the stylus, get Kirby: Canvas Curse for DS.

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"fen \"fenfool\"","summary":"Wireless done to perfection","reviewText":"I received a Wave Bird controller as a present recently, and am completely taken with it.  It is very similar to the standard GameCube controllers, with the addition of a small platform on the bottom & a battery pack for the two (included) AA batteries...none of which is really noticeable during gameplay.The control is precise...I have noticed no lag, nor has the control ever been interrupted due to it pointing the wrong direction or something coming between it and the system.  In fact, we tested it for range, and I was able to work the control from my back yard, with the door closed...a range of somewhere around 60-70 feet!!!  No, most people aren't going to be using it from this far away, but it is nice to know the radio signal is that strong.  You can rest assured that your signal won't be cut off at a crucial moment in your game.Being a user who frequently utilizes all four controller ports, this is wonderful.  We continually get cords tangled, or the dog runs by & knocks one out...with this controller, all there is is the controller itself and a small receiver that plugs into the Gamecube.  The receiver can be attuned to several different frequencies, so you can indeed use four of these at once without encountering interference.The Wave Bird controller is a fantastic value...after the recent price drop, I was pondering buying a couple more standard Nintendo controllers to replace the third party controllers I have, but not any more...it is completely worth the extra money to pick up one of these instead.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2002"}

Still for me the game was really short, I think it was because I just beat DKTF then put this game in and It was much easier in difficulty so I was able to breeze right through.Still a worthy buy for any Wii U owner.

The game had very fun gameplay, and it was pleasing the chop insignificant humans in two with my array of powers.I thought this game was quite humourous with the main character Sargent- James Heller, who has the same name as one of my best friends.i had never played the original prototype, so when i tried to get into the story, i just got lost even more. from what i remember, james heller gets infected with the Mercer Virus, which is from the original game, made by the first character, Alex Mercer. supposedly, he killed your wife and daughter, and you need to claim revenge on him. everything else gets very confusing.one thing that i enjoyed about this game, however, was the wide array of powers you got as James Heller. The powers you recieve come right when you need them, as i would start to become bored with one weapon.As a stereotypical 'M' game, this game is bloody. but it seems like to to bloody/gory. as Heller, you 'consume' people, and you can take their bodies, which i have to admit is pretty cool. but it seems in every cutscene or animation, there is a flurry of blood or gore, and Heller throws out a profanity. This was no big issue to me, as i expected this game to be pretty dirty.Unfortunatley, the game gets very repetative, and you cycle through doing about 4-5 different types of missions throughout the story. i like how you can go to free roam after a randommission and upgrade your power through blackwatch or something like that, but again, its repetative.here is one thing that started to really bug me throughout the game: the camera. The camera in Prototype 2 follows Heller wherever he goes, and is a good distance fromhim to see you surroundings. However, when it comes to the lock-on feature, it wants to target the first thing that is closest to you, and your character hinself is locked on, moving around it- so when i am trying to fight a boss and lock on to him, the camera sometimes locks on to a insignificant human, and Heller flies the other direction, reaching for him instead. i feel as if i dont have enough time to lock on to specific things, as 163 things are trying to kill me all at once.besides the camera and the overused gore/profanities, Prototype 2 is very fun to play just to hack enemies to pieces, and to upgrade your powers in order to be nearly invincible.As an additional comment, this game, like all games, warns you about seizures and how people can get them because of flashy effects and ect. Well, this game is not kidding when they warn you- almost every cutscene has odd bright colors and is very strobe-like, and sometimes made my eyes twitch, so its good to read the warnings about taking breaks, and ect, lol.It was a great game to play, short, but didnt matter. i had a lot of fun. just watch out for trippy lighting effects and such.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2012"}

The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Brian Forrester \"Brian Forrester, Noblesville IN\"","summary":"Another great R&C addition","reviewText":"I've loved all three of the games in the Ratchet and Clank series, this one no less.  I'm not an active Online gamer, epecially where Shooter games are concerned, so that wasn't a big deal.  Unfortunately, it seems that the Online mode caused the One-player mode to come up a little short in this installment.  There just seem to be fewer levels.  That could only be a perception, however.  As I've not counted the number of levels/missions, I can't back that up with statistics.  It just seems that I flew through the main story more quickly than I did the first two (or at least the second, Going Commando).Pros:1. New weapons (the Rift Inducer is really cool), with more levels of upgrades than before.2. Freebies from saved games of R&C; 1&23. Online capable4. New mini-games5.

Nasar","summary":"Good ideas but lacking quality","reviewText":"I will be honest, the only reason I gave this a chance is because how few titles of this genre are available on the PS4 right now . The game is fun IF you are patient and willing to overlook many really bad design choices. My biggest complaint with the gameplay is that it feels too repetitive and unfair..you don't have that many skills to use or ways to kill your enemies especially at the beginning and you end up repeating the same noob-ish strategy/exploits over and over ...this especially true against boss battles. The game also loves to overwhelm you with multiple enemies ..long ranged enemies like archers and mages and then some incoming melee enemies ..while you do have a companions to help you, it still feel unfair because of how limited your options are. What I do like about the game? well I am a sucker for dark-fantasy settings, like dark souls or dragon's dogma or game of thrones sort of thing and this game does have that going for it. The story isn't much ..humanity on the verge of extinction, with only few mercenaries standing between the horde of demonic army and us. The visuals are solid, some pretty cel-shading but the character models and animation are poor. Voice acting was clearly not a priority for the developers, let's just say it's bad.Overall I can not recommend this game, the developers were obviously inspired by games like Dark Souls and Dragon Age however the game is a far cry from the aforementioned titles in term of quality. This isn't surprising either, if you look at the history of this studio they have released two poor games prior to this one, \"Of Orcs and Men\" , and \"Mars: Log Wars\", you would think they have gotten better by now but that is not the case. This game feels like it was rushed to the market to capitalize on the fact that few games are out right now and it is getting much more spotlight that it would have done if there was any competition.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Satisfied with purchase","reviewText":"When I picked this up, I wanted to make sure I gave it a chance before I wrote a review.  Too often, people pick up a game (especially one as hyped as this) and render a verdict after five minutes of playing. I will admit, Watch Dogs didn't initially win me over.  First, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics.  Now, don't get me wrong, the graphics aren't bad, but after being spoiled by Infamous Second Son, the next-gen graphics bar has been set pretty high.  I realize a cross platform game won't be as optimized as an exclusive, so I won't judge Watch Dogs too harshly on that alone.  Besides, the open Chicago world environment in Watch Dogs is still amazing, just not better than Seattle in ISS.  It's a little drab and not as lush and colorful as Seattle, but it's my understanding that this was intentional.  My next complaint is the driving.  Yes, it's true, the vehicle control is horrible. Cars handle about as clumsy as a supermarket shopping cart.  Motorcycles handle much better but obviously can't take as much damage.  Despite the horrible handling, I managed to get just good enough at driving.  However, that horrible handling still rears its ugly head from time to time, usually when you're involved in a high-speed pursuit and trying to multitask by hacking gates, poles, and traffic signals while driving.As for the rest of gameplay, the story gets started relatively fast.  The initial plot development happens pretty fast without an overly lengthy cut scene.  The hacking was a little confusing at first as you'll initially feel a little information overload when scanning for nearby devices to hack.  I guess I know how General Zod and Superman felt prior to training their senses in Man of Steel.  Eventually, I got the knack for scanning and found it very effective for finding nearby assets.  The other controls: running, shooting, crouching and looking around, are the usual fare if you've ever played an open world game.  I have no complaints with controls other than driving. The tutorial system is pretty straightforward and sticks around long enough for you to get accustomed to the controls. Most menus are easily accessed with one button and sub-menus are navigated with the analog sticks.  In addition to helping you defeat or escape foes, hacking is also quite comical at times as you see the deepest secrets of everyone around you revealed.  Some of the secrets are a little dark but that just adds to the realism.As far as the missions, I don't find them boring or repetitive at all.  I actually enjoy side missions.  For $60, I don't want to hard charge through a game and complete it in a few days.  I want as much interaction as possible.  I'm the type who prefers to complete all the side-missions before clearing a primary mission. In that regard, Watch Dogs satisfies my thirst to explore and find different things to do before continuing along the primary arc.  There is more than enough to keep you busy for a while if you like exploring.I had a tough decision.  It came down to buying this or Wolfenstein.  Ultimately, I decided on Watch Dogs after reading several reviews posted by people who completed Wolfenstein fairly quickly.  The general consensus was that it was an awesome game, just short.  That made the decision of deciding which game to buy now and which one to wait for a price drop a much easier one for me.  I really like Watch Dogs.  While I don't feel it quite lives up to the massive hype, and anything seldom does, it is very fun and, most importantly, I want to keep playing whenever I can.  For me, that is the true value of a game.  For instance, I bought Killzone two months ago, played a few hours the first week or so and had no urge to return.  I just didn't find the campaign very interesting or engaging enough. Multiplayer was much better but I prefer solo campaigns.  The solo campaign of Watch Dogs is very satisfying so far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

The single player is mediocre as there isn't much of a story, the computer is unrelenting and the payoff is substandard. The online mode seems to pair me up with people that have made it their mission in life to be the gods of this game, so that was out after a short while, but playing with friends is a ton of fun.Having a few people over to play a tournament or just goof around is what this game is all about. It reminds me of when I was teenager, going to the Jersey Shore with friends and wasting all our money in the arcade playing each other at whatever game seemed coolest. Those days are (unfortunately) long gone but this game is a good reminder of that.If it didn't have that aspect I would have rated the game lower since it's literally just a straight fighting game that plays on people's nostalgia and love of brands. The battles are fast paced but I just sort of mash the buttons and hope for the best, which has been my go-to strategy for fighting games for the whole life. Easy in the arcade, not so easy with all of the xbox buttons.Even so, the graphics detail is amazing, the characters have a very unique look to them, like moving comic book characters.

You have a time limit to find the water chip, but when that task is done, the game is not. There is much to do in the Fallout world where you will find friends to help you out and will have many weapons at your disposal. Fallout2 take place 80 years after the first. You are the Chosen one. A descendent of the original character from the first game, you are sent on a mission to find the Garden of Eden Creation Kit which will restore the land in your village. This is a very large game. More area to cover, more missions to accomplish, more weapons, and more enemies to thrash. The gameplay and graphics are slightly better than the first, but this is also a very enjoyable game. Both games are turn based when fighting and you can create your own character.

I loved the first part, so I couldn't believe that I'd love the second part more than the first! I love horror games and scaring myself silly, and nowadays survival horror games are few and far between. So, this game is absolutely amazing! It's a combination of survival horror and action, similar to Resident Evil 4. I wish there were more games like this.I found Dead Space 2 less scary than the first part, but it's atmospheric nonetheless. In Dead Space 1, Issac had to roam through tight, dark corridors, so the scare factor was RELENTLESS. Dead Space 2 is still very scary, but it's slightly more open spaced than its predecessor. The new monsters such as \"The Sprawl.\" A pack of screaming monsters which resemble children terrified me! Once they get ahold of you, it's hard to free yourself.In Dead Space 2, the graphics are more polished and outstanding! Unlike the first part, Issac can now speak. The voice acting was excellent. I wasn't a fan of the holographic map in Dead Space 1, so I was delighted to find out that it was replaced. Instead of consulting the map for the Bench, Store, Save Stations, you can find out by pressing R3. You get different colored lights for each one. I found this feature very convenient.Another difference was that you can now re-fill your health bar by pressing the O button. In Dead Space 1, while I was in the middle of battling (and whimpering LOL) the army of Necromorphs, I had to open my inventory in order to re-fill my depleted health. So in those precious seconds, Issac usually got his behind mauled. So I'm thankful that the producers fine-tuned this feature.Additionally, the producers have fine-tuned the zero gravity area by enabling Issac to fly instead of jumping to other platforms (like in Dead Space 1). So getting to other platforms is swifter and fun!I also noticed that the Stasis module duration doesn't last long in Dead Space 2 as opposed to 1. It could be my imagination, but you could solve it by upgrading your stasis at the Bench.Another nice feature is that the game provides you with claws (from the dead Necromorphs) and sharp-looking objects that resemble a spear in order to attack the enemies. It's a great way to save ammunition. However, I'm what you can call trigger-happy so despite my efforts, I end up shooting blindly (especially when I'm flustered and petrified :p).Last but not least, the annoying asteroid-shooting mini game is gone in Dead Space 2! I can't tell you how many times I've died during that horrible mini-game (which just increased my frustration). I'm sure I'm not the only one who's relieved to know it wasn't featured again in this game.The game starts with Issac running away from a mob of Necromorphs while strapped in a strait jacket. Swell, right? When I was running away with my heart in my throat, I just knew that this was the start of an impending doom for poor little me. The producers have outdone themselves with this game. It deserves to be owned by every gamer who loves survival horror or just to play a fantastic game. Everything ranging from the graphics to the controls is simply splendid. It goes without saying that I highly recommend this game. I advise you to play Dead Space 1 first in order to understand and follow the story. I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I did!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}

But so what? Many development houses learn from their peers and try to improve on its awesomeness - or just try to match it. If comparisons to GTA must be made, aside from stock GTA gameplay elements, it's probably most akin to GTA San Andreas. Specifically the gang turf block wars section where you fight gangs on the street or complete missions to convert blocks of the city to your colors.Saints Row is all about respect. You perform minor missions (called activities) such as escorting hookers or creating carnage on a big scale and this gives you respect - get enough respect and a main mission will open up. Complete a main mission and the block is yours - earning you cash every week. The storyline is usual fodder for these sorts of games - rival gangs are in your turf and you have to defeat them - by destroying their music HQ, stealing their drugs etc.In graphics are considerably improved over the GTA franchise. Stunning view distances, burning vehicles create haze, water looks incredible, and the architecture is almost on par with PGR3 in places. The cut scenes especially show the engine off - with depth of field blurring and nice sfx. Sonically things are equally good - no complaints.So I'm about 9% in (around 7 hours) and loving it. I like to drive around and check out the scenery - do what I want when I want and Saints Row let's me. (Sadly I keep driving around looking for unique jumps!). So yes - it's a GTA type game. It's great fun and looks 1,000 times better than its inspiration.Had rockstar released a GTA game for the 360 I would probably not rate this game as high - but for now it's well worth your money and should tide you over until GTA4 comes out.

{"product_name":"B002I0K780","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A legitimately fun platformer for all ages.","reviewText":"I didn't like the first LittleBigPlanet. Messed up physics, Sackboy's jump being floaty, and other seemingly small things kept me from enjoying it, though it definitely had tons of replay thanks to a great online community. So I wasn't too thrilled to try LBP2 here, but my god did they pull out all the stops with this game. Nearly every problem I had with the first is gone. Every single level was fun. Going online and playing levels created by others was even smoother than before. The little additions to gameplay like racing and shooting didn't feel tacked-on and actually made things better and more diverse. This could very well be the best platformer I've played in the last 5 years. Simply put, anyone who wants a fun game needs to run out and at the very least rent LBP2 right now. This is one of the few games out right now where I wouldn't feel ripped off if I paid full price for it...and I'm the kind of person who typically waits 3-4 months after a game comes out and drops in price before buying.LBP2 has a bit of a plot that's worth mentioning. It's not that original, but it's a cute little plot. A huge inter-dimensional vacuum cleaner monster, the Negativitron, starts sucking up everything in its sights, including little Sackboy. He's rescued by Larry Da Vinci who's part of a group known simply as The Alliance. It's The Alliance's job to defeat the Negativitron before it destroys Craftworld.Just like the first game, you play as Sackboy going through each level by running, jumping, putting stickers on things, pulling levers and riding strange creatures. But unlike the first game, where levels were usually designed the same with 'move this over here to open this door', there's a lot more action. There were very few moments where I'd stop moving because the design of the game is at a much faster pace this time around. Sackboy still has that floaty jump of his, but it doesn't matter since a lot of the times you'll be relying on tools to make big jumps or to reach an area. Now Sackboy can use a grappling hook, gloves that let him pick up and throw blocks (and Sackbots), and a water cannon that puts out fires and makes plants grow, which create bridges and pathways for him to walk on. Where a lot of games would have these scattered out in the levels, having them be a novelty more than anything, LBP2 has one of these tools in the majority of the levels, and they're all fun to use. I especially liked the water cannon since it could dispose of enemies that were made of fire, and could put out burning platforms...but I'd had to be quick since fire from a platform next to the one I'd be standing on would spread back to mine. Little things like that added to the fun for me, and I never once got frustrated with any of these gameplay elements. But one of the game defining moments for me was riding atop a camel with a machine gun in its mouth, blasting everything in sight as The Alliance was under attack.The levels themselves are pretty creative, though I do like some of the worlds in the first game more (like the African and Mexican worlds). You can still earn tons of prizes like costumes and stickers in each level, and if you have a saved file from the first LBP, that data carries over here, so you could have TONS of costumes to make a very unique Sackboy by the time you finish this game. One of my favorite new costumes is a disco skin, which constantly changes Sackboy's color. Each world has a big boss at the end, but they're not that difficult. Truth be told, most younger kids (around 10 years or younger) shouldn't have any trouble with anything here except possibly the last boss' final phase where patience is a virtue. As for the story, you can skip every cutscene before and after the levels. Like I said above, it's cute, but for people like me who just want to get on with the game and play it, it's nice that we have the option to skip things. And regarding the online gameplay and making your own levels...if you thought the first game had a lot of features, you haven't seen anything. Now you can incorporate the racing and shooting elements from the story mode into your own custom levels, adding another layer of fun to things. Overhead shooter, side scrolling shooter...do what you want. And just as before, the Playstation camera can be used with the level creator, allowing you to add even more personal touches. Finally, yes, there are now robots, called Sackbots, that can be used to open doors, earn more prizes depending on how many survive, and can defeat specific enemies with their lasers. You can put them in custom levels, and will probably want to after seeing these little guys save you a couple of times towards the end. Really, seeing these noble little guys blasting the heck out of giant creatures as a team was one of the cooler things I'd seen in a game this console generation.The graphics have vastly improved, and everything looks beautiful. That was actually the first thing I noticed when I started playing- how much better the levels and effects look, especially particle effects. I actually never experienced any slowdown in the story mode, but some online levels had such an ungodly amount of stuff going on that I did notice a tiny bit of slowdown, but not much. The game also features a nice soundtrack, and you gotta love the instrumental version of Sleepy Head (stay away from the version with vocals). All the voice acting is great, and is one of the reasons I didn't skip most of the cut scenes the first time I played story levels. Solid production values all around.At first, I was going to give LBP2 4 stars...but looking back, I enjoyed this game so much that it wouldn't be right. Whereas I loved Donkey Kong Country Returns, I think I like LittleBigPlanet 2 more. I breezed through the main game in about 5 hours, but went back for the prize bubbles, played with friends online, tried my hand at making a level, and replayed some of the shooter and racing levels a bunch of times because they were that fun. Look, unless a game's really fun or special, I rarely go back and replay it. Considering how much I didn't like the first LBP, I'm astonished that I loved this one so much...and that I've put in so much time already. LittleBigPlanet 2 is one of the ps3's best titles by far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"kurlebj \"kurlebj\"","summary":"Blood Omen 2 Arrives on PS2 and Delivers Little","reviewText":"I was very excited to get BO2 as I have been playing the series since the beginning. And when I played Soul Reaver 2 for PS2 I was even moe excited for BO2 since I loved SR2. But I picked it up the other day and was rather disappointed. First off, let me say that I didn't hate the game. It's a decent game and true to the storyline. However, it looks like this game was thrown together in a big rush. There are many problems within this game. First and Foremost I thought the graphics were rather sub-par when considering the PS2's capabilities. The characters could have been much more detailed and the lands are rather bland and boring. Nothing too incredible in this department. Also, there are some quite annoying frame slow downs all through out the game. Just out of nowhere the FPS will just slow down rapidly for a few seconds and then speed back up again. It isn't the worst thing that could happen but is annoying. Also, I thought the gameplay was a little rough. Could have been smoother and more fluid.Overall, not a terrible game but could have been a lot better. For those of you who are Legacy of Kain veterans, I would say, play it for the storyline but for those who are new to the series, I would stay away as there are much better games of this type you could be playing. Either way, I recommend renting it before buying it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2002"}

As someone who put over 300 hours combined (according to Steam) on the previous Arkham games, I have been looking forward to this game all year.  I wasn't expecting miracles out of it, but Arkham City is one of my favorite games of all time, so if it had any of that magic, I was on board.  The good news is - the game, the story, the production value - all fantastic.  The bad news is that the PC version of this game is so riddled with bugs, glitches, and game-stopping nonsense that you may not be able to even progress through the story.I have personally encountered at least two dozen serious bugs and have had to restart the game several times due to game-stoppers - bugs which halt your progress entirely.  To be fair, the devs have released a couple of patches intending to fix the issues, but the patches have been bringing in much more serious bugs than those they fix.  Just yesterday, a patch was released that broke THE ENDING OF THE GAME.  I'm sure that will be fixed before long, but this game has been a non-stop hassle for over a week since release.  It's so plainly obvious that the game wasn't finished yet, but shipped anyway to meet the deadline.Despite all this, there is a great game beneath the hassle, and once they fix the problems it will be well worth playing, but I can't recommend it now.  Maybe rent it for one of the consoles and wait for a deep discount on the PC version.  It will probably be very cheap during the Christmas sales.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Controls like butter, but it isnt perfect","reviewText":"The original Red Steel, released back during the Wii launch of November 06, was a major disappointment to most. It tanked critically, yet managed to be a commercial success. The game promised a fast and precise controlled game where a mix of swordplay and fire fights shower the game. Unfortunately, a rushed release and lack of knowledge about Nintendo's new device made Red Steel (1), a poor game. After nearly 4 years, Ubisoft has finally managed to fulfill on Red Steel's promises, the sequel is a reboot to the original, with ties only in name and general concept. Red Steel 2, is very much an improved game, it controls like butter, yet has several faults that may well turn down this as a purchase for some.RS2 is the second game to be released for use EXCLUSIVLY with the WiiMotion Plus device. This little add on grants players unprecedented precision and accuracy, and as Wii Sports Resort proves, it works very well. Your motions are now registered 98% of the time; your left motion is always read as left, your up as up, and these actions are never confused. Subtle twists of the wrists are read with speed. Even the IR based shooting parts of the game benefit from WiiMotion Plus, as the cursor is smoothened, it never flickers or \"jumps\" positions, and you continue to control it even after having pointed off-screen. RS2 is the best controlled first person game on Wii, and arguably on any home console. It runs at 60fps and ultimately performs better than Call of Duty Wii, The Conduit, or even Medal of Honor. The WiiMotion Plus does require the occasional recalibration, but this issue is minor and is hardly as big a deal as some people are making it.Taking advantage of this new found precision, RS2 created a very fun combat system. Enemies are locked on (either automatically as you approach, or manually), and your sword swipes have a direct result on the enemy. This is one game were you must perform your motion as described in game; a wimpy swing or \"waggle\" will hardly damage anything, but a shoulder to shoulder swing will. Sword mode and gun mode are swapped with a single button, and is fast and works well. Of course the game plays its best when in sword mode, but certain finishers and game elements require and advocate the use of fire arms. Adding to this all are special moves that are slowly learned throughout the game. These moves act as combos, were chaining together simply motions at the right time activate major damage. One such move can lift an enemy into the air (where you can jump up and continue fighting) while another creates a big earthquake.Players are propelled to continue playing because of the fun factor as well as the well designed upgrading system. In RS2, money found in game (by braking just about everything and slaughtering enemies) can be spent on upgrades to firearms, your blade, your armor, and special abilities. There are four long range weapons to choose from, although not all are available from the beginning of the game. Each weapon can be upgraded to an insane level, things like ammo capacity, reload speed, accuracy, and even types of ammo. Everything else is upgraded in a similar manner.Despite the amazingly well done controls, RS2 has a nonsense and boring storyline. Old-school games won't mind, but some newer gamers will definitely find it odd to play a 10 hour game with what is basically no plot or ambitions. The \"shell\" of a story that was found in the original is nowhere to be found. Again, is game is more a spiritual successor than a direct sequel. Voice acting is painfully bad. It's not cheesy, just poorly acted and written.Red Steel 2 is one of the best looking Wii games yet. The game runs a an amazingly fluid 60fps all the while maintaining increadibly detailed environments and enemies. The graphics are easily one of the games highlights, and thats a rarity among Wii games. High resolution textures and detailed character models make RS2 look like it has no buisness being on Wii, and thast a good thing.With little variety in locations, enemies, or game modes, RS2 can get old real fast. Repetition easily sets in. After beating the main story mode, there is little to do. A bare bones challenge mode consists of cut sequences from the story mode. There is no multiplayer to speak off, be it local or online. This are flaws that should simply not exist in a full priced game, and, despite its amazing combat and controls, it's hard to recommend RS2 at full price. The game shouldn't be missed though, as it truly does represent the next evolution in Wii controls. It fulfills the promises of smooth and perfect sword and gun controls some may have thought weren't possible on Wii. At a discounted price, Red Steel 2 is a game that everyone should own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

Also, they are fast. The first time I entered a battle with my companion, it was over before I could pull out my machete, which I don't mind. Also, you can rob graves and weigh breaks down into .01, so you do have to be more thoughtful. Hardcore mode is hardcore. I wish you luck.Shooting: Aside from the VATS system (which is like a turn based form of attack), using the guns in this game just are not fun. Aiming is flaccid and most of the time you cant tell where your bullets went. I was hoping to interact in the environment with a more realistic feel, similar to Modern Warfare 2 only I can pick up plates and sell Scorpion Glands.Hacking: Has not changed...at all...the only difference is that now you have a \"survival\" skill that makes distributing points more competitive, problem is: survival is not worth the points early one (at least for me) and I am now at a point where I doubt I will need it.Characters: Much more diverse than Fallout 3. Many different ways to interact. Can have up to two companions (one human/robot and one dog/animal).Plot: So far, nothing has come close to repeating from Fallout 3, even in my side missions.Graphics: Same bleak Tan, brown, black and steel setting as before. Makes me look forward to the forests and castles of Fable 3.Maturity: More profane than before, at least as far as I have noticed.Disappointments: Chose a couple of Perk upgrades that have been a big let down, which is a big let down because you only select a perk every other level. On a separate note, the game should have been titled \"Fallout: Glitch City\" the problems it has are almost embarrassing. I wonder if they even played it, still it is nothing that will disrupt gameplay. You have to wait a while before you get to new vegas, which is probably a good thing. Gives you time to accumulate money and a caravan deck to play with.If you want a game that is more than gunning and running, I recommend this one, but you will be spending ten-thirty minutes trying to locate a box of sugarbombs or 10 minutes searching a house to not find the gun you were hoping for. Save money on the Game guide and use the internet. There are some great sites for this game that explain everything.Wish my character had a horse/car/motorcycle, just to cut down on the monotonous walking I have to do. Also wish they had improved maps making exiting big buildings easier.Not as scary or visually stunning as Bioshock or engaging as Modern Warfare or Arkham Asylum, but I will keep walking around the desert until I find a reason to stop and I will take this game over Red Dead Redemption ANY DAY!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2010"}

And basically got to go along for a ride. There really is no wandering about in the game. Your path is pretty set in stone. It's all very straight track.The story is pretty good, the voice acting is well, and the graphics, well there good, but not great. You'll find moments, such as when you cross the bridge and look back, where the team was a bit cheap, or maybe ran out of time. The background scene is all pixilated! But for the most part, the world is really really well done. You really get caught up in things.The game has multiple humorous moments where you'll find yourself laughing out loud, or huffing in frustration.The controls for the game, handle better than I thought they were going to handle. Pretty tight, simple straight forward.I have advice for anyone starting out on this game. Make sure you upgrade your ammo capacity first! Because the ammo for the staff is .. sparse. I mean, you'll run into a lot, and then it just thins out completely almost leaving you hanging. So upgrade that first and use it sparingly.One thing that bugged me, was the fact of all these mechs in the game, there didn't seem to be any people at all to interact with, to show that the world was alive, even though in ruins... I mean this is somewhat explained at the end... but it was like, they caught everyone? and the story, while simple. At the end it gets really really messed up, well that's my opinion. It'll probably throw you for a loop and leave you asking questions about whats going on..Also, as much exploring as you do... everything is over so fast.. the game really has a lot of content, but it just, its over. It seems like there should have been so much more story and journey. Also the game plays with itself a bit. Which will leave you very frustrated. You'll know what I mean when you get to a couple chapters toward the end.Like I said, buy this game if your just wanting to play a simple adventure game with lovable characters, and a very interesting world. (Well except for the lady at the beginning, if your like me, you'll hate her guts.. at least at first)Bottom line, I bought this game on whim, end up thoroughly enjoy it and, It's not perfect, but I don't regret spending the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"E.S.","summary":"Better the first time around...","reviewText":"First and foremost, I would like to say that the first Bioshock completely blew my mind.  Whether it was the plasmids, the engaging storyline, or the sick graphics.  Having said that, you get basically a new dose of \"Adam\" even though you're thoroughly spent.  What made the first Bioshock utterly amazing was the fact it was essentially a unique game playing experience that no other game could offer.  Wielding guns and plasmids made for a great time killing \"Adam\"-addicts and Big Brothers, etc. Going into the unknown of Rapture itself was definitely an experience because you as the player did not know what the city was capable or nor what was living in it.  The second time around, I kinda yawned through parts of it as there really wasn't too much that was new this time as you're basically the hero once again in the same city, doing the same thing (using guns and plasmids to kill the baddies), and either rescuing or harvesting Little Sisters.  If you're expecting a completely new game where it's a new city and a ton of new features that the first game didn't have, you'll be sorely disappointed.  But if you can honestly call yourself a huge fan of the first and don't mind getting more of the same, this game is definitely for you.  Personally, I felt the majority of this game was as if I bought NCAA Football 10 after being in love with NCAA Football 09 or any other yearly update of a sports game.  Don't get me wrong, the Bioshock series is better than 90% of games out there, but there was too much that was rehashed for me to really consider this a GOTY or anything in the upper echelon of games.  The fascination and curiosity I had throughout playing the first game was not present as I knew what to expect (for the most part) and how to work my way through the game.  I'm not interested in playing the multiplayer Bioshock 2 as I prefer COD: MW2 like most people, so if anybody is in love with what 2K is doing with their online gameplay then have at it.  I realize this is an early review and I haven't played every crevice of game thus far, but remember it's my own opinion, so take it as you want.  This would be a welcomed addition to most game collections, but to the younger generation who do not have a steady income, I would suggest renting the game and moving on to something new afterwards.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

Needlessly to say, the game is fun and addictive (but still very creepy). It has a better shooter action and more challenging opponents than the original. If you liked Bioshock 1, you will not be disappointed. Although the play action of this game surpasses the Bioshock 1, the storyline wasn't as enthralling. And that's too bad since lack of captivating story makes this game just an another great shooter game. The philosophies of the characters, however, are deeper. This game makes you think of your own consciousness and what it means to be alive and choose.  Just like the original, you must make several moral decision that determines the outcome of the game.Here are the significant differences between Bioshock 1 and 2:1)You get to use both plasmids and weapons at the same time (not quite simultaneously)2)The weapons are far more powerful than in Bioshock 1.3)You are not as invincible as Big Daddy as you were in Bioshock 1.4)You only get to store maximum of 6 First Aids and Eve Hypos.5)The opponents are far tougher and move much quicker.6)There are more twists but they are more obvious than in Bioshock 1.7)There are fewer puzzles than in Bioshock 1Overall, I was entertained. But I can't say I was as emotionally into this game as I was in the first one, and that emotional content and captivation made the first Bioshock one of the greatest games of all time.

InHeavy Raineach player discovers their own answer to this question as they experience a gripping psychological thriller filled with innumerable twists and turns, where choices and actions can and do result in dramatic consequences. Spanning four days of mystery and suspense, the hunt is on for a murderer known only as the Origami Killer - named after his macabre calling card of leaving behind folded paper shapes at crime scenes. Even more chilling is the fiend's well established pattern of killing his victims four days after abducting them. The public is gripped with fear as the police seem powerless to stop the carnage, and another potential victim &#151; Shaun Mars &#151; has gone missing. Now four characters, each following their own leads and with their own motives, must take part in a desperate attempt to prevent the killer from taking yet another life.","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"How far would you go to save someone you love?","reviewText":"French developer Quantic Dream, the mind behind the unique and innovative Indigo Prophecy, seems to have finally nail down its formula with Heavy Rain, the highly anticipated \"interactive drama\", which manages to mesh powerful story-telling and atmosphere with engrossing and immersive gameplay.Heavy Rain's narrative focuses on four protagonists separate protagonists - architect Ethan Mars, journalist Madison Paige, private detective Scott Shelby, and FBI agent Norman Jayden - whose lives interweave with one another. Without giving too much away, the game's unifying \"antagonist\" is a serial killer given the moniker \"Origami Killer\" thanks to the small origami art found atop all of the victims, who police have been unable to locate while the death count increases.Staying true to the \"interactive drama\" genre, Heavy Rain is entirely narrative-driven, as the characters wrestle with internal and external conflict, yet transcends its own newly created genre thanks to an accessibility that grants it wider appeal than Quantic Dream's last outing. It's also an unabashedly dark, mature game, with hints of the film noir genre, as it focuses on its overwhelmingly grounded characters thrust into extraordinary, exigent circumstances, also flirting heavily with the question of the tagline, \"How far would you go to save someone you love?\" It probes the depths of human nature, among other things, far more than almost all games before it.In terms of actual gameplay, Heavy Rain employs an untraditional control scheme, mostly through commands mandated by certain button presses, that strives to add to the immersion by making movements and actions feel precise and deliberate. General maneuvering will likely be hit or miss among players - I found it to be particularly intuitive, though sharp changes in direction while walking rarely offered me some trouble, likely because I didn't feel the need to stop before changing directions. More action-oriented scenes - and the game is filled to the brim with them, each more intense than the last - are handled with more familiar series of button presses that resemble quick-time-events seen in other titles, though they generally keep in line with the intuitiveness of the control scheme and offer a lot of depth.One other notable aspect to the gameplay is its malleable nature. While narrative driven, Heavy Rain isn't driven by a single narrative, meaning the players' actions have direct implications to the story, and to such an extreme degree that the main protagonists can actually die at various points within the confines of the story. This sense of permanence lends itself greatly to Heavy Rain's gripping nature, while the malleability of the story results in seven different possible outcomes (as well as replayability for those who would like to see all of the different choices afforded to the player and the outcomes they yield).The script is intelligently penned, in terms of both dialogue and plot vehicles. The characters are incredibly believable and multidimensional, which allows you to develop a deep connection with them (Ethan, in particular) and the characters themselves fully develop as the game progresses. The main storyline itself is also particularly clever and bound to leave most people guessing until the end and thoroughly engrossed.The script is also rife with thrilling, intense moments, which juxtapose beautifully with the theme of subtlety and nuance prevalent throughout the experience. In fact, Heavy Rain features some of the most intense scenes video games have ever seen, due in great part to the connection to characters that the strong storytelling and atmosphere breed. Many people might have been put off by fears of \"slow\" gameplay that's been going around, but the game veraciously and unapologetically dispels that notion; the parts that are \"slow\" cleverly presented, expertly crafted scenes that draw you further into the world, get you further invested in the characters and all so the game can forcibly shake you down to your very core with powerful, captivating moments.One reason behind the game's success with creating compelling characters, outside of the writing, is the technology. The game as a whole, is a graphical powerhouse; the graphics are unbelievable, and certainly the most realistic to date. The extensive motion capture and attention to detail, augmented by the powerful hardware of the PS3, lend themselves to the most believable, personable facial animation the gaming industry has ever seen, which in turn grants a higher level of connection to the characters, who feel incredibly real. The most subtle nuances - muscle twitches in the face - or blemishes on a character's skin add one more layer to the already multilayered characters, as well as unprecedented believability.Character models have been meticulously crafted to reflect genuineness in the characters, just as the mostly-urban environments have been to reflect an authenticity of the game world. The atmosphere is chilling when it needs to be, while maintaining sincerity consistently. The drama works thanks to subtlety and attention to detail - the most miniscule object haphazardly laying about in a room, for example, gives the room an air of authenticity, as if someone is truly living there. Equally considered is the sound work, which seamlessly blends with scenes, completely amplifying the emotional resonance; the musical score is poignant and artfully composed, while sound effects help further immersion into the setting.The voice acting, however, isn't without its flaws. While the majority of it ranges from good to top-notch there are a few poor accents in the game, which are simply jarring because of how noticeable they can be when juxtaposed with setting (which isn't France, mind you) and other characters; it really leads to wonder as to why they didn't consider hiring any North American voice talent - perhaps even approaching some notable actors - considering the focus on narrative.There also occasional subtle issues with animation (such as an item not entirely being in a character's grip) which, despite their brevity, are noticeable. Of course, this is also a testament to the game's technological prowess overall, because the things that do stand out as flaws are so unbelievably inconsequential that they'd hardly be noticed in just about any other game.The list of complaints about Heavy Rain are slim, but it remains true that it may not be a game for everyone. That being said, there isn't a gamer out there that shouldn't at least give the game a chance - a chance to be captivated, enveloped, and engrossed. It's somewhat hard to do the title full justice without giving away any of the scenes in the game in an exciting manner that hooks you in, but they're better left - each and every one - to experience, not know beforehand, even if it's something exponentially small.All that needs to be said is that Heavy Rain is an incredibly polished, unique title with its emphasis on delivering a mature, compelling story - and, that the game succeeds in all aspects, thanks to incredibly realistic technology, a stirring musical score, excellent writing, intuitive gameplay, and, perhaps most of all, absolutely brilliant directing by David Cage who manipulates scenes - from camera angles to lighting to character performance - with a rarely seen mastery. Heavy Rain is an experience that will stay with you long after you finish its story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Rainbow Six delivers another stellar title","reviewText":"I really, really like this game. The single player campaign is a blast and the enemy A.I. makes it a worthy challenge for even the most seasoned gamers. The multiplayer, of course, is probably some of the best online gaming that I have ever experienced with great co-op and adversarial matching. Graphics are top notch plus the overall sound design is just about perfect.I wouldn't say that this game is for everyone, as it is a little slower paced and is by no means a run and gun shooter. This is definitely a one shot, one kill type of game and emphasizes the importance of staying under cover. Still, the sheer amount of insanity that happens during a close quarters fire fight makes this game an experience worth checking out. Just the other day while playing an online co-op match with three others, I made the mistake of rappelling past a building window three stories up without checking it first. To make a long story short, after the match, one of the other guys told me that he looked up just in time to see the window explode outward and my body fly back and down to the street below from several well placed shotgun blasts.Character creation reaches a new level also with the ability to put your own face on your character using the Xbox Live Vision camera. It's implemented really well and you'll be surprised to see just how good it looks after you complete the short process. A big plus!All in all, I am strongly recommending this game. It's a lot of fun, there's a huge community online playing as we speak and there's hardly anything wrong with it to speak of. If you liked Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter, chances are you'll love this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Rainbow Vegas Rocks!","reviewText":"Rainbow Six Vegas is an incredible game. The graphics,the gameplay is amazing. You start off solo in Mexico,yes Mexico, before you'll eventually get to Vegas ,but not to worry mexico looks just as detailed as Vegas and Mexico is only 4 of the 21 total maps in the story mode.The enemies,at times,will flank you and your squad very very agressivly and are pretty good shots.You'll hear your squadmates say\"there flanking us\".Likewise your squad A.I. responds very well to your orders and will go just about anywhere you order them to. Some of the commands are 'fire at will' or 'return fire only' or 'stack up' and prepare for entry into door. You can order your men to either assault upon entry or check your fire upon entry some the door entry commands are as follows -frag&clear-breach&clear-smoke & clear,flash & clear etc. Your men will also line up just about anywhere you point your crosshairs & (press A button) .You and your 2 men have  ability to Rappel and fast rope. While rappeling down the side of a casino you can invert yourself (click left stick)  and still rappel down and fire your handgun.ALSO you can order your men to 'ROPE UP' and they will  wait for you too order them to rappel, or they will fast rope down if given the opportunity. There's lots of rappel/fast rope opportunities on each level. The story was quite good and kept me interested in the characters you play with . I liked the cutscenes riding in the helicopter looking down at Vegas. The story also plays out in your HUD too kinda like a PIP on your TV,you'll get plot twists or story info on your P.I.P. or HUD while you and your men are stacking up on a doorway.It makes a nice twist to the old standard watch a 5 min movie cutscene between levels. Onto another issue the checkpoints came at the right times , sometimes I was relieved when I saw the 'saving now' signal. Personaly I like nicely placed checkpoints,I like the fact that you dont have to save every 10 feet just to survive to next level idea,and your not constantly going to your save screen in a game.This game might be too hard for some novice or intermediate gamers,as you have to plan your assaults wisely by using solid flanking technics and using your 'snake camera' under the door to spot enemies locations before assaults begin.In some of the casinos you'll have more than a dozen door/rappel/fast rope entrys to attack enemy. Not just the simple 2 door only flank entry. You can TAG up to 2 enemies for your men to take out first & second upon entry into the  room.(press back button) to red tag enemy when using your under door (snake camera). You have 2 levels of difficulty'normal' or 'realistic' I beat the game on both and found that realistic wasnt too much harder than normal. As far as bugs go ,Ive completed the game 3 times through and can only remember once where my squadmate got (buggy) stuck behind a door, and there was some very minor issues with my player not taking cover with the left trigger. But overall this game was very smooth ,no serious bug or slow down lag issues in my experience to really effect the gameplay. Onto weapons you have the ability to put silencers on about 75% of the weapons,when you do go silent your squadmates will do the same, you'll see them switch to there silenced sub-machine gun,I like the fact too that you can take the silencer off in game while playing.The weapons all fire and have a 'real world' feel. They sound and look good. Some of the weapons included are the MP9-MP5N-MP7A1-P90---UMP45-552 COMMANDO-AK47-AUGA3-FAMAS-G36C-G3KA4-M8-MTAR21-SCARHCQC-ETC.ETC. all of which can be customized by adding rifle scope,laser sight,reflex scope,acog scope,6x scope,etc.etc.Dropped enemy Ammo automaticly picks up( by walking over it) when you have the matching weapon for it, likewise you can pick up/switch enemy weapons with yours.You'll also have Ammo/weapon switch out Box (like the one in GRAW) in some locations in the levels. The surrounding areas takes damage as well like the slot machines will spew coins out when shot, the (fish shaped) lights hanging in the atrium  of the Calypso casino shatter when shot, etc. etc. All this adds realism and nice effect to the overall feel of the game...When you use cover (by pressing left trigger) it switches to 3rd person view, then when you leave or peak out from cover it goes back to 1st person. This transitions very well and never feels awkward or clumsy. Ive never played a game that felt so realistic graphicly ,there's so much detail everywhere I look.Some of the stuff I didnt see the first time through the game adds a nice touch, like the flower petals flowing out of the dragon heads mouths in the Buddah/asian themed 'Red Lotus'casino.The music/sound effects are done nicely as well , sounds very good on my stereo.This Game truly feels like a next gen game. A lot of work went into this game ,just walking back through a level youve just cleared of enemies and looking at all of the detail all around made me appreciate the game more. With the exception of the Dam level there's no bland industrial grey wall look to the game.You also have single player 'Terrorist Hunt ' mode ,the objective is to eliminate all terrorists on each map. And get this.. almost all 10 maps are completely different than the story mode and some of the maps arent even in the single player story campaign at all. With only a few being 'slightly' simular to the main campaign story mode. I cant remember if the 'terrorist hunt' mode opens up after finishing the main story campaign or not.... anyways its a HUGE bonus to the replayability of this game even without xbox live online.In terrorist hunt mode you play 'solo' and its hard but not to hard. You can set the difficulty level and set the enemy density from low-med-high. Anybody who is a fan of FPS/Squad games should definatly get this game. It has a HIGH replay value even for someone without Xbox Live. I didnt think there would be a game any better than Gears Of War (which is awesome too!) But along comes Rainbow Vegas in my opinion is even a step better. Rainbow Six Vegas is a definate must own game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2006"}

However, the necessary downside is the batteries that they consume.  Fortunately, there are rechargeable NiMH available for the controllers.  But how best to charge them so that you're never out of juice?Microsoft offers two options:  a plug-n-play wired solution and this Quick Charge Unit.  The speed, convenience and ease of this Quick Charge Unit make it the hands-down better way to go.The Quick Charge Unit will power up a fully-drained battery in about two hours;  contrast this to the 10+ that it takes the plug-n-play setup to accomplish the same thing.Also, the Quick Charge Unit is totally independent from your Xbox 360, as opposed to the plug-n-play which is physically wired to your 360 and requires that the 360 be on during recharging (yes, I know that you don't have to be actually playing to charge via the plug-n-play, but it IS keeping your 360 powered up, and thus wearing your expensive console down - is that really worth it to save some money on batteries?).The Quick Charge Unit is small - barely taller than the 360 itself, so you could very likely fit it in your entertainment shelves.  But you're free to keep it wherever you like - mine happens to sit in a bookshelf in a separate room from my 360. When a battery runs low, I just swap it out for a fresh one.  You can leave the batteries on the unit even after they're fully charged;  a red/green LED alerts you to the status of each battery in the charger.This package does come with one rechargeable NiMH battery, although the Quick Charge Unit has space to accommodate two at a time.This great accessory will immediately save you money on batteries and also preserve the life of your Xbox 360 console by not relegating it to the role of overly-expensive charger.

I enjoy shooters and thought this would be one hell of a game. But for me this game was not that great. I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about. The first thing that got me was that there is little to no story... Each level is independent and has nothing connecting it to the others. Each level is the same, but with different environments. Seriously how hard would it have been to connect these 4 stories into one and there actually be a goal for what you are doing? Maybe fight through all 4 levels, then get rescued? That wold have made more sense to me than being rescued in each level. I read somewhere that this game was made for mainly multiplayer. Really? Then why even add a single player campaign? I dont get the recent trend of game companies building games around MP anyway. Not everyone wants or even has access to online MP. I enjoy a good single player campaign where I can take my time and do things at my pace, which you can do here but theres no point in doing so. Speaking of the MP side of this game I dont have any friends that are online that have this game. And everytime I got into a MP game I was swiftly kicked out, didnt even get a chance to get a shot in... What fun is that?On the plus side this game was somewhat fun, for not having much of a main storyline. It was pretty cool fighting hordes and blowing up vomiting Zombies. I just wish there was more to it. All good games have a good story behind them. The impression I got from this was to venture wildy into the streets and shoot whatever that moves, for no purpose, other than to survive. Like I said before the 4 stories levels should have tied in somwhere and the game should have had a proper ending. Then it would have earned a 5 star game of the year rating, in my opinion.

What you get with Rocksmith 2014 is bonafide guitar lessons in an affordable, yet slick title that has its heart in the right place and provides a whole new way to learn the instrument. The mechanics are somewhat similar to Rock Band in that you're playing notes that come down a track but here, you're using an actual guitar in an environment that changes dynamically according to your skill level. The song selection is better than average with some stand out tracks provided by The Police, Alice in Chains and Radiohead just to name a few. There's also an entire plethora of lessons that have a very well produced video component accompanying them and they cover just about every facet of guitar playing and I think this is where you get your money's worth. The best thing I think is that the game's narrator is always patient, no matter how badly you're doing, so there's none of that anxiety over under performing in front of an instructor.The only thing that I wasn't particularly crazy about in regards to this game is in its need for an analog connection. Playing this game using either an optical or HDMI connection gives you a bit of audio lag, which is understandable seeing as how an electric guitar or bass is essentially an analog instrument. Thankfully, I didn't have to rewire my surround setup as I had initially feared but if you're currently running audio via optical or HDMI, you may want to see what your options are before you dive into Rocksmith. I currently have it setup so that I have both the HDMI and analog signal running in tandem to my receiver so I just need to make sure to switch between analog and digital.Rocksmith 2014 is a very impressive title that can actually help you learn how to play a real guitar and comes highly recommended.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

If you want fun online experience then I recommend UNREAL TOURNAMENT 2004 and also HALO and COUNTER-STRIKE are much better than this online. I only recommend this game because of the single player missions, and oh yeah this game isnt worth playing if its more than 20 bucks, and like most of the reviewes say: you need a powerful pc to play this. then you NEED A POWERFUL PC TO PLAY THIS!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Join \"The Darkness\"","reviewText":"\"The Darkness,\" from the studio that brought Xbox fans \"The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay,\" is a first-person shooter based on the dark comic book series of the same name. And like the aforementioned \"Riddick,\" it further proves that these guys know what makes a cool video game adaptation.You assume the role of Jackie Estacado, adopted nephew of Mafia boss Paulie Franchetti, as he reaches his 21st birthday and stumbles blindly into the dark destiny of his family line. The opening sequence is a knockout, and thrusts you headlong into the gritty world of organized crime in this fictional version of New York City. The ensuing police chase, car crash, and demise of your companions, a couple of Mafia thugs, is by itself worth the price of admission.Jackie soon finds himself on the receiving end of his Uncle Paulie's wrath, which brings him into contact with an evil entity known as The Darkness. This demonic parasite latches itself to Jackie, and simultaneously aids and defies him in his quest for revenge -- a quest with many shocking twists and turns that I dare not spoil in this review.The first-person gunplay of \"The Darkness\" is itself quite extraordinary. Shooting people is rarely this satisfying, thanks to copious amounts of gore, better-than-average rag doll physics, and a satisfying real world arsenal that never grows stale. But Jackie's Darkness powers certainly add the icing to this already tasty cake, allowing him to sprout serpentine tentacles that devour the hearts of his foes (for the purpose of leveling up Darkness powers)... and that's just the beginning. Other Darkness abilities allow you to impale your foes and swing them wildly around at the end of a glistening appendage, creep across the floor as a serpent and put a hole through an unsuspecting victim, and open up black holes that devour several enemies at once. It's all extremely gratifying, and provides ample means to destroy the opposition.Some Darkness abilities are less compelling than others, however. The Darkness Guns, for instance, rarely serve a useful purpose, while the aforementioned black holes act as overpowered grenades, and can sometimes shift the balance too far in the player's favor. Nonetheless, in a game where just shooting guys would be great, these alternatives do their part in further distinguishing the gameplay and making you feel like a real, bona fide bad@$$ with a sick, sadistic evil streak.Of course, the game isn't complete without the ability to summon Darklings -- funny gremlin-like beasties that will back you up in a pinch. With multiple varities, such as Gunners (equipped with massive chain guns), Berserkers (who ambush opponents and cut them down to size), and Kamikazes (they go BOOM!), things don't ever seem to get old.Production values are great across the board, from the near-flawless sound effects to the strength of the visuals, which depict a grimy New York City connected by subway tunnels and desolate streets under a sky of seemingly endless night. Maybe the streets are too desolate, point of fact, given that the City That Never Sleeps seems to be very asleep indeed, but it all adds to chilling atmosphere.The game takes a stab at the slightly open-ended nature of \"Butcher Bay,\" but doesn't quite nail it. This also results in lots and lots of walking between key action setpieces, and backtracking is never all that fun in any game. This game's attempts at non-linearity come across as tacked on, if anything, and will only do it for those who desperately want to drag out the experience.Despite a strong, compelling storyline, the Mafia element of \"The Darkness\" never met a cliche it didn't like. The Godfather meets Goodfellas dialog can be groan-inducing at times, especially all references to \"respect.\" There was a better way to handle this material, but this is a mere nitpick at worst.\"The Darkness\" is one of the best games available on the Xbox 360, bottom line. Do yourselves a favor and join the dark side.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2007"}

I wasn't expecting anything much for six bucks, but this game is surprisingly GREAT. It's the attention to detail in the surroundings, as well as the storyline that have me here.  Even the cut-scenes are fun to watch - even the loading screens between levels are entertaining!  You play a character who is part of a mob, but he's not your stereotypical Italian gangster.  He's a long-haired pale, soft-spoken guy who has a good heart but is just mixed up in something bigger than he is.  And on top of that, this weird \"Darkness\" thing that gives him powers, is just another thing to deal with.  The use of the powers is decent enough - you can send out a tentatcle ahead of you to scout ahead, which is extremely useful.  You can call upon a little minion sometimes to help you out.  The graphics are great, the storyline is unique, and it's just a lot of fun to play.  Much better than what I was expecting from a first-person-shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0014UGK8G","reviewerName":"C. O'Niell","summary":"Whatever the opposite of disappointed is...","reviewText":"I love the original Red Faction, I played on the PC and PS2 (pssst it's better on the PC) anyway, RF2 was alright but not as fantastic as the first one, RF has a pretty good story and the humor was great, but both where FPS games, so I was really worried they where going to hack up RFG as it is now a TPS.Well I'm about 50% done the single player campaign, and have logged many hours of online, I can not get enough Red Faction Guerilla.Single Player:This is great, we have tons of fun here. The maps are really nice, very easy to navigate, and very large. There is a great selection of missions ranging from destroying a building or structure as fast as humanly possible to extracting hostages' who are being probably tortured from your terrorist actions as new member of the Red Faction, all with out them dying.Driving around is actually really fun, I don't normally like driving in a game, but this was nice, all your vehicle options are distinctively different from each other, if you drive a big dump truck, it's slow and is terrible at cornering but you have a massive destructive power, being able to drive it through a building with ease. But if you are looking for fast and small with great handling, there is that to, but at the same time you give up that fantastic crushing capability.As far as weapons go you can upgrade everything at one of your safe houses after you collect \"salvage\" I actually liked doing this, it's like my goal to get as much salvage as I can possible get, the more the better. There is really a weapon for every situation your in, and when you run out of ammo, get your hammer out and start bashing everything in sight, you can take out buildings people walls trucks and just about anything that looks like it could brake, all with a little mining hammer. As like most games the more you play the more weapons you unlock and then you can buy them.There are ammo crates all over so if you find that there are to many EDF (Earth Defense Force, they are the enemy) around and not enough bullets or rockets then just load up and at the same time you can change you weapons selection as long as you have them unlocked.And the whole moral thing they have is neat, the higher the moral of the Red Faction the more ammo will be in the crate for you to reload with, they also help you fight when they are happy. If you die or a member of the RF dies, you get less ammo and they will also freak out and run away from a fight when the moral meter is low.Over all the single player is great so far, anyone who does not like it has not played for long enough, it's easy at first but once you get in to it, it's a quick jump to becoming more difficult and hopefully you have collected enough salvage to fight the good fight and free mars from the tyranny of the US government......Umm I mean the EDF, there couldn't be a major political parallel in RFG could there?Multiplayer:I won't spend to long on this but wow this just as fun as single player, maybe even more fun. They replace the run with a whole bunch of different backpacks, like a jet pack, my fav is the Rhino pack where you are able to smash through enemies and walls or both.The game types are the same as you would find in most multiplayer games, nothing new here, just that an enemy can come from anywhere, so essentially no cover, they will just hammer there way to you, and beat you down, as you cower in fear because you're out of ammo with no back pack and wish you picked up the Thrust pack to shoot out the top of the building only to die mid flight from some kid with a rocket launcher.RFG multiplayer = hours and hours of destructive endless fun.As for graphics, no it's not like there KZ2 or anything like that, but I just think it leaves miles of room for improvement in hopefully RF4 for whatever they call it. And it seems to be smooth, no jerking around or getting stuck on a corner, just great game play.My only real complaint is that there is no Co-op campaign, because come on that would be stellar in so many ways, maybe next time.And I do think if you play online this is totally worth full price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2009"}

I mean everything. You only have Liu-Kang and Kung Lao to start with for either Single, Ko-op or Vs. You have to unlock the other characters for Vs.You also have to unlock all the character's abilities, from their combos to their special abilities, by defeating enemies and getting EXP points (aha... so it's a RPG like X-men Legends you say?). Plus you can get other special special abilities such as wall run, swing, etc.The best part is the interaction of the environment and ALL the fatalities to choose from. Very gory good fun.It's a shame that you cannot pick from more characters to do the story, and if you're playing Ko-op, you cannot continue with just one character, you need both players to continue. So you pretty much need two games going to be able to finish the game. You cannot unlock everything with just one player either, there are special things that require Ko-op to complete.While its fun to work with a buddy on Ko-op, it's not available online, and you have to work together. If an enemy is outside the current area of the sceen, you have to wait for your friend to move enough to be able to attack it. This becomes extremely annoying when trying to unlock things and requiring an enemy to do so.Overall: It's a fun game and will take a long time to play and get everything.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2005"}

All of the spells  have been redone from BG's rather repetitive graphics, making spellcasting  a great deal of fun even though most of it is similar.

Baldur's Gate was notorious for  crashing and massive lag problems when played on a slow connection, but  this game runs as if you're playing by yourself when you're using a 56k  modem! Load times, ever a pain in BG, have been reduced drastically. I'm  rather astonished that they managed to fit all this onto only 2 CDs.

{"product_name":"B001NJ6AWO","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"An achievement/trophy hunter's dream come true!","reviewText":"Movie-licensed games nowadays are a very dodgy prospect, given that most of them are rush-released to coincide with the release of the movie. This was the case with G.I. Joe, Avatar, Transformers and The Last Airbender, and the results have been very underwhelming in all cases. Terminator: Salvation is really no different, however it is not a terrible game either and there is some fun to be had here.The plot of the movie is not followed here, rather you are part of a group that is fighting to survive in war-torn LA against a variety of deadly machines, including skeletal terminators that can lay waste to your group in no time. Each level is a strictly linear \"Point A to Point B\" affair in which you fight enemies, rescue survivors and complete various tasks. The plot is only slightly denser than helium and you are unlikely to find anything compelling here, but chances are that you're mostly playing this game for the achievement points or trophies, depending on which console you have this game for. However, as a third-person shooter, the game doesn't play badly and some of the fighting can be quite fun.The graphics, voice acting, and musical score of Terminator: Salvation are completely forgettable, but to be fair they are not horrible. LA looks suitably devastated and some of the animations and cut scenes are decent. What bogs the game down is glitches and bugs, and believe me that are many. We have a mess of disappearing weapons, teleporting enemies, and both your friendly AI and enemies getting stuck in the surroundings. Two memorable glitches include a \"Spider\" machine getting stuck in a wall and my guy getting stuck while running over a pothole, both of which prevented me from moving on and thus required me to reload the game from a previous checkpoint. At times, it felt like I was playing an unfinished game.So what is the selling point of this game? Without a doubt, it's the achievement points/trophies. If that's your thing, this game is easy to recommend since it is extremely generous in both the ease of obtaining them and the amount given. On the Xbox 360 version, you get 80 points for completing each level, and the full 1000 if you play through the game once on Hard difficulty. On the PS3, you get gold trophies after each level (9 in total) and a platinum for beating the game on hard. Not since \"Avatar: The Burning Earth\" has a game been this easy to rack up points with.If you're not concerned with achievements, is this game worthwhile? As a budget-price shooter, you could certainly do worse and this game does have some fun moments. Anyone expecting a brilliant game with good multiplayer and loads of replay value will definitely want to skip this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2010"}

It's not a GTA clone nor is it up there with Gears of War or Uncharted as far as shooting and covering go. It does however have a great story to tell with well-staged cut-scenes and some of the best graphics I've seen on a console.As I said before the story of Mafia 2 is excellent and VERY much carries the game. You play as Vito Scalletta, a poor Italian-American in the 1940's who, after fighting in WWII, finds himself drawn into the world of crime. Every character in Mafia 2 is well developed and well voice-acted and the story plays out very dynamically (starting in WWII Italy to a prison stretch to being a mafioso on the streets on Empire Bay) but is easy to follow.The graphics are also excellent in Mafia 2 and really bring the world to life. Snow and leaves fall, birds and cats move around on stoops and in alleys, and people go on about their daily lives while you are on a mission. The building interiors look especially good like they were taken out of an episode of 'Mad Men'. The character models are surprisingly detailed as well.While the presentation of Mafia 2 is a wonder to behold, the gameplay is very disappointing. The controls are shaky when you're just walking around. Driving around takes some getting used to but is fun overall, same with hand-to-hand combat. Shooting and covering however is lacking: namely you can't blind-fire from cover. Normally I wouldn't mind (I mean you can't blind-fire in Mass Effect either) but when your enemies CAN blind-fire from cover and with some of them trying to rush you, gun-fights can get frustrating.Mafia 2 is also very linear. I don't mind that there's no side-missions (which I rarely partook in games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption) but the basic story-missions almost never have alternate paths. This is a shame because there's a couple really good stealth-missions thrown into the mix that could've benefitted from non-linear solutions. In fact I think the game needed more stealth missions because I had more fun on those than the actual gun-fight and chase missions (or at least have a stealth optional solution to most missions, I mean I ASSUME the criminal underworld doesn't want this much attention drawn to itself!).Despite my complaints Mafia 2 is still a worth-while game. It took me about 10 hours to beat which is average for a linear action game. If you love good gangster stories like I do you'll love the narrative of Mafia 2. If you're looking for a more well-polished gaming experience best to save your money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0009Z3K9E","description":"In order to save himself and protect the lives of those he loves, Soma must infiltrate the enemy's home base, a towering replica of Dracula's castle that is teaming with monstrous creatures. Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Castlevania whips the DS","reviewText":"Konami struck gold by bringing the Castlevania series to the Game Boy Advance with Castlevania: Circle of the Moon. It is one of the highest rated games in the franchise and back in 2001 showed that the gothic art and the whip action could work on a handheld. After two more successful games with Harmony of Dissonance and Aria of Sorrow, Konami hit the fourth note with Dawn of Sorrow, which is quite easily the best of all four handheld titles and even one of the best DS games to date.Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is the prequel to this game, and the story revolved around a man named Soma Cruz as he traveled through Dracula's Castle to save the world from an apocalyptic eclipse. I won't ruin the outcome of that game, but in Dawn of Sorrow, you again control Soma in his quest to solve the mystery and reason behind his powers that he finds in Aria of Sorrow. A strange run-in with a member of a mysterious cult sends Soma to another castle where he hopes to wrap up his troubles once and for all, living peacefully in the world he worked so hard to save.The story hasn't been altered, but added on. Similarly, the two-dimensional gameplay hasn't had much of a change but there have been several notable additions. For those who haven't tried Aria, Soma could find and equip dozens upon dozens of different weapons. Each of these weapons had different stats and could be swung, thrown, or shot in a different way. Slower weapons, like axes and great swords, were generally more powerful. Faster weapons, like short swords and knives, were slightly weaker. Depending on the player, each and every weapon had potential to be useful tools in killing Dracula's minions. On top of all the weapons, the soul-collecting system in Aria that allowed for different abilities is back.Now, on top of collecting and using projectile, ability, and status souls, the souls can be harvested and fused into weapons to improve upon their stats. This essentially makes soul-collecting a priority, but it's addictive all the same. To balance out the ease of leveling-up and collecting souls, Konami raised the difficulty bar on some of the bosses, making for some of the most hectic and difficult fights on any of the four handheld games.To increase the difficulty, and to make a cheap use of the DS' touch screen function, the player now has to memorize and draw \"Magic Seals\" that finish off bosses. If the player fails to correctly draw the Magic Seal, the boss is revitalized with a fraction of its health and the fight will continue until the player draws the Seal correctly. This is the biggest use of the stylus that I found, but I'm not disappointed--the gameplay is so beautifully simplistic yet so artfully balanced that throwing in a bunch of touch-screen crap would have ruined the system. Nice move, Konami.Aria of Sorrow was a beautiful Game Boy Advance game, and Dawn of Sorrow simply adds on with more detail and smoother animation. Things like zombies being cut into halves, huge walking armors collapsing into rubble, and demons being sucked into vortexes are just a few examples of the attention to detail shown in Dawn of Sorrow. On top of this, the music and sound effects are exceptional to say the least. The epic introduction tune, combined with the fact that it's an anime-inspired clip, is enough to win me over but the detail from the graphics also carries over into the sound. Soma's little \"HA!\" noise when he attacks isn't what I'm talking about; enemies have distinct sounds, and in some instances, like boss fights, sound is almost as important as visuals. The goth-tastic score only adds to the feeling of the environment. Overall, this is a superficially perfect handheld game.Take a simple gameplay concept and add a shot of addiction, sprinkle in a great story, and coat it in graphics and music that are sweeter than cake icing and you have Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, which is one of the best DS games of the year and one of my favorite handheld games. It doesn't really use the DS' functions but it's a great game all on its own and belongs in your DS library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

Well this is an action/adventure game not a warfare strategy title. So RE5 then is crap aswell because every boss in a fight follows a pattern and once you understand it you can take it down?? IT`S A GAME!Mercenaries are like the only type of enemies in the game yes I agree but we are looking at some improvements, heavy weaponry, riot shields, and guys in aromored suits making it harder.Anyway what this really is:A fantastic game, inmersive and entreteining, best graphics out there, incredible cinematics and a great story line just like on the first game of the saga. I`m really waiting for this to become a movie because it has it all.It`s not fair to rate down this game comparing to what it should have and is not even available in the market, compare it to other games out there and it speaks for itself.I do suggest to play the first game before this one it`s not mandatory but you will enjoy the story more cause you can`t help but falling in love with the characters and that is a hard thing to do with game characters... possible here thanx to the brilliant acting and script.this is a work of art!!!go get it, have fun!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS7","description":"GAME CARTRIDGE CLEAN WITH CASE, NO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS. [A FUN GAME]","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"....left a lot to be desired","reviewText":"Gamers were knee deep with the Super NES and Sega Genesis back in 1993. But the NES was still cranking out games whether gamers liked it or not. For those who had the SNES, Capcom released Mega Man X and was very well received by critics and gamers. In 1994, they released the last entry in the NES Mega Man series with Mega Man 6. Incidentally, Capcom was too busy making Mega Man X and Mega Man 6 at the time so they let Nintendo publish the game for them. While it brought a few new ideas as well as the standard run and gun game play, the last NES Mega Man game left a lot to be desired.Mega Man 6 started off with a robot tournament in full swing that got taken over by Mr. X. He took control of the eight most powerful robot entries and let them run wild in the city. Mega Man swings into action to stop him once and for all. Of course, it doesn't take long to realize Mr. X was Dr. Wily in disguise, so you have eight stages to choose from and two castles to explore, each with 4 stages for a total of 16 stages. You know the drill: pick a stage, beat the Robot Master and get his weapon to use on another Robot Master. To mix things up a bit, the Robot Masters were created by fans of the series, not by Capcom. Some of the stages have alternate paths where one leads to the Robot Master while the other leads to a \"fake\" version of the Robot Master. Mega Man can now combine powers with his dog Rush after you collect two Rush adapters. Of course, the robot bird Beat from Mega Man 5 returns and will help you once you collect the letters that spell out his name. When you want to take a break, you can write down a password so you can continue your game later.The PROS: It was nice for Capcom to finally try to shake up the traditional formula it followed with all of their Mega Man games. It looked and played like the games before it. The music, while not as strong as what you heard in Mega Man 5, still sounded good. The controls remain untouched so they still work.The CONS: Previous Mega Man games looked better than Mega Man 6. Even though the Robot Masters are the creations of the contest winners, Capcom could have picked better choices. Most of the Robot Masters were based on elements that were already seen (water, ice, fire, air) so that created a sense of redundancy. Judging from the stage layouts, you could tell that Capcom was running out of ideas.With the release of Mega Man 6, the series came to a close on the NES but continued on the Super NES with Mega Man 7. Capcom would move forward with the Mega Man X series. Some people liked Mega Man 6 while others were disappointed because it really didn't bring anything new to the series. It's a shame since it could have ended on a high note.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Those who think this is an amazing game with top notch graphics, original gameplay and a game of the year contender.  Or there are those who think Assassin's Creed is boring and repetitive.I fall slightly more towards the former, hence the 4 star review.  In the wake of Bioshock, Halo 3 and Mass Effect anything released right now has to be a triple A title to even get noticed.  Had this game come out last year it would have been a triple A title rather than an A-.In Assassin's Creed you are a stealth assassin.  If you enjoy games like Hitman Blood Money and Splinter Cell you'll love this game.  You slowly and quietly move in for your kill.  Instead of a sniper rifle you lock on and throw knives.  Instead of fiber wire or a silenced pistol you have a hidden blade.  If the crap hits the fan you have a long sword and a short sword to fend off guards.People claim Assassin's Creed is boring and repetitive, because you sometimes have to move through the crowd slowly to remain undetected.  Also for each target you have to gather info and save citizens.  Personally I enjoyed these activities so I didn't think of it as a drag.So if you're still undecided ask yourself if you either:A) Need constant action and no story whatsoever.B) Have the patience to walk slowly through a crowd of people and allow a plot to unfold.If you lean more towards B then I highly recommend this game.  If you lean more towards A then check out The Club.  Run and Gun would have been a more accurate title.There's also been talk around the internets that Assassin's Creed is Pro-Muslim and Anti-Christian.  From the perspective of someone that's played the game to completion, that's simply untrue.  As an assassin you kill both Christians and Muslims (even Atheists).  In fact if anything this game is Anti-Organized-Religion.  The game even says at the beginning that it is a work of fiction, just to keep people from getting upset.  (Disclaimers never stop people from getting upset though)  If you're easily offended steer clear of this title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2008"}

Gebbia","summary":"I am very pleased!!!","reviewText":"I was kind of shocked to hear that EA was coming out with BF4 so fast, in my opinion they could have kept BF3 going for quite some time will upgrades and expansions.  Now lets get to the game!!!SINGLE PLAYERI am unlike the majority of gamers because I always like to play through the single player first then Multiplayer.  I do this becasue I enjoy playing the single player as well as seeing most of the weapons before hand.  I really enjoyed single player, and I also enjoyed BF3 single player along with all the COD's that I have played but BF single player is the only ones that I actually payed attention to the story lines. It is short but if you didn't expect that I don't know what to tell you.  Should they make it longer...of course but I don't think that will happen.  They did make little changes that I really enjoyed, and they are below:PROS:- They made it wear you get to pick your weapons from your weapons cache for each level and you can pick up enemy weapons or change your load out at any ammo cache or weapons cache throughout the level.  I really enjoyed this aspect for the fact that I like to have a long range and medium range weapon.- It kind of reminded me of playing multipler a little bit.  You get points for killing enemies and more for headshots or alternate kills and your points go up against medals for each level, Bronze, Silver, Gold.  Each medal you get, you unlock weapons for your weapons cache's that you can use in Singleplayer.- It seemed a little more open, at times you would come across a random tank and you could either get in it or go on foot.  You can blow up a tank with a tank or get out and C4 it, or take it down with a rocket launcher of SortsCONS- Obviously short but I expected it- The ending was ok but I expected a lot more.  It just seemed that it just kind of ended, like there is going to be more but then nothing happened.- The singleplayer crashed twice on me while I was playing it.  Didn't loose too much progress but had to restart the entire game.MULTIPLAYERI have logged about 10 hours on multiplayer and I must say I am overall, pleased.  Here are the pros and consPROS:- Huge maps (Ofcourse) and all of them that I have played have some sort of interaction that happens in the map.  Such as one map floods, huge destruction in others, and an island map that in the middle a storm rolls in and creates big waves and low visability.  Makes the gameplay amazing.- Lots of weapons with lots of attachments.  Multiple rocket launchers that do all kinds of stuff- One of the main changes I have seen is they took the C4 away from Support and gave it to Recon.  So now your not completely worthless as a sniper when it comes to tanks.- They also added little Ammo and Health pacs as well as keeping the big ones from BF3 and you can equipt which ever one to use as Medic or Support.  I did notice that the small ammo pack only gives you ammo for your pistol and sidearm, it does not fill your grenades and rockets.- You can zoom in and out with one of the scopes and you can set your range on some of them.  Which is a nice feature.- They have weapon drops throughout the game now with random weapons that you can go and get.  They are marked on the map with a pistol.- Ocean Warefare.  The vehicles for the water are awesome, especially the but war boat(Can't remember the name)They also have dingys, sea-doos.  This plus the waves in the storm are pretty epic.- Another bit thing that I really like is the fact that you can dive and swim UNDERWATER as well as pull your pistol and shoot while treading water.  So now your not completely worthless while swimming anymore.CONS- CRASHES, I played for 2-3 hours last and it crashed 4 times.  Twice while switching levels which didnt upset me to bad but then the other 2 times were during the game after I had unlocked multiple things and made quite a few points.  That upsets me.  It has crashed quite a few times since I have had the game so I hope they work out the bugs- SOUND I will be playing a round and the surrounding sound will go away except my gunfire.  Then it will come back and go away again.  I see there are multiple people having this problem so I Hope they fix that soon.  It doesn't happen every round but most of them.I will think of more things as I play and I will update as needed.  Thank you for reading and have fun gaming.-NickUPDATE November 14 2013So these things have been going on since the beginning and I knocked off a star because of it.  I waited for a big update and that came today but it still has some ridiculous issues.LOOSING XP- So in the beginning a server would crash and you would loose your points in that round....that does not happen as often now but it still happens.- The one thing that really pisses me off is when I finish a round and I quit before it loads the next map and it says BF4 has stopped working and I loose about a 1/3 of my XP from that round.  THAT NEEDS to be FIXED.  I am tired of getting the same rank 3-4 times before it finally takes.  Just to name a couple I ranked up to level 11 4 times and level 29 3 times because it does not keep my xp.  At one point I played 3 rounds, got my longest headshot and gained around 30k points and unlocked 6 things and I quit after the third round and it didnt keep any of my stats from those 3 games.....wow really?  I dont mind if it happened every now and then but this is ridiculous.I waited for the update and when I joined my first map every 15 seconds or so my screen would go a little fuzzy for a split second and come back.  Updated drivers and it worked for about a round and it still does it every now and then. Also my first 2 rounds after the update my teamates were killing me (I only play HC servers) saying I didnt have a friendly symbol above my head and I was also killed by multiple people that had a friendly symbol and it said they were the enemy.All and all I don't see much of an improvement...yet...please make another update!!!UPDATE 27 November 2013CRASHES:- I hardly come by a crash anymore.  The game has crashed once in the last 15hrs of gameplay and that was about 10 seconds after joining a server.HIT COLLISION- There seems to be something off with the hit collision in the game and it seems to be getting worse, at least in my opinion.  I play only HC servers and in multiple maps with multiple enemy's I would hit them with no less than 20-30 rounds and I could see the bullets hitting them and this is at close range without them moving, but they never go down and they still read 100 on health.  Using the same pistol in everymap usually you can kill enemies with 2-4 bullets and less if it was in the head.  But them some enemies take and entire clip and still read full health.  This is the main thing upsetting me in this game now.COVER- Enemies can shoot me from behind cover just with the tips of their heads sticking out, and I mean the tip...barely visable.  My friend and I tested this out and when we got behind cover and had the same amount showing and fired a round it just hit the cover in front of us.  Not a huge deal but it gets frustrating.All and all I am really enjoying the game.  I just wanted to update you on some things that caught my eye.  Thanks for reading and I hope to see you in there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

However if driving is your thing Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is the one you want to play first. I found the driving mechanics better in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.  The Need for Speed Hot Pursuit story is not episodic and disjointed as Burnout Paradise.  The graphics in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit are far better that those in Burnout Paradise, (Think Infamous 1 verus Infamous 2 upgrade in graphics quality!)  Hyper Realism in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit comes at a price of making the cars harder to control for the novice to driving games.  If you want a driving game to practice and hone your driving skills on I'd suggest Burnout Paradise.  However after Burnout Paradise you must definitely buy Need for Speed Hot Pursuit since this game will definitely take your game driving skills to the next level.  This is a cops and robbers game of your dreams where you get to be a psycho crook or psycho police officer behind the wheel a lot like \"Dirty Harry!\"The night time driving is very convincing in its realism.  The game did not glitch much even during the fast paced racing scenes.  Like the real thing each car has its strong points and its not so strong points so doing well in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is always about having the right vehicle for the right driving challenge.  The game world is large enough with enough variation to keep things interesting.  At this price point buying Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is almost a non brainer if you like a challenging sophisticated driving game where the thrills do not easily get stale.  I do not drive in real life because; I have autism, cerebral palsy and other disabilities so I am a real jerk behind the wheel in this game.  I really enjoy all the trouble Need for this Speed Hot Pursuit game lets me get into.  The basic Crown Vic type police car rides just like the real thing.  It has a powerful engine but can be nimble only if you master its many quirks.  I don't want to include any spoilers so I will end this review by saying I enjoyed Need for Speed Hot Pursuit it takes getting used to but I like it.  You must understand that while I still have cerebral palsy and other disabilities I have played video games for over 2 years now. I'll never be good at video games but I do well on causal levels now and in some video games I survive nicely on Normal.  On one video game I won the game on Veteran difficulty.  I will never win a game on Insane difficulty.  I say this because; games I once said were extremely hard are a bit easier for me now.  Only game I can't play because it is too hard is Borderlands 2.

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date.

This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future.

Thanks to the handy people over at Ready at Dawn (Daxter) they faithfully translated Kratos into a pint sized angry little man. Instead of talking about what you already know about God of War (everyone should have played at least one...you all own a PS2) let's talk about what's new. First thing you'll notice are the PS2 quality graphics (I mean that to the letter) and all the production values from the PS2 games. We have a new story, which is between 1 and 2, where Kratos is once again seeking the forgiveness of his past but the Gods still deny him.You have some new weapons such as the Gauntlet of Zeus which lets you punch the crap out of everyone, a new Sun Shield which blocks attacks pretty well, along with some new magic like Efreet (fire FTW!), the Mask of Charon (stuns enemies), and the Light of Dawn (a projectile) along with some new moves. You can upgrade everything just like in previous games as well. While everything for CoO is hand tailored (done from scratch nothing from the consoles is in here) you can't tell the difference. While you also get some more nude women (Eos is HOT!), tons more gore, and some new enemies and button time sequences you'll never get bored with the game (for the whole 5 hours it takes to beat) there are plenty of unlockables and you'll more than likely play through this more than once (I'm already on my second go through on God Mode).Every action-adventure fan MUST BUY THIS! This is also a great reason to buy a PSP.

{"product_name":"B008GEH8LQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Good overall improvement over 3DS","reviewText":"I was a 3DS early adopter, having loved the DS and being a bit too caught-up in the 3D hype. That means I did get burned on that, having bought the original for the full launch price of $250 (thanks for the free GBA games Nintendo, but they really aren't worth $80). That said, I liked the 3DS. It had backward compatibility with DS games, the 3D was a neat touch (and pretty darn revolutionary at the time) and I even liked the new menu system with the ability to download content to SD card. Since launch, Nintendo has started offering complete downloadable games which is great- saves having to carry around a lot of game cards which are always so easy to lose.There were a few things, of course, that I didn't like about the old 3DS. First, battery life- while it isn't quite as bad as the Sega Game Gear, it was pretty bad compared to the DS Lite (or the regular DS for that matter). Second, I found the keys to be a bit stiff, reminding me of those first-generation Logitech game controllers. Lastly, the cameras were weak- effectively useless for taking real pictures and little more than a novelty.First off, to make one thing clear: unlike usual Nintendo handheld hardware refreshes, 3DS XL is not like the DS Lite or GBA SP- it isn't supposed to render the original 3DS obsolete by being better in every way. It's being sold and marketed in parallel to the original (at a $30 higher pricepoint) and is better in some ways and worse in others. Here is the general breakdown:Better:Screens- most obviously the screens are much larger, making it easier to see and use 3D.Battery life- on stock power it does last longer (1/2-1 hr more depending on use).Keys- they are softer and more responsive, and make less noise.Stylus- no longer telescoping.Worse:Weight- it's heavier.Size- it's wider and taller (though surprisingly, not thicker), can be a bit much for little hands.Same:Cameras- yeah, unfortunately they still suck.Features- same menu system, buttons, sliders, input, etc.Other hardware- SDHC (up to 32 GB), wifi (2.4 ghz b/g), sound, mic, processor, card slot, etc.Obviously, the increased screen size is the biggest draw, and alone more than justifies the difference in price. I'd even go so far as to say it's worth upgrading from a regular 3DS for this alone, especially if your eyesight is less than perfect. The resolution is unchanged, but it really doesn't matter much- the original 3DS had way too many pixels per inch for a handheld game system; spreading them out a bit does not hurt at all. It makes it much easier to make out detail in 3DS titles that would otherwise be overlooked, easier to read text,, and easier to use the touch controls on the lower screen. It also makes the 3D work a lot better at more reasonable range- I often had to have the old 3DS right in front of my face to use this and eventually ended up just turning it off in most games. Glare is also noticeably reduced in bright light, even without any antiglare film on it.The key design is definitely improved. The new 3DS buttons feel more like the DS Lite's than the GBA SPs, which is a good thing. Aside from the button feel, the old inline pressure-sensitive keys for start/select/home are now actual keys and much bigger. The sliders are bigger and easier to access, and the power button is recessed so you won't hit it on accident. I can't find anything to complain about with the new key layout- perhaps the only nitpick is the joystick ('circle pad') is no bigger.Battery life is slightly improved on the base unit. I should note though that there's a lot of cheap, very effective 3DS extended batteries for sale (I used the Nyko one). However, the only 3DS XL high capacity battery I've seen is a very expensive Japanese model (MSRP $100- yikes). It's probably both cheaper and easier to get a USB battery pack and cable. The XL uses the same charging port/voltage as the original 3DS. It comes packed with an AC adapter.That said, there are a few unchanged things that are a bit of a letdown: no upgraded cameras, wi-fi, or processor. One would have thought with all that extra space, they'd have done something more than just add bigger screens and battery... but nope, doesn't look like it. Additionally, though the internal battery does last longer, it isn't a whole lot longer. It's a far cry from the 5+ hour boost the DS Lite gave over the vanilla DS. Most of the gains in battery size/capacity are negated by the power it takes to run the bigger screens.A few added notes- the LED power/wireless indicators on the original 3DS were big, bright, and could be pretty distracting in the dark. The new ones are much more subdued while still being visible. I also feel that the contoured case is a lot nicer to hold than the original, even if it's heavier and larger. The standard 3DS felt a bit blocky with its sharp edges, though of course there are plenty of add-on cases that can fix that. I'll admit I rarely used the old 3DS stylus because it was simply too hard to pull out. The new one is pretty much identical to the DS Lite's, though on the other hand the touch screen is so much bigger that it isn't hard to just use your fingers.If you haven't got a 3DS yet and are aiming to buy one, the XL is almost a no-brainer choice. It's only $30 more and the pros over the vanilla 3DS definitely outweigh the cons. About the only situation in which I'd say the regular 3DS is better is if you're a small person and want to carry it around in small pockets, or if you really really want one of the limited edition 3DS units.If you already have a 3DS the upgrade choice is a bit tougher, but I'd say it's still worth it. Give your 3DS to a friend and stop squinting at the screen, or sell it (the original still fetches good resale price). If you're skeptical about how much better the screens are, go check it out in a store. It's very likely this will convince you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2013"}

I included myself amongst the many watching that immediately wanted a 3DS.  Now, I own a 3DS and after what seemed forever since I had pre-ordered the game, Kid Icarus Uprising has finally been dropped upon us.  Was it worth the wait?  Oh heck yeah!First, you gotta praise Project Sora and Nintendo for breathing a new kinda life into a long-beloved but under-appreciated franchise.  Kid Icarus has obviously never looked better, and thanks to the 3DS hardware it's really hard to turn away from once you have the game in your hands.  However, when reviews began going live and critics started squabbling about the stylus-heavy controls, I got nervous.  Being a lefty, I hadn't had the chance to obtain a Circle Pad Pro so I hoped all week long that I'd be able to adjust to the controls without getting completely cramped up.Now that the game's here, I can say for the most part that my hopes and prayers were answered.  Like Game Informer said, this game comes with a plastic stand for a reason:  Unless you really plan on playing this game on the go right off the bat, you NEED it.  This stand has been a huge relief for me, especially being a lefty.  The stand has rubber grips on the bottom so it never slides all over the place unless you get really clumsy with it.  There's also space so you can put on headphones and/or charge while playing.  yes, it kills the portability, but it's honestly the best way I can think of playing Uprising right now, being a gamer that prefers couch gaming to on-the-go gaming.Anyway, using the stand I didn't notice any severe cramping.  Controls are simpler than they sound:  The Circle Pad is how you dodge and move, 'L' is Fire, and you use the stylus to aim and look around.  Admittedly, the ground sequences get very tricky if you're not on your toes.  However, a focused and determined player can play it without an issue generally.  The rail sequences, which also received criticisms for basically the game \"playing for you,\" I've noticed are unfounded complaints.  While it DOES INDEED move you around, doing this allows you to focus on shooting and dodging, which once you begin really sinking into the gameplay becomes extremely invaluable.Reviews have also been pointing out the upgrading and weapon system in the game, which I absolutely agree with.  There are an abundance of items to unlock in this game.  I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, but that's okay because that means this game will give me my money's worth.The one thing I largely ignored were the AR cards.  I appreciate the collector value of these, and they are definitely neat to check out.  However, I noticed that some of the included cards didn't seem to read properly.  Perhaps I didn't do something right, but then again I paid $40 for a video game, not a card reader.  And for the video game part's sake, I'm willing to forgive something like this. :)  Anyway, if you're even remotely curious about playing this game, definitely do so.  However, embrace the stand.  Do not be afraid.  Because when it all comes down to it, this is the 3DS game you know you've been waiting for!Thanks for reading, and I hope my review helped you out!-JackP.S.

The game is great, and it is probably the best computer game out there......Until you load up the game. To start up the game got faster, but the game is way too slow and choppy. I got a Windows XP and I just got it and the game is choppy. I got Techinal Support help and they told me to do these things, but the game was still slow. if you have an XP and have overall a lot of patience, you MAYBE can handle this game. If you ahve anything lower then Windows XP, then you can forget about it. The game has a lot of stuff, but you can't play with the stuff unless you either can deal with waiting 5 minutes just to get into your house from the start screen.The game though is amazing. You can select your clothes instead of the old Sims. This game blows the old one away, but it is unbearably slow. My opinion is if you can deal with the slow stuff, you will love it. If you hate choppy games and can't stand loading times, then don't waste $50 dollars.Pros:- You can do almost anything you ever wanted to do in your old Sims game, probably ever more then you dreamed of.- You have these little aspiration meters and what you want to do in your life. Do you want to be the smart one, the greedy one or the family guy?- Tons of new options on every item in the game and much more building options, like more then two levels in your house, unlike the basic 2 in the old sims.- Be an toddler, child, teenager, adult or an elder and watch your Sims age, be born and eventually die.Cons:- Slow and choppy gameplay and extremely slow loading time take away a lot of fun of the game.- The graphics are not like the old Sims, and the objects look very pixalated and cartoonish.Overall, this game would be a legend if a computer can handle it's size and if they made it a littler like the old Sims instead of tweaking everything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000HGOHWO","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Dated visuals, Excellent tactical shooter","reviewText":"There are a number of things you will probably dig straight away.The weapons are realistic. The cover system is what every cover system should be. Balance is perfected; even sniper rifles and shotguns may serve you well strategically. Gimmicks like snake-camming under doors prior to breaching and inverted rappels down the sides of casinos are executed supremely well. Multiple routes exist in almost all scenarios. Tactical team play is encouraged. Four people can play through the campaign together online, and with mics! And so the list of pros goes on and on...That doesn't mean that the game is without flaws. The most striking thing will be the visuals. You'll begin the game in Mexico, where everything continually looks like it's caked in dirt. Color there really is a rarity. Eventually you make it to Vegas where things brighten in a major way, but you will notice the age of this graphical engine. Sound can be hit or miss in online playthroughs. I once played for two hours with friends, unable to hear my own gunfire. Goals are sometimes obscure and not pointed out very well, leaving you feeling as though your game has glitched if you can't find the right spot to activate the next objective. Night vision is AWESOME at close range, but comes up short when sniping (what you'll most likely want to use it for). Lastly, you can't run in this game. Rarely will you find yourself wanting to, but it does take away from the experience when you find yourself wanting to.Still, flaws and all, I still have to give this game a four star rating. The reason for that is that it delivers a multi-player, tactical experience rarely seen in our modern gaming era. If oldschool Socom games were first person and you could play through them online with friends, geared up with some new tricks (like the cover system and rappel options); then you've some idea of what to expect. If the game received a graphical facelift and a trophy support patch, it would be an undeniable five star game. But it is, nonetheless, a great experience. And the second game in the series is even better! Being as cheap as this is, I have to recommend it to anyone who likes tactical gunplay, with an intuitive control layout, and squad-based commands at the ready. Having played most of the newer, prettier shooters on the market, I think I can safely say that this game is still a beast to be reckoned with. So buy now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

Master Chief looks just like he did in Halo, meaning he looks pretty terrible (as do the human characters), especially compared to his Halo 3 model. I forgot how much backtracking there was in this game (I'd say about a third of the game is backtracking), some levels still just go on way too long, and the final driving section of the game can be annoying because of the sloppy Warthog controls (which Bungie basically admitted were bad, because they significantly tightened up the driving controls from Halo 2 onwards). The animations are dated, and I wish they would have gotten rid of some of the awful character stereotypes, which can be pretty painful to listen to. On the plus side, Halo still has a great feel for a console FPS, and I do like the Halo story/universe- Master Chief is a pretty cool character. I don't play really Halo for multiplayer, but there is definitely plenty of content there.

you'll have to play it yourself. my reason for writing is to clear up some complaints that might scare off a new player and reassure you that the criticisms are a matter of taste, not quality; the game does rule even if it's not for everybody.---for starters, the controls function perfectly- it's players who have the problem. it needs to be understood that there's a difference between 'bad' controls and 'difficult' controls. the learning curve is steep and you'll have to experiment a few hours before feeling confident, but the payoff is that samus is finally nimble and fun to control in 3D.the D pad excels at maneuvering samus in 3 dimensions. the camera angles have been set to allow you to press in one direction and make samus run exactly where you want to go, feeling reminiscent of super metroid or fusion with nothing lost in translation to 3D. it's practically a necessity after the triumphant return of the speed booster, which requires running in straight lines over long distances, a simple task which fidgety analog sticks would have made difficult.the D pad also allows you to dodge enemy attacks by quickly pressing any direction before the hit. the move quickly becomes second nature and is beyond indispensable, as even the early the enemies in the game are challenging. melee attacks are another welcome addition and typically are as simple as running into an enemy with a full charge beam... it's hard to understand how immensely satisfying it is to pull one of them off until you've done it yourself.the largest alteration to combat is the concentration move, which allows you to refill one energy tank when health is critically low (similar to 'crystal flash' from super metroid). there are no health pickups otherwise and the only way to fully refill is to visit a save station, which there are plenty of. this system makes the player much more protective of samus' life while exploring the ship, putting an emphasis on survival and forcing you to be more thoughtful about when and how to engage enemies.the rest of the 3rd person controls are pulled straight from the old games; hammer 1 to shoot, 2 to jump. the game uses auto targeting to compensate for the difficulty of aiming in 3D space, but don't let anyone fool you for a second into thinking it does all the work for you. you still have to direct samus towards your target with a surprising amount of precision in order for it to reliably lock, making it feel like a good balance between automatic and manual control.--the 1st person mode works well once you've learned when and where to use it. overall, it feels like the stationary aiming from zelda with metroid corruption's controls. being frozen in place is a meaningless limitation since moving would disturb you while studying the environment and you only hang around in combat long enough to fire a missile or two anyway (at least you should be). coping with the switch can initially be disorienting, but a few hours in you'll find yourself instinctively swinging the remote around to take a closer look at things without even realizing it.recognizing windows of opportunity to safely switch perspectives is a key part of the strategy and if you choose a bad moment, you choose a bad moment. in the event that you do enter at the wrong time, however, you can easily dodge with a swing of the remote and keep firing or return to third person find a better spot. the game alerts you when an attack from any direction is incoming with a yellow glow on samus' visor, placing all the fault on the player if they fail to utilize what is in the end a pretty forgiving dodge system.to summarize- if you could handle an snes controller for super metroid and a wiimote for corruption, you can handle this scheme. the controls allow for intense and unique gameplay that demands a lot of attention, which may not appeal to everyone, but in the hands of a good player there's no denying that they work.---as for the game itself, the sinister atmosphere is present and stronger than ever, at times approaching survival horror territory. the environments are not the achievements in art direction that retro studios' were, but still beautiful and unbelievable in  scale. the enemy design and boss fights, on the other hand, are among the best of any metroid to date.the graphics can easily be said to be the wii's best and this late in the console's life cycle that's not likely to change. the music is very different than the usual metroid fare, so if you're hoping for kenji yamamoto's memorable themes you'll be disappointed, although kuniaki haishima's orchestrated score is a better match for this story.speaking of, typical video game awkwardness aside the story is very compelling. samus has never been given much character before, remaining a blank slate like mario and link, but other m remains faithful to the few glimpses of her character the series has given so far- her bond with the baby metroid from metroid II, her relationship with adam detailed in fusion, and her uncompromising decision making that nearly revived the space pirates in super metroid. whether or not the samus in this game ruins your own personal image of her character, it in now way contradicts the character established in the games so far.if you're open minded and willing to experience a metroid that looks, plays, and feels different than anything before it then you will other m enjoy regardless of whether you like every decision the developers made or not. if you've already got something against it going in then you're guaranteed to come out hating it with nothing to gain. the only thing that can keep you from appreciating a revolutionary game like this is yourself, so let go of whatever prejudices you've picked up and enjoy it the way it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Shaimun","summary":"Best Uncharted Game!","reviewText":"I have recently bought Uncharted Greatest Hits dual-pack so I am reviewing both games.Wow, I can't say enough great things about Uncharted: Among Thieves. It is so much more than just a game. It is a lot of things. There is just too much depth that I can't explain. I had a good experience with Uncharted: Drakes Fortune. I have even a better one with Uncharted: Among Thieves.The developer Naughty Dog certainly improved many of the game's elements. The graphics are nice compared to some games that were released later than 2009. I bought the non-goty version for my brother back in 2009 and then I took it from him to sell it. Wow I can't believe I ignored this gem while my brother was playing it. It worked out I guess, since I have all the DLC for it now. Highlights of the DLC include a motion picture comic title \"Eye of Indra\"The game plays more smoothly than Drakes Fortune. I love seeing the characters again. I liked the storyline. There was character development just like in tv shows and movies. There is plenty of action in the game but there are times where you have to figure out puzzles. It isn't too difficult though.I have played the third game in the series and I have to say this one is just completely better story wise. Uncharted 3's mufti-player is very good though.If you haven't gotten into the Uncharted series! Do it! You will thank yourself for doing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006603W7Q","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Brady","summary":"Great portable baseball sim","reviewText":"This is one of the best games on the Vita thus far. It is rich with content and capabilities, and plays almost identically to the PS3 version. I bought both, and I like the PS3 version better, but you would be hard pressed to find issues with this one.The gameplay is solid, and the depth of features are huge. Everything but the newest mode have been ported over. The game runs smoothly and where they had to trim some fat to make it run well on a portable, they did so in minor presentation details.The graphics are good, but I'm a little disappointed considering how the PS3 version turned out. When my roommate walked in to the room last night when I was playing it, he thought it was a real game I was watching. It looks that good. On the Vita it's solid, but lacks a lot of the detail to really wow you. FIFA on the Vita wowed me. Uncharted wowed me. I know games are much more than the graphics they have, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Minor gripe.Overall it's a fantastic game. An absolute must for baseball fans with the Vita. The cross save integration is great, and works well between season and road to the show. If you have a PS3 and Vita I would suggest it. It's pretty cool. I just wish you could switch on exhibitions. I would highly suggest anyone that likes baseball to consider getting this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Les Paul \"Foolio\"","summary":"Fanfreakingtastic","reviewText":"Though I have never played a Resident Evil game I give this version a big thumbs up. Obviously the graphics aren't going to be outstanding, but they really end up looking pretty darn good. The controls are really good. However the camera angle can get a little squirrelly on occasion. The price is right. Buy it today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Reinventing Evil","reviewText":"In January of 2005, Resident Evil 4 hit the scene.  Since it's release it has already gone on to be labeled as one of the greatest games of all time.  It redefined not only Resident Evil, but the action genre as a whole.  The game was originally meant to be a Gamecube exclusive, but found its way to the PS2 later in October 2005.  It then had another release on the PC.  Now it comes to the Wii.  If you've got a Wii and you for some reason haven't played Resident Evil 4, then this is probably the best version yet.In case you don't know the story, Resident Evil 4 follows Leon S. Kennedy, a former RPD police officer trying to forget the horrors of Raccoon City.  He now works as an agent for the President.  The President's daughter has been kidnapped, and it's up to Leon to rescue her.  Yet when he arrives to the location there's something weird about the locals.  Leon will quickly discover that there are indeed things much worse than being mauled by zombies.Most gamers are aware of Resident Evil 4's greatness, but it never hurts to go through it again.  Resident Evil 4 sports some of the best gameplay in the entire series.  Instead of a fixed camera, it follows Leon around and you see things from over his shoulder.  This means Resident Evil 4 was the first Resident Evil to go fully 3D and it works out just fine.  The environments are fantastic looking, with even the tiniest things given details.  Even two years later, the game still looks absolutely fantastic.  There are even some XBOX360 games that don't give this kind of attention to detail.  There are no frame rate issues and no horrific load times.  Best of all, the game remains a good challenge.When it comes to the Gameplay of Resident Evil 4, however, the Wii is a completely different experience.  At first it was hard not to be a little nervous about the controls.  Just about every game ported to the Wii has had control issues.  Surprisingly, Resident Evil 4 does not.  The Wii controls are excellent.  Nearly flawless.  You'll use the nunchuck to run around, and the Wii remote serves as your gun.  In the interactive cutscenes, you'll use the wii remote and nunchuck to do things like dodge when the game says dodge.  Or when the game tells you you'll need to cut the rope after the first boss for instance, you'll use the wii remote to cut the rope.  At first you might think these Wii Controls are all tacked on, but in the end it makes Resident Evil 4 a completely different experience altogether, and once you get adjusted to them, you'll wonder how you ever did without them.  Even if you've played through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, you might want to give the Wii version a shot just because of the controls alone.If I had any real criticism regarding the control scheme, it would be that Leon doesn't turn automatically when you aim the remote to the far left or far right of the screen (like how the main character turns in Red Steel).  Instead you have to turn him using the nunchuck.  There will be plenty of moments where you'll take damage unfairly.  Even worse, you may get confused if games like Red Steel have you used to that sort of thing.  This can also make some boss battles harder than they have to be.  Clearly Capcom was aware that the controls would take a moment to get used to as bosses are not nearly as tough as they were in the other versions of the game.  Anyone who mastered the Gamecube or PS2 version will find the Wii version to be fairly easy.  In fact, it even feels as though the difficulty has been taken down a notch.If the Wii Remote controls aren't working for you or you want to play the traditional way, the game supports the Classic Controller, and that's just cool if you want other options.The Wii version has no additional extras, however.  This may disappoint a few gamers.  It includes all the extras of the PS2 version at least, but it's a little disappointing that aside from the Wii Controls, Capcom didn't put in any other extras exclusive to the Wii version at all.The game sounds about the same as it did on the Gamecube.  In terms of the technological aspects of the game, it's a direct port here.  All the voice acting and dialog is the same, and it still sounds good.The only really major problem with Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition is simple: It's another port.  The controls here work well, though, but it's the fact that this is the fourth time the game has been released.  In all honesty how any people haven't played the game yet that want to?  Even with the fantastic Wii controls and affordable price it's going to be hard to tell those who own the Gamecube or PS2 versions to get this one.  Even if the Wii Controls make the game a completely different experience, it's still the same game that was released in 2005.Pros:+Fantastic Gameplay+Pretty good storyline overall+Good voice acting' music and sound effects+The game still looks incredible+All the Playstation 2 extras are here+A flawless port, no framerate issues or load time issues whatsoever+The Wii Controls are almost flawless+The classic controller is available for those who don't want to use the Wii Remote and NunchuckCons:-No Wii Exclusive extras-The game is slightly easier-It's the fourth version of Resident Evil 4.  If you've already got the PS2 or Gamecube version of the game you'll have to ask yourself if the Wii controls really justify another buy.  It's a completely different experience, but what it really boils down to is that it is STILL the same game you got back in 2005.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"mugirl113","summary":"Borderlands is an awesome game","reviewText":"I played Borderlands the first time back in late 2009 and loved it then, but put it down because me and my friends got hooked on Modern Warfare 2.  About a month ago we all 3 bought Borderlands GOTY edition and have had such a blast playing again!! Its such a cool concept and we are all anxiously awaiting Borderlands 2!The graphics took a little bit to get used too because we weren't quite sure what to think when we first turned it on, but after a short period of time you realize that the graphics suite the game perfectly!There are a ton of guns in the game, but honestly they are mostly very similar guns with just very minor attribute differences.  Still very cool having so many options at your disposal.My only real con for the game is that I wish there was a hardcore mode or something where all enemies where 1-2 levels ahead of you.  Once you progress a bit the enemies start becoming a bit too easy.  The second play through fixes that a bit though and things start off challenging again.I can't say enough about this game.  One of the best I've played on PS3 hands down!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Daniel Roskeland","summary":"Been a fan since the beginning and Its probably the best.","reviewText":"Ever since the trading card game came out, I've been a huge pokemon fan. As a kid I would spend hours, sometimes days, scrounging up the change just to get those 1$ pack of 11 cards so I could battle with my brother. It was a huge part of mine and my brothers childhood. I had soo many memories with it.. I remember ruby and sapphire, that game was amazing! Just like it's predecessor gold and silver. I LOVED em. It was the perfect escape from reality.. to adventure.Buuuuut my love for it kind of faded out after i played the 3rd installment. I started growing up into a little teen dude who just cared about his hair and girls and blahblahblahhhh.. so I completely forgot about pokemon after ruby and sapphire! I missed two whole generations.. And being now that i'm adult that doesn't nearly have as much free time as I did when I was a child... I could't just pick up where I left off, sadly. Diamond and pearl, and black and white are gonna have to wait until I hit a big break.. or until i retire! I just don't have the time to play both of those and X and Y..But I decided to jump back into the pokemon scene a couple weeks ago and go with Pokemon Y! I ordered the 3DS XL console, a case, headphones, and screen protectors ALLL for this one game (and a link between worlds, but thats a different review) And all i have to say is that my return to the pokemon world has been SO FREAKING MAJESTICAL.I never thought that me a 20 - year old adult male could feel so young and adventurous just by holding a piece of technology.The game is just all around amazing, It's the PERFECT pokemon game to get if you've been away for a while.. Or if the previous two generations just didn't appeal to you for whatever reason. The 3D graphics is something I never even would have dreamed of happening as a child. And now that it's happened... I couldn't be more amazed. It really submerges you into the world of pokemon and it's vast greatness. The mystery of the pokemon and their regions is another thing I really enjoyed as a kid that I also felt in this game.. They always find out new legends and things pokemon have done along side trainers in the past... but they never know for sure what really happened.. or why! So that sense of mystery is still there and is greatly appreciated, as it plants wonder in the players head.I don't wanna spoil anything though. Just know that this game is BIG, and it will definitely make you smile. Especially if you haven't been interested in Pokemon recently. I got chills at various parts just playing this game! I have NEVER had a game do that to me before. Do yourself a favor and save up for this. It really is an amazing game. I don't regret spending 250$ for this experience.10/10.
