{"product_name":"B002I08WVY","description":"","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Stay Away!!! No, but really...","reviewText":"I've never really understood the term \"cash grab\" that many use these days when describing a game. Now I think I finally get it having experienced just that. Thank you Namco for releasing this terrible port to a new console...not. Here's my impression of Tales Of The Abyss and reasons why you may want to pass on this one.Likes:-Gameplay. Mostly the battle system. Being a tales game after all and so this is always the strong point in most these games. There's lots of different skills to learn and many different special attacks to unleash in battle.-Graphics. Which are actually fairly decent.-Smooth controls.-Nice voice acting. Think the guy who voices Vash in Trigun plays a character also the voice actor who plays Monzo The Saw in Samurai Champloo is in this too.-New game plus feature that with lots of unlockables to transfer over exp, money, and items along with helpful combat boosts. Also there's more than one difficulty adding challenge to seasoned players after game completion.Ok. Now here is where the scales tip.Dislikes:-Lets start with the 3d. This is basically non existent and if it is (I couldn't tell). It's bad. I don' t use the 3d feature when playing, but for those who do prepare for disappointment.-Awful story. About two hours in everything stops making sense and as well as the main objective. The game will start sending you to location after location without ever providing a logical reason for going there in the first place. And upon completing that objective you're still in the dark about what's happening only to be sent to some other non sensible location. Overall let's just say it's a complete mess.-Terrible character cast. I've never hated a main character (Luke) this much before in my whole gaming life. This one makes Jar Jar Binks look awesome in comparison.-Profanity to the max. So much even adults will sigh with distaste. Just an example: Luke the main character drops the words d@$n and h&*l at least 20 times each in the first 4 hours of gamplay. I highly recommend not letting kids play this game from that alone. Even an adult will get fed up with this as Lukes dialogue has profanity every other sentence. One more reason to hate him all the more as a main character.-Linear and Lack of sidequests. I know this is not Skyrim, but come on. Put something in to distract me from the garbage storyline. There's no town quests, hidden treasures to be found, nothing of the sorts until towards the end of the game. Boring...-No voiced dialogue outside of cut scenes. This is a personal dislike because all newer Tales games have voiced dialogue outside of cut scenes.-Lack of npc's and presence in towns. Walking into a major city and only seeing 5 people just standing around is pretty lame and lazy on the developers part. Plus there's no exploration to the cities or side quests which makes it worse.-Frame rate issues. Mainly on the world map. Never experienced this before in a Tales game. Which shows how much Namco didn't care about this port.-No extra content. I haven't played the PS2 version, but to release a port with no extra incentive for players who completed the original is wrong. Tricking people into paying for the same game with a new crappy 3d feature is basically what's happened here. I can't believe Namco would stoop this low. Then click over to the new Tales Of Symphonia HD collection coming soon and Bam! Extra content along with enhanced graphics. Seriously this game has \"cash grab\" written all over it.Please. If you simply must have a Tales game on your 3ds don't pay any more than 10 bucks for this stinker. You'll pat yourself on the back later. Otherwise just skip this game. You wont be missing anything and you'll have money for something else more worth while.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2014"}

Everything keeps to the Zelda name but the innovations pretty much make this a whole new game.Those innovations are mainly found in the motion controls.  Since this game is made specifically for the wii pretty much everything you do in the game is motion based and it is awesome!  The controls are the best you will find.  Every action you do is translated with exactness on the screen.  This really highlights the fun of the combat in the game.  Right off the bat you will be slicing and dicing with no problems whatsoever.  Enemies are a lot more intelligent in this game.  They block depending on which side they think you'll strike so you are always having to use a bit of strategy rather than just going in swinging wildly.  Also, this is pretty much the hardest zelda I have played. It's very challenging so if you were a bit disappointed with the easiness of the last couple of games then you will be in for a nice surprise here.  I say that mostly for the bosses.  They are incredibly fun to fight but very challenging.The graphics are the best you will see on the wii I think.  Unfortunately I was playing on my 40 inch tv so when the graphics had to compensate for that they became a bit blurry and not sharp at all.  I was a bit disappointed at that.  Fortunately I watched my friend play it on a smaller screen and the game looks amazing.  I guess I will wait for the true hd wii coming out soon.The story is also the best in the series.  It is still pretty simple but there are a lot of cool additions to the cutscenes that make it a bit deeper.  There are a few other things but I wouldn't be able to explain very well.  You just need to see it.There were a few things that didn't make me hate or even dislike the game but there were just a few things that I wished would have been a bit different.One of those things is that the darker side of the other games in the zelda series is almost completely absent in this one.  Im not saying that we need a teen zelda game, but in the past zelda games there was always something a little more for the older kids.  Something to make the story more exciting for them.  The whole story is pretty cutesy throughout.  Like I said, I didn't hate it but I would have liked it a bit different.Also, in the game there are only 3 different areas where you will be playing in, not including the sky area(which acts as the hub of the world).  New locations in each of these areas do open up as you progress through the story.  Even though these new locations changed the areas pretty dramatically I still missed the variety of the different temples in past games.  Im not a big back-tracking fan so this is something that affected me a little bit throughout the story.  It probably won't affect others though.  That's pretty much all I can say that disappointed me about skyward sword.  Everything else I extremely enjoyed.  Its one of the best games you can play this year and definitely  the best game you can play on the wii.  I would recommend this game to any wii owner.Now to the bundle really quick.  You get a soundtrack for the game and also a special edition zelda wii remote with the wii motion plus built in.  If you like the music in the games then you will enjoy the soundtrack.  The remote is awesome and is up there with the standards of the nintendo products.  It is a really good value so i would recommend buying the bundle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"B. Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"Quite a sleeper for a game....","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge is one of the more unique games I have played and I will express this in three parts: Gameplay, Story, and Graphics.Gameplay: This game is in the first person, meaning you play through Faith's (the main character) eyes. However this is more prominently a parkour type of game where you must from point A to point B by using your environment. Objects you can interact with turn red, which lets you know where to go. The controls are a bit different from most, (Instead of A/X to jump dependent on which console you use, its the LB/L1 button for example) but a couple of runs through the tutorial should help you get it down. You can disarm enemies and use their weapons, but I advise against using weapons because you have a tiny reticle in the center of your screen and no ammo count display. Disarming and incapacitating enemies is perhaps the only way to get through encounters that I have found because I have not been able to just be able to run away most of the time. Overall, the game is more like a puzzle game of how/where to get where your going and to do so taking as little damage as possible. (4/5)Story: Honestly, this game really lacks here. You play as Faith, a 23 year old Runner (a courier of sorts). Between each mission, you witness a cutscene. These provide a very skeletal structure: Wrong place, wrong time. Framed. Got to clear your name. Bring those who did so to justice. That's it. You don't really get that about much about your environment either unless you read press clippings scrolling up a screen when you're in an elevator, and trust me, that is not often. Either to complement this or to the detriment of it, this game is SHORT. There are nine missions, not counting the prolouge, so you can get through this game in at LEAST 8-10 hours. You could get as much enjoyment from the musical score (which is great but for the purposes of this review, I won't get into). Overall, the story could have used more work. Much more. (2/5)Graphics: If I had to choose the brightest spot for this game, its the graphics. The entire experience is just stunning to look at. The environments are very detailed in your immediate vicinity but not so much the farther out you look. As referenced earlier, when you progress, you must come into contact with objects that turn red, which means to jump or climb to continue. This in my opinion is a nice new way to incorporate the level into gameplay that I had not previously seen. Overall: This is just a lovely game to look at and I expect no less from DICE and EA (You Battlefield buffs know what I'm talking about!). (5/5)In conclusion: This is actually a solid game even if the story isn't all that flushed out. Hopefully the sequel on the NEXT generation of consoles addresses this. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for something unique. (7/10)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best games to hit the DS yet","reviewText":"A direct sequel to the Gamecube's Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, the eagerly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is finally here on the DS, and its one of the best games to hit Nintendo's dual screened portable yet.  Phantom Hourglass picks up right where Wind Waker left off, with Link and Tetra (Zelda) sailing the seas.  Naturally, things don't go quite well as a ghost ship appears, Tetra takes off, and Link is washed ashore on an island.  Despite the familiar storyline, Phantom Hourglass has all the fun puzzle and adventure elements that fans of the series have come to expect.  Making inventive use of the touch screen and stylus controls, Phantom Hourglass may take some getting used to in this department, but once you do, you'll have a blast.  Since this is a direct sequel to Wind Waker, the game follows the same graphical and gameplay styles, meaning the cartoonish, diminuitive Link that we came to love (and in the case of a good amount of players, hated) is here, as are the sailing elements.  Fortunately, some improvements have been made for the DS, particularly the sailing parts which are performed much better here.  Graphically, Phantom Hourglass boasts some of the best visuals of any DS game.  The boss battles are wonderful, and the environments are inventive as well, rounding out another masterpiece in the Legend of Zelda series.  The only real downside to Phantom Hourglass is that the touch screen controls, as I've said before, take a bit of getting used to.  Gamers may be turned off by not using the traditional control scheme we've come to expect from a portable Zelda game, but once you get past that, it's smooth sailing (literally).  Not to mention that if the differently designed art style from Wind Waker wasn't your cup of tea, Phantom Hourglass' visuals won't win you over.  All that aside, Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is a smashing title for the DS and the franchise, and undoubtedly one of the best games to hit the system yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Flmarlinsrule \"Marlinsfan13\"","summary":"One of the best systems ever made","reviewText":"This is Nintendo at its best.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"Very good game for anyone who can appreciate RPGs.","reviewText":"The game runs along the story of you, a grey warden, trying to stop the darkspawn from what I assume is their goal of world domination. From the very beginning, I could tell that there was some effort put into this game. You get to choose your gender first. Next you choose between an elf, human, or a dwarf. From there you start your origin story. You can be a dwarven noble or commoner, a city elf or a dalish elf or an elven mage, or a human noble or human mage. The origin stories do this game a great deal of good as they immediately suck you into your character's life. No matter what story you choose, you are eventually drafted into the Grey Wardens, an elite group of people who are the only ones who stand between the world and the darkspawn threat. As the game goes on you must get the three races to ally with you to take down the archdemon's horde and save the world. This is not up to you alone, though. You gather a party from people you meet in your adventures. There is you classic comedic relief character as well as the brooding \"No one understands me\" mage type. Traveling with them is entertaining as they randomly talk to eachother, so be sure to take people with contrasting veiws on the world with you. As the game goes on, you see that you have the classic Bioware love interest option, though it has a severely limiting draw factor. These \"romance\" scenes look like the classic high school nervously fumbling around crap that we had the fortune to forget about. As far as RPG's go, this one is pretty far up on my list. Decent combat, relatable characters, and a pretty good story all line up to give you a fairly nice experience. Im pretty sure I've done enough sucking up to bioware now, so let me get to the draw backs of this game. First off, the graphics were fairly disappointing. I realise that the 360 is not a graphics wizard, but these graphics were not even close to what the console can pull off. Next, I want to talk about the map set up. In an RPG, free roam never hurts. One of the things I loved about the fallout universe is that I could waste my time roaming the wastes. You dont get that in this game. Point to a hotzone on the map and you get fast traveled there. Kind of makes it hard to get sucked into the story. All in all I have to give this game a fairly high score seeing as I spent nearly 100 hours playing it before I even felt the slightest hint of my attention being lost. Given that amount of play time, I can even forgive the fact that you are a voiceless walking stiff. Gotta love Bioware, no?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

A friend of mine came over to my house and brought Silent Hill and the Playstation.  I was just watching and I really liked how it had snow falling out in the town in the summer nonetheless, it looked like a really scary game.  Then, months later, I borrowed this game from my friend and played from the beginning and didn't get really far because I really didn't know what to do.  Finally, one night, when my friend was back over at my house, I was playing and he was sitting there watching and we were playing with surround sound, the lights off and no one else was in the house.  From the very beginning alley, I was very scared!  So I get to the school, Midwich Elementary School, and everything looks normal.  My friend who was watching kept telling me that once I go through the Clock Tower, I will be back at Midwich Elementary and that it will be the same school but at the same time, it wouldn't be the same school and at that point, I was really starting to freak out.  I had no idea what horrors were waiting for me!I go through the Clock Tower and I hear these really creepy sirens, I'm to the point where I want to turn the game off but my friend was with me and kept telling me to move on.  So I start to go into the school and once I'm in, I'm freaking out!  All the floors were replaced by metal grates with nothing below them, the walls were like chained fences, everything covered in blood, pure horror and terror!!  I was really scared by the visuals and the music.  Something really creepy in the Alternate school is when you go into one of the bathroom's on the first floor, you end up on the second floor, creepy!!!  Just everything that I saw and heard in every room and corridor scared me to death!!I turned the game off after I was done in the school and couldn't sleep with the light off!!  I did eventually play through the whole game and beat it but I have never been so scared playing a video game in my entire life!!!  The really scary music and sound effects play a big part.  But what's really scary isn't just the atmosphere, the music or visuals.  It freaks me out thinking about why the town of Silent Hill is deserted and how Samael came along.  If I think about this stuff before I go to sleep, a lot of times, I can't sleep.  The Alternate Hospital, Alchemilla Hospital is another really scary place in the game that really scared me too but not as bad as the school.  To be honest, when I first was going through the Alternate school, the way it looked, that's what I thought hell would look like, it was so scary.  To this day, it scares me!  Sometimes even with the light on, it's scary!!  Even though the graphics aren't the best, this Silent Hill game scares me more than Silent Hill's 2, 3 or 4 and they have better graphics!!!  I would not recommend this game to anyone who scares easily!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

This review is basically of what my opinions were with the system's lifespan.The System itself:4 controllers slots for those wild parties you throw at your house. Memory cards did get better as time passed. Gameboy Player add on is an important accecory for Gameboy fans out there. the GCGBA cable was nice for some games but not that great. Controllers had a nice look to them. Joystick on one thumb on the upper left of the controller and on yellow one for mainly camera control and a d-pad for switching weapons, spells, etc. The buttons were a little bit oddly shaped but once you play the games on it for so long, you can be used to it.Games:The Gamecube had a great selection of games. the launch titles weren't good, but as the time went by, we had gotten better titles. the best games selection was from 2001- 2005. after that the system had suffered a line of children's games, meaning it will suffer like what happened the the PSone. RPGs weren't very popular on the GC, due to the fact that those companies thinking it wouldn't sell too greatly on the GC. FPS on Gamecube were awesome. with the controller's design, you don't have to reach any farther for the L stick unlike the PS2. not all games were not to be on the GC and those would be the Dragonball Z Budokai 1 and 2, because you have to keep turning the sticks and doing so ended up with a broken controller. THe Joysticks on the controller shouldn't go through rough play. The Animal Crossing game was a great example of why people who had too much time on their hands because it goes in real time and you can do all sorts of fun stuff. Graphics for some of the games were excellent as well. because this system uses an ATI Video Card, the water effects are georgus. the system had a great collection of retro game classic collections (mainly from sega and Capcom) Zelda the wind waker is the game to have for this system because it's a long adventure in the seas.Overall:the shinist moment is when Metroid Prime came out and it started to do great. Then as time went on a bunch of games were still good and Once Resident Evil 4 came out, it started to go downhill as companies want to make games for the other 2 systems because of A. use less discs and B. those systems are more popular than GC.Now is the time for the top 20 best and must have games list:1.

It is now July 2013, and I got the solid red ring of death!  Do you believe this???Well, I do.  Microsoft's Xbox is NOTORIOUS for having hardware failures and other problems, and this time, I fell victim to it all.  I don't abuse my system at all (never dropped the controller, banged the system, or played for extremely long hours).  As I was playing Bioshock Infinite, I noticed that my system was making these weird clicking noises with subtle long, intermittent beeping occurring.  Then I couldn't autosave anything during the game. I managed to finish the game while the clicks and beeps were going on, but after I shut the system off and restarted, RED RING!  This system should NOT have failed in less than 2 years of owning it!  I've had my PS3 since February 2010, and that system has not failed me whatsoever.I will NEVER, EVER buy anything XBox-related ever again.

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Great arcade racer","reviewText":"Pros:- Great replay value- Intense racing experience- Brilliant online execution- Constant patching is a huge plusCons:- Only 8 racing designations- Map layout could use some work- Races become insanely difficultGameplay:At its core, Burnout Paradise is a traditional arcade racing game. You can expect to drive your car at insanely fast speeds, launch off dozens of jumps, and crash frequently. However, from there the similarities quickly vanish. Burnout Paradise is one of the first racing games to feature a fully rendered sandbox environment. From the start you are allowed to drive up to any of the games many intersections and hold down both the throttle and brake buttons simultaneously to enter one of the several events that the game offers. There is a traditional race mode, a stunt mode, several crash related modes as well as an individual race designated to every car. Unfortunately, the crash related modes become boring quite quickly, and only the racing and trick modes really remain enjoyable.The sandbox environment and intersection concept are very interesting, but unfortunately contain flaws. First off, it is impossible to retry the race without driving back to the starting location which leads to frustration. Secondly, since all races end at one of the 8 corners of the map, you'll find yourself driving on a few of the roads in every race, and will almost never see more than half of the map. Also, many of the turns on the map are very difficult to navigate, especially when you factor in that you'll be driving upward of 200mph with boost on, and there is lots of traffic. However, the game is still very enjoyable and the presentation is very commendable.Controls:Inputs in Burnout Paradise are very responsive and each car has a completely unique feel. Some of the heavier cars are very slow to turn, but are also very durable. However, some of the faster cars with low durability contain some of the best controls of any cars in any racing game to date. Racing is as simple as using R2 to accelerate and L2 to brake/reverse, but learning to drift around corners takes some practice. With that said, the controls in Burnout Paradise are great and are right where they need to be.Graphics:Although the game features a very expansive map, the graphics haven't been compromised. Burnout Paradise is a very pretty looking game, and the car models are very well-done. The shading and filters used give the game a very next-generation look and each of the main areas of the game have a unique design to them. The most impressive thing about the visuals is that at times you will be driving at nearly 250mph and the game is able to keep the framerate and visuals without degradation.Sound:The game features pretty standard sound effects but each of the dozens of cars has their own engine sounds. The soundtrack for Burnout Paradise doesn't have any big hits, but there are over 90 tracks ranging from opera to songs from the previous Burnout games. The announcer is very repetitive to listen to but the detailed sound effects more than make up for it.Replay Value:Burnout Paradise features hundreds of intersections each with their own race which can take upward of 20 hours to complete. There are also 400 yellow gates which typically lead to shortcuts as well as 50 super jumps and 120 red billboards to collect. To top that off, the online mode is a blast to play. The online mode includes all of the single-player event modes as well as many challenges to complete cooperatively in groups of between 2-8. Most importantly, Burnout Paradise has easily had more content added post-release than any other game on the market, and has received not only free patches which add to the game's already flourishing replay value, but there are also plenty of released and soon to be released downloadable content which require small fees to download. Couple that with the nearly 100-trophies available and you have yourself one of the longest lasting racing games on the market.Rating:Story: N/AGameplay: 9.0Graphics: 8.5Controls: 9.0Sound: 8.5Replay Value: 9.5Overall: 9.0Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: So far this is the best arcade racing game this generation. Not only is it a very well-polished game but the constant addition of content and the already existing addictive gameplay make it well worth the admission.Last Thoughts:Burnout Paradise is one of the first great tastes of what the new-generation of racers have to offer. For such a budget price, there is no reason for anybody who likes racing games to not own Burnout Paradise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

I like the additional \"second chance\" grabs lifted from GOD OF WAR, and the interactive cinematics. In fact, I wish there were more of them. Every time I see an action cinematic I want to participate.The puzzle solving is just tricky enough, and searching for the \"gold rewards\" on each level is -really- hard... but fun.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"GOD OF WAR LITE","reviewText":"Though this game is certainly fun to play, it's in a guilty-pleasure type of way, partly because it's so blatantly a sub-standard and shameless knockoff of the infinitely better God Of War series.THE GOOD : Honestly, not very much. Like I just said, it IS fun to play - undoubtedly. But that's not because it's fun in its' own right. It's fun because of what it's trying to be. It does have the `curiosity factor' going for it, in that it's interesting to see how Hell is depicted and that right there is probably the game's biggest strong point. Hell (especially the first few levels), is a fascinatingly rendered place, and contains many interesting (albeit disgusting at times) things to look at. The monsters / demons / tortured souls are all appropriately twisted and vile and fit right in..... until you get to about level 5 or so (more on that in the next section). Admittedly, the game does also have something going for it in that it's fun to brutally smash these demons, devils and other hellish creatures to a pulp. One of the other things I did enjoy about the game is that if you're a PS3 trophy hunter, this baby's an eeeeeeasy Platinum trophy. As long as you're diligent about the collectibles etc., you can play this game on easy mode and you only need to get the `offline' trophies (about 84% completion) to get the Platinum. The online trophies are not required for the Platinum. I wish more games got this point. I don't like having to rely on other players to get the trophies I'm after (IE, AvP, Resistance 2, etc.). Especially because I wouldn't want to waste any more time than necessary on this game. Not that it's THAT bad - it's not. It's just there are so many better games I could be playing, I'm all for doing a run through or two and moving on. I suppose there's a few other things I'm not thinking of right now, that I liked, but if you're really interested in the game, I'll leave it up to you to find them.THE BAD : Plenty. There is absolutely NO getting around the comparisons to the God Of War series because it's such a shameless rip-off of it. If I understand correctly, this game was designed by the original designer or creator of God Of War. And if that is correct, it gets an extra demerit point for a lack of originality and creativity. I mean seriously. It also gets another demerit for taking a literary classic and absolutely mangling it to the point where very little remains intact from the original source material. Virgil is still a guide through the trip and the levels of Hell are what they are in the poem, but that's about it. Everything else would probably be considered an affront to literary types. Beyond the two most obvious things I've already mentioned (and could continue to expound on), the most glaring weakness with Dante's Inferno is that, as I mentioned in the previous section of my review, the demons, devils, etc. make every bit of sense through the first 4 or 5 levels or so, but after that, they significantly lose their consistency. What I mean by that is, I understand why lust demons appear in lust and gluttons appear in gluttony and greed devils appear in greed......but why are these same manifestations rather prevalent throughout Violence, Fraud, Treachery, etc. Did the creative team just give up on trying to design villains that would make more sense for the level they appear on? Sure felt like it. Additionally, the levels of Hell themselves didn't seem all that engaging after about the same point. It's like the will to be creative just got sucked out of the development team after about half-way through. And now I hear rumor that they're planning a sequel? I shudder to think how bland that might be considering the startling lack of effort displayed in the games' second half. All in all, it was a very uneven effort. As one last item of (un)interest, it should be noted that those easily offended by all things disgusting or sexual perversion should steer well clear of this game. With gluttons vomiting corrosive bile on you, lust demons peeling apart their labias and lashing out at you with their extended wombs, Hell being decked out in phallic or vaginal shapes in areas, and even Satan himself sporting a rather noticeable phallus, this game has plenty to offend in it. Be forewarned.THE VERDICT : Though it does have its' moments and can definitely be fun at times, Dante's Inferno is a  shameless and unapologetic rip-off to the God Of War series. This game is best left to the Xbox crowd, as it offers a glimpse into what God Of War is all about in terms of combat style, combos, magic, items, etc. If you own a PS3, as I do, don't make the mistake of buying this (as I did - though I got it for a third of the price on eBay, which certainly softens the blow ;-) - just rent it if you're really that curious. Otherwise stick to the God Of War series and you just can't go wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2010"}

The game that proves the mettle of the DS. This is the first full-fledged adventure for the system, the first game that doesn't rely on the DS' unique features to be great. In putting Superstar Saga's sequel on the new handheld, Nintendo has made it even better.The gameplay you know and love (admit it) from the first game is perfectly intact. Only better. Now you control four brothers instead of just two, and it makes the sweet, sweet puzzles all the sweeter. Most of the moves you'll learn are all-new, and they challenge your brain in unique ways. Plus, the great battle system now makes you think even more; careful observation and quick reflexes are greatly rewarded. Another great addition to combat is the \"Bros. Items\". Far from a useless gimmick, they're absolutely essential, and fun to boot.The dual screen really adds a lot to the game. A map now appears on the top screen during gameplay, cutscenes can now show two perspectives at once, and creative boss battles and puzzles require you to quickly glance back and forth between top and bottom. The touch screen is used a grand total of one time, but that doesn't matter.I enjoyed the fun plot from the first game, but this one is in some ways even better! I found it a lot funnier than the first--the babies of Peach, Mario, Luigi and Bowser are hilarious, and the dual Toadsworths' dialogue had me in stitches. The text dialogue is wonderful, but perhaps even better are the scenes conveyed entirely through action and limited voice-acting.I do have a couple complaints--the game's a bit short, and bosses seem to have way too much HP. But if you loved the first game, there is no excuse not to buy this, and if you haven't played the first, buy that and then get this. This is an incredible adventure for everyone to love.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2005"}

Let me explain. You should never lose your experience points in any game. Souls could of been used for everything else in the game, but you should never lose your ability to level up. They could of made it so if your not using weapons at your current level or above than it would give you penalties on your skills based on the level of the equipment you're using, and they could of made anything you have to buy very expensive with souls as currency. It just makes me think that the makers of DS didn't want to do that much math. I'm only on level 24, and it's taking over 3000 souls just to level up my character. Imagine when you're level 200. It's just a dumb idea, especially when you're stuck killing the same 10 enemies over and over again in the same small area just to get strong enough to even be able to attempt beating a boss.

Most of the reviews that have been coming out for this game seem to spend most of their time talking about how similar this game is to other games. I am not really sure about the relevance of this. This game is excellent.First off, I want to say that I am pretty tired of reviews saying they just started playing the game. If you have not finished the game(or got so frustrated or bored that you gave up on the game) you have no right to leave your opinion. Funny that most of the reviews are from people who played the game an hour or two!!.It took me about 23 hours to finish this game and I did not explore every nook and cranny of this massive game world. I spent full price for this title and really felt like I got a great deal. The graphics are top notch. The puzzle designs are very complex and obviously a lot of thought went into them. With the exception of the last level with the three robots you have to fight(not kidding--yes there are robots to fight. Why three of the same robot??) I enjoyed every minute of this game.Checkpoints are well spaced and if you die in a platforming part, you are placed on the last place you were without having to restart at checkpoint. They did make this a bit more challenging then something like Prince of Persia though as you lose a piece of your life bar every time you die. I have never seen something like this done before in a game.The fights and especially the bosses are very epic. Nearly every boss--with the exception of the last boss and the spider boss, are really puzzles which need to be solved rather than a big thing with a huge health bar that you have to beat down. Most of the bosses can be defeated in less than 5 minutes once you know how but the fun is figuring out the method behind it. The only negatives I have are that the frame rate slowed down from time to time and there were some cheap opponents in this game--that spinning flying thing for one, that acid spitting creature for another.The load times on this game are nonexistent--literally, you never see a load screen except when you start the game. Loads are done during cutscenes. Why don't all developers do that?? The best part is the fact that this game ends with an obvious hint that there will be a Darksiders 2. Can I preorder this now????BTW, I am no ashamed to say I am a hardcore PS gamer.

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Eagle Vision","summary":"Game system that has come a long way since I started in the 1980s","reviewText":"This is an excellent gaming, entertainment, and social media type of system.  First of all, memory is expandable to some degree.  This allows downloading of digital media such as music, movies and games.  The registration process is seamless and once your credit information is in the system, you can download digital content rather easily.  Web browsing is facilitated through a good browser, and there are applications for specific sites, such as YouTube and Facebook.  An on-screen keyboard is responsive but accuracy can be improved.  This is useful for checking news and email but heavy duty browsing is better left for laptops, smartphones and tablets.  Browsing speed is very respectable considering the type of system this happens to run.  The operating system is remarkably stable.  Parental controls give the individual to restrict use for younger users.The controls are quite comfortable to use, and it even allows control from the back panel on some games.  Ergonomics are solid.  Graphics are quite robust, though not in High Definition.  Sound quality is respectable from a small system but headphones give a more in-depth experience.  Navigation along the menu system is intuitive, allowing button or touch screen control.  The system is intuitive and self explanatory.Game selection has been, for a lack of a better term, pretty sparse; however, new games are coming out in the upcoming 2012 Christmas season.  Options for downloading games are the same as the carts.  Prices are a bit higher when you factor in the cost of expandable memory and the lack of heavy discounts of used games - the plus is the added convenience of downloading on the go.The front and back cameras are a nice added touch, and integration of the user's images are incorporated into certain games, such as Madden 2013.  Too bad there is not a camera option, or the option to upload photos on social networks.Battery life is average for a color screen of this size - roughly 4 hours with WIFI on and brightness around 75%.Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase of this game system.  It has come a long way since the days of Pong and the Atari 2600 by severalfold.  Even middle aged people, like me, can be entertained.  Though disappointing in the volume and breadth of games in the original release, the games are starting to become more plentiful with a decent variety.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

You run around as a guy named Dash, you start with a laser, but you can find missiles, proton thingies, stun guns and my favorite that just blows half the room away, I dunno what it was called but it's great...oh, and a flame thrower!!! Would have been nice if the enemies caught fire or something, instead of act like the where shot, but it's still cool.Half the game is on foot in a Goldeneye/Duke Nukem kind of way. You open doors, collect things, can fly around with a jet pack, and have to do things to get to certain area first before moving on the level and things like that. The rest of the game is flying and shooting in your ships.Level one is the battle of Hoth, and where this games story begins. It is almost like the Battle Of Hoth in RS on one of the bonus missions. The graphics aren't RS, but that didn't matter. You gun down the probe droids, go after the Chicken Walkers, and then trip the Walkers. Then the story begins, what's happening is this game starts from Empire Strikes Back (the movie) and after the Battle Of Hoth, it's following the story of another Rebellion, Dash. And what it leads to is the events that have happened in between Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi.From the movies, you only see the end of Empire as they go looking for Han, then the next movies starts with his rescue. Well this game is what happened in between then.The graphics are decent, there not RS but it's still fun. I know it's the original, but it felt good to actually get out of the crafts and vehicles and do some running around for a change.Only 3 negative things I have to say.1) You kill Boba Fett in this, so that makes no continuity sense.2) No multiplayer :( would've made a great 2 or more player game I reckon.3) it would have been nice to be able to do a custom edit to the controls, and be able to choose what button you want to do what with. Because of the 100's of other shoot' em up games; every time I went to shoot I was pressing the Z button by mistake. There's no programmed control setting to use the Z button to fire. Which makes no sense, because the Z button is known as the trigger button, but all it does in this game is either view, or run left, depending on what control setting you have set.So, basically, the graphics aren't superb, it was one of the 1st games for the 64, and you can see the many advancements they made for RS. But this game is still good. SOFE & RS are 2 completely different games. If you love RS or BFN, and you haven't played this one 'cause you think it is inferior, then think again. It holds its own and stands up still. There is even a level on speeder bikes! Reminded me a bit of Racer, but not quite the same; it's hard to go fast and stay in control in this. There aren't any ships to choose in mission like RS, basically you start with the Snow Speeder, go onto Dash's ship that is much like the Falcon. And apparently there's a code to fly an X wing in the last level, and cheats to play as the AT-ST, but I didn't try them.I found it tougher then you'd think to stay alive, so I recommend you enter the Debug code.What you do is start a new game in a fresh slot, (erase if you none free) then enter your name as \".Wampa..Stompa\" and note the case sensitive, and the . before and in the middle of the words. There is a space at the start, and 2 between Stompa. It is case sensitive, so make sure you press the L button to change from upper case to lower case. Then ok it all and start the game. Press pause as soon as the level starts, and on the pause menu, hold down all the c buttons, the L, R, & Z buttons and left on the arrow pad (hold them all at once together. Then while holding them down, move the control stick to the left for about 5 seconds, you will hear a noise. Then hold it right for 5 seconds. Then left, then right, then left for the same time. And you should get pink writing come up.(TIP: the way I did it was used my finger to hold the button, then used my lips to hold the stick left and right)That pink writing you can toggle through by press L or R, and then Start to enable it. You basically just need the invincibility and all weapons. Maybe the level skip or teleport (to another location of the level your on). Have fun with it. Each time you want to use it again, hold all the buttons down again (all C's, L, R, Z, left) and then tap the analog to the left and the menu will display again whenever you want it.May the Schwartz be with you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2005"}

The graphics and overall gameplay controls look and work the same as they do on the PS3/Xbox 360 but again like with SC the WiiU gamepad does offer a few added bonuses like easy access to equipment and switching weapons or items  and a bigger and more accessible map.Load time is a little longer then the PS3 version but not as long as it was like with the Splinter Cell game but again somewhat expected as the WiiU version installed about 60MB instead of the 6GB the PS3 version did.Also you won't get some of the extra SP missions you got on the PS3 but that's pretty much the only big difference between the two really.  So if you have a WiiU  this game is a pretty good one to add to your WiiU game library and for those who already have it for the PS3 or Xbox 360 I say while it's double dipping for a game you already have for the price it's worth getting.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Beautiful action-adventure experience","reviewText":"Pros:- Visually breathtaking- Class-A voice-acting- Great gameplay variety- Interesting story- Fun to playCons:- Platforming is too easy- A bit on the short side- No co-opGameplay:Uncharted: Drakes Fortune is a third-person action adventure shooter set in an environment very similar to the Indiana Jones films. The main character, Drake, is a treasure hunter who goes on an expedition near the Amazon in search of treasure. On the road through the game, you will meet several very endearing characters such as Elena Fisher, the female protagonist and Eddy Raja, a very selfish treasure hunter who plays as an antagonist. The game features typical third-person shooter gameplay as well as one of the best cover systems we've seen. In essence, the game really feels like Tomb Raider meets Gears of War, but it really is a game of its own.One of the most unforgettable gameplay elements of Uncharted are the platforming scenarios. Throughout the game, there will be obstacles which you will have to climb onto, as well as ropes to swing from and much more. The platforming is without a doubt some of the best platforming seen to date and feels polished to the brim. To top off the platforming and cover systems, there are also a few points in the game where you have the opportunity to try something new, such as riding a Jet-Ski. These several moments in the game really give the game variety and make the presentation that much better.Controls:Naughty Dog is known for making very polished action-adventure titles, and Uncharted is no different. Every element of the game feels right and whether you're shooting from behind stone cover or climbing a 100-foot wall, everything feels and looks genuine. The cover system features both a pop-and-shoot mechanic as well as the ability to fire while staying behind the cover at the expense of accuracy. Both feel great and help make the long and challenging fighting sequences fun and enjoyable rather than an annoying obstacle. My only gripe is that the platforming elements of the game are too forgiving and provide very little challenge, if any.Graphics:Screenshots don't do Uncharted justice. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is without a doubt the best-looking console game to date, and is remarkable in every way possible. The colors and vibrance of the dense tropical jungle environments are only surpassed to Crysis for the PC. The textures throughout the game are highly detailed and really help shape the mood for the chapter. The water in Uncharted is some of the best you'll ever see, and seeing Drake get out of the water and soaked in the areas that were submerged is simply incredible. Not to mention that the character models and animations are remarkably detailed and help give life to the story. Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment for Uncharted graphically is just how much it does for the platforming. The platforming in Uncharted is as simple as jumping from object to object, but the animation and visuals make it look so real that it's almost hard to believe you're playing a game at times.Sound:To start off, the voice acting is some of the best I've heard. Nolan North did a terrific job of giving life to the main character, Drake. Just about every character in the game is voiced by an established voice-actor and each do a great job of giving personality to these video game characters. The sound-effects are really fitting and really help make you feel like you're in a deep jungle. Also, the music is brilliant and there are tracks for just about every moment throughout the journey. The main theme is easily one of my favorites of all time and together with the sound effects and voice-acting, really helps make the presentation come to life.Replay Value:Uncharted is a pretty short game and is usually beaten between 9-12 hours on the first run through. However, I can't remember the last time I played a game that was enjoyable 100% of the time. This game really does a good job of entertaining you the whole way through, and while short, every second of every minute is fun. Also, Uncharted has dozens of unlockables which are earned through in-game achievements. These unlockables range from costumes to videos and visual filters. Along with the challenge of Playstation Network trophies and the Crushing difficulty mode, the game has a fair amount of replay value.Rating:Story: 8.5Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 10.0Controls: 9.5Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 8.0Overall: 9.0Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: What the game lacks in length it more than makes up for in pound-for-pound entertainment. The sheer quality of the game is deserving of purchase, and the overall experience is simply unforgettable.Last Thoughts:Uncharted is simply a breathtaking game that really shows us how far heavy polish for a game goes. Every facet of the game is high in quality and the addition of unlockables really helps give the game the replay value it needs. Get it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

I have tried playing other games with her but the experience was not as enjoyable as it was with this game.My GF isnt as much as a game player as me. We have played games in the past (Time Crisis 3, Eye of Judgment, Lemmings, Calling All Cars) and none of these games held her interest enough for us to continue playing.THIS GAME, however, made her eyes light up and made her laugh as she enjoyed every moment playing the game. The controls were simple enough for her to get, and simple enough to make the hardest thing within grasp. We played and laughed all night as she was amazed how cute the game was.The game itself is a great game. The level of cuteness this game holds is off the scale, and practically anyone can pick up this game and know how to play it within 20 minutes.The amount of detail put into this game is also insane. They have everything from little facial expressions, to the ability to make youre little sackboy to dance and move around his hips. You can change and customize your sackboy to your liking. Then theres the stages which also have tons of detail, and customizable feature.Beyond the problems, online play is great. Just like the normal game but with more people to play with. The amount of created stages online is awesome too. Each stage has so much detail to them you would swear they were part of the game development. I recently played a Batman Arkum Asylum Stage that was probably better than the first stage of the game. This is proof that the game can basically only can get better.The only downside i see to the game is that it can get old. But how often have we played side scrollers and they have not gotten old yet. the first 5 Mario games were side scollers, and the first 4 sonic games were all side scrollers, and people continues with those games for years. With downloadable content, online play, Co-op play, and creation/customization the game has, this game is going to be around for years, and its going to be fun and exciting for a long time.I recommend this game for anyone wanting to have 'child-like' fun with anyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Where do I get pants that regenerate?","reviewText":"When I heard that X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a good game, I wondered if it was a joke. A good game based on a mediocre movie? No way. But I went and bought the game, and low and behold, I was having a blast within the first 5 minutes. No other game has made me feel as awesome as Wolverine. THIS is how Wolverine's other games should've been. No limits on using claws, no toned down violence, no melodramatic plots, just straight up action. The funny thing is that I normally don't like violent games, but this one's just so over the top that it sucked me in.The story? I didn't pay much attention to it to tell you the truth. You play between the present day story and one from 3 years earlier- Wolverine in the jungle while on a military operation. A lot of it has to do with revenge on his brother Victor Creed, and superior William Stryker. The game's all about action though, and chances are that you won't care for the plot anyway. Wolverine goes from location to location tearing everyone a new one, and taking on some major X-Men characters along the way.The number of ways Wolverine kills his enemies is impressive. The first one that really got me was when he lunged to a helicopter, smashed through the glass, then pulled the pilot out and held him up so the helicopter blades decapitated him, and created a huge red swirl. My jaw dropped when I saw that since I didn't see it coming. In fact, I replayed that scene 4 times just to do it again- it's that cool. Enemies also get dismembered in different ways depending on how you slash them. Wolverine can also use objects in the environment to quickly dispatch them as well, like wooden spikes, mini-cement mixers, forklifts and more. You have three main attacks- light slash, heavy slash and throw, and then 4 special attacks as well that can be used when you build your Rage meter up. Wolverine also has a great Lunge ability where you lock on to an enemy, and as long as the view isn't blocked or they're not too far/high, he'll leap toward them and you can go from there with how you want to attack. The Lunge is awesome, and I loved that there'd be certain parts where the camera would switch to right in front of the enemy so you'd see Wolverine pop up behind them. Comedic gold right there. Also, Wolverine's healing factor and Feral Sense are here. You heal after a few seconds, as long as you're not getting attacked, and this helps gameplay so you're not constantly looking for health packs. Pressing up on the d-pad changes the visuals and highlights key locations and points you out on where to go next, kind of like the guide feature in Dead Space.So why the average rating? I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, but since I couldn't I rounded down due to some of the problems. First- the boss fights aren't that fun, at all. These guys take forever to whittle down, even the first boss which later appears as more of a mini-boss. I found myself getting bored. One that really got me was the boss in chapter 4 where I had to restart the battle NINE TIMES because it'd constantly glitch on me, and he'd either disappear from the level completely, or he'd get stuck on part of the platform and freeze, not taking any damage no matter how I attacked. So I had to be very careful with how I fought him just to try and prevent glitches. That part nearly made me quit on the game. Lastly, gameplay gets really repetitive by level 3. Since Wolverine doesn't have a lot of different combos, most attacks look the same and all of them are equally effective.Visually, the game's a mixed bag. When the camera zooms in on character models, they either look good, or like an early-ps2 game. Cutscenes looked phenomenal though. And you gotta love how they show Wolverine's injuries in-game while he heals. Watching him run around with a hole blasted through his chest was just plain cool. The voice acting's all good too- no complaints here.While I did have fun playing the game at first, 20+ hours is a long time to be doing a lot of the same attacks and fun-deprived boss fights. This was definitely a great effort on the developer's part, and the game deserves the good scores it's gotten, but the glitches (especially in that boss fight) kept me from wanting to play through it again. Definitely get this though if you want a non-stop action game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2010"}

Of those that I don't are NFS Most Wanted, Assassin's Creed Liberation, F1 2012, Dungeon Hunter and Resistance Burning Skies.There are however some great classics on PSN store that you may like, like Metal Slug Anthology, Twisted Metal 1, 2, Fighting Force etc.As for the console being white I can tell you it looks gorgeous compared to the black version. It doesn't show fingerprints as bad and looks like a fashion accessory although sometimes it can become distracting due to the contrast of the white body combined with the black screen. I wish more consoles came in white not just expensive limited edition bundles like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"What a game!!!","reviewText":"I recently bought Binary Domain for the 360, and to be honest, I really haven't kept up with Sega in the 7th gen nor have I heard anything about this game. I accidentally stumbled upon this game whilst looking up gaming videos on YT.This game reminded me of Sega's Vanquish title except with the inclusion of NPC talking and an excellent story. The story in this game is absolutely fantastic and ranks amongst the very best. Here's my review-Graphics-In the beginning of BD, the graphics were just so-so to me for some reason. Although I loved the way the first level was a fallen city to set the mood, upon closer inspection, it just didn't look too good. The first act includes some creative use of level design but it still wasn't giving me much. Everything came together from the second act on in my honest opinion. Although BD is reminiscent of Vanquish, the grpahics in Vanquish were really good as I remember and at times they were epic with the inclusions of huge bosses.BD uses huge bosses too, but Vanquish had gigantic bosses in comparison.One thing I really liked were the cutscenes; and some of them are brutal and violent; including a man ripping the skin off his face to reveal he's a &#34;Hollow child&#34; (aka Cybernetic humanoid)The character's faces look fantastic and the in game models are imaginative, at least in the case of the humans. However, the many robots you'll fight are simply a horde of clones sporting only minor differences with color being the main difference.Binary Domain is a good looking game but sort of pales in comparison to Sega's other 7th gen offerings such as the ever hard Sonic Unleashed, Vanquish, Alpha Protocol and perhaps Viking.Sound-The sound is good. The music is forgettable. The dialogue itself is incredible. I really loved listening to the cutscenes and in game dialog.Gameplay-Binary Domain takes place in the future and is about the U.S government's ongoing political and hushed war against &#34;Hollow Children&#34;  which are cybernetic beings created in the likeness of humans. In fact, their likeness isn't the only uncanny thing about them. These hollow children can become pregnant, cry, feel emotion, pain and such which makes them extremely hard to differentiate from humans.In comes your character, Dan Marshall, who's sent on a mission to eliminate hollows and capture Amada, the creator of Hollow children.The game begins in a casual way but easily progresses to a story that rivals games like &#34;Enslaved&#34;. The story also changes depending on who you pick or who you're more familiar with. I won't spoil the story; but it is excellent in every sense.The gameplay boils down to a third person shooter with some melee tossed in. It almost uses the same engine that Vanquish used just without the slowdown function and more melee without having to worry about a suit overheating. It also uses a &#34;down but not out&#34; system that's similar to Gears of War 2/3. Your team can revive you or you can revive them. In the meantime, you can shoot from a downed position.There were also a few gameplay notes worth noting like the fact that if a downed robot crawled and grabbed your leg, you had to shoot them to get them off you or hit them. I just thought that was a nice touch.There's an upgrade system for weapons and perks. Also, during conversations, depending on what you say will affect your stats or your team stats. This can be confusing at times being that some responses for questions have nothing to do with what's said. This game also uses voice support; so you can literally talk to your team mates or answer questions with your voice. Personally, I didn't test it out and don't intend to.I'm not sure how long the game took to beat but I got done with it playing it over the course of 3 days. It has a good amount of length to it and the best part is how the story will change based on who you choose which adds replayability.I highly, highly, highly, recommend getting this game being that it's a really good game with an excellent story, impressive visuals and a creative TPS engine. This is a must get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZBP6","description":"","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"Something new but then again just more of the same.","reviewText":"I put off reviewing World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria because I wanted to thoroughly play the game first. Wait for the \"It's new give it time\" people to fizzle out and the game to progress naturally. Now without any excuses you can truly see just how good this game is or isn't.I will say that I'm not going to go into a reminiscing of the older days of WoW,I'm not going to talk about how outdated the game looks, I'm not going to talk about lacking the population is or any of that. I'm just going to talk about the game.My first impressions of MOP was a new class but is it even worth it this late in the games life? Well for starters lets just get the concept of WoW. With each new expansion (excluding WOTLK)there's usually a new race/class to try that you start off with from Level 1. As always with each expansion there are 5-10 levels you need to reach to achieve the games new top level before you even matter to anyone and can join in on the other \"fun\" such as raiding,pvp etc. etc. Now with MOP the new level cap is 90! and you start off with a Pandarian at level 1. Now lets give that a thought. From levels 1-90 you have to re-experience all the game content you've been playing through for the past 6-7 years. After you clear the new starting ares of course, it's back to kill this and collect that been there done that. That might be okay for those fondly in love with the game but for others it gets tiring and repetitive.The new class has new abilities, they look very interesting but that's the most I can say before I lost interest in the game as I was leveling. The game world as it is now in WoW just isn't a fun atmosphere to play in. Most of the games MMO mentality has changed into SPO (Single Player Online). Most people just quest alone in empty zones. Chat is nothing more than a messaging system to break through the mundanes of the game.  The later expansions like WOTLK,Cataclysm,and MOP all tried to add something new to revive the game like interactive quests,altering the old world,new zones, better storyline, etc. etc. but the problem is that it's not new enough and the experience is short lived.It's like a fresh new idea mixed in with an old idea. So while one part of the game might be new or fun everything surrounding it is old and tiresome and unfortunately if you plan on getting anywhere in the game you will have to go through the old and tiresome as well. The thing I always felt about wow expansions is that they are short lived. You don't explore a new world or universe from level 1-max. You just explore a small area for 5-10 levels or so and it's not enough to really impact the game.The Burning Crusade did well because it was an entirely new universe to explore that was huge and full of new areas and content to explore. Everything else since than has just seemed like just an island or zone.MOP is no exception to that. You only acknowledge the expansion when you have a reason to be in Pandaria or see a Pandarian in town. Other than that it's just a far off place that doesn't effect the rest of the game until you have a reason to go there.Pandaria from what I experienced so far is the same Warcraft quality that they put into the starting zones. You Start out with a sense of RPG by following a story line and learning your character and after level 20 all that is forgotten.  But, to be 100% honest when I played the Pandarian starter questline I was more reminded of Guild Wars Factions. It's hard to ignore the entire Temple and Asian culture them when Guild Wars Factions is an entire Game Expansion from level 1-Max with a complete new world and story to follow centered around Asian culture. That was the first time I saw something like that adapted into an MMOish styled game and that was about 5 years ago. MOP didn't blow me away because of that reason and I wasn't impressed with it because of that reason. It is as always charming in the way of Warcraft's cartoonish style. It's fun but very limited when you leave Pandaria to venture out into the world to quests in the zones that you are already tired to death of.Since this is also a part of the game I will review it as well, and that's the current status of the games culture. Like Warcraft has always been it's a game about keeping up with Jones. Having this achieving that, etc. etc. is all this game is about.  There are Many new mounts, achievements, random weapons and armor etc. etc. to keep people that enjoy that aspect of the game quite pleased. If you like collected and leveling up characters there is now more stuff than ever implemented into the game. If you are not the type of person to chase the dangling carrot there isn't much in the game to offer outside of a fun gaming social experience. The unfortunate part is that Guilds used to be the foundation of the game social experience but now that are more meaningless than ever since guild achievements were introduced. Now you can expect to have random people spam invite you into their guild with 500-900+ people for the sake of earning points,money, and achievements alone. The rewards and perks have cheapened the guild experience substantially. You will actually have to \"work\" to find a true guild or start your own. Just be aware that now Guilds are ranked and having a low rank might turn off people from joining (isn't that nice).Additional changes after MOP also include Talent and Skill class changes for the 1,141,241,434,934th time. This time the skill sets are stretched out. Some of your favorites have been re arranged so you access certain skills you received sooner much later. You can also customize your skills a bit more by choosing skills that were role specific. There is more customization now to skill sets but, That also means you will have to pay each time you wish to fool around with them.I just note that money is important to have in this game as you'll need it for armor repairs,changing your skill sets etc. etc. Having money is no problem for people who live in the game 24/7 but if your a casual player or someone coming back after a long time it will be a problem until you divulge the same time into the game farming money. Despite the fact that this is an MMO I dislike the idea of a game feeling like \"work\". Blizzard looks to improve the game to make it more fun and more accessible but still throws in their pitfalls. There is no casual way to play the game. It eats time and it is indeed a time waster. Nothing in the game is programmed to be achieved without wasting it, and that's truly what the game feels like now. WoW:MOP feels like a new waste of time. It's just an extension on the games already thinning hour glass.It's 10% new and 90% old. If you have the time to spend releveling characters,farming for gold and items, or continuing to chase the carrot on the stick than you won't see MOP as a problem. If you have however matured in your preference of MMO's from just collecting weapons and armor to actually wanting an engaging story line and plot than you might want to try something else. At this point in WoW's history it's cards are on the table. It's as good as it's going to get and it will always be what it is. You'll either love it if this is why you play WoW, or hate it if you were already tired of doing the same redundant tasks.Overall WOW:MOP is a 2/5 game. Not nearly new enough to be impressed by it.Also, I forgot to talk about the new end level content of the MOP expansion. More dailies and more quest to get items like mounts. That's pretty much it. The game has changed a lot almost completely from the way it was 6-7 years ago in regards to how you level,quest, and build your character. It's been made to be a lot more simplistic and there isn't anything technical about the game anymore.You spend time doing quest,doing rated BG's,or raiding through the now convenient \"dungeon finder\". If you have the time to spend you will do well in the game that is all that it requires at this point. It's made so anyone child or adult can play it. That's not necessarily a problem if you're looking for a simple and light game to get into. It's one of the reasons Warcraft was so successful but it's a turnoff for those looking for something more challenging.Guildwars the original is what I left WoW for some years ago as my man MMO/online RPG experience. I left because it was a more technical game with a heavy focus on story/PVE. Guildwars 2 which is what I play now has the PVE but I also noticed that it's more simplistic than the previous version in how you level and build your character. I suppose that is the current trend for MMO's now.Beyond doing what you've been doing the new MOP expansion doesn't add anything outside of what you're already familiar with when it comes down to WoW. It's just now in a more simpler form. The best part of the current game are the \"merged\" realms where zones are now like BG's where you play along side people from other servers. It makes the game feel full again in certain areas and that is nice, dungeon finder is also on the same level.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

There are 20 missions, tons of weapons, great music, and again, some VERY intense gameplay.Gameplay: I can't say it enough--suspense and intensity!  The game is designed to be played in whatever way you choose.  You can go in with guns blazing (which works much of the time, depending on the difficulty setting) or you can lurk in the shadows, behind corners, and within a variety of disguises.  The game encourages you to use stealth and rewards you for being strategic and limiting \"collateral\" damage.  Most missions will allow you to take out your target without harming anyone else.  However, there are a few missions in which you'll have to send more than one person to the morgue.  Much of the gameplay boils down to surveillance, getting disguises, staying away from guards (and most civilians), dragging and hiding bodies, finding and disposing of your target(s), and escaping.  The real fun comes with choosing a strategy for the job and all of the tension created when you're sneaking around and trying to avoid being discovered.  The only quirks I experienced with gameplay was the oversensitivity of the guards on a few occasions.  Otherwise, this is a very entertaining game.  It lasted me about 40 hours on expert (medium) difficulty.Visual: Very well-done.  The weapons look and act realistic, and the settings (St. Petersburg, Malaysia, Nuristan, India, Japan, and Sicily) are all attractive and convincing, with weather effects, region-appropriate language, and great architecture.  The graphics are not state-of-the-art, but they are still quite good and create immersive atmospheres.Sounds: The soundtrack by Jesper Kyd is probably the best I have heard in a game.  It is orchestral, but fits the atmosphere of the game very appropriately.  It also adds tension at the right times and does give you the sense that you are doing your deeds in faraway places and different cultures.  The voice-acting is good, and people talk in the appropriate languages.  All weapons sound as they should.  Even the sound of the footsteps of your assassin are determined by whatever terrain he is walking/running on.Replay value: I definitely intend to play this one again, since there is more than one way to complete the missions.  Also, the more strategic and secretive you are, the higher your rating and rewards.All together, Hitman 2 is an excellent game for anyone who likes stealth missions and intense gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2004"}

Well, its' concept is this..A young woman named Lin has discovered she is heir to the throne of Rikea. You are her guardian and advisor, as she fights across hostile lands to build an army and battle for her rightful place at the throne. You're a general who controls an army of troops as it moves across the land fighting other small armies in melee combat. You control dozens of soldiers, as well as magical wizards. You control magic and collect items & equipment that will help you defeat the opposition.  While those, like me, who've played Advance Wars will compare this game to that one in that it is turn-based tactical strategy on a grid map- it is a completely different game in that, instead of a whole troop fights at once,  you fight an enemy alone with swords and lances and magic. It's typical turn-based fare, assuredly, but with a twist. The twist being that, if an individual dies during a battle, they're gone for good. However, specific characters are important to the storyline, so when they die- they don't really perish so much as they retreat. They hang out with the armies of people ready to do battle. When characters reach certain skill levels, they can advance to other classes thus making their presence more known on the battlefield. While the game is a blast to play, I was more brought into the storyline. The story itself has really strong character development and that's what I like in my RPGs.All in all, I loved the game. I hadn't finished it yet, mind you, but I will. It's hard to put this game down as many reviewers here will tell you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Nintendo DS, Refined","reviewText":"Nintendo has had a long-standing history of making great systems, but perhaps the area they have the most reach in is the market of handhelds. Up until this past decade, Nintendo has had a quasi-monopoly on the market for portable gaming devices, and even when faced with competition, they end up on top without a scratch. Aside from the Virtual Boy mishap of the late 90's, they have never faltered when it comes to putting out amazing hand consoles. And so, it is with great relief that I say that Nintendo has done it again with the 3DS, delivering what could arguably be the greatest handheld system to date.Functionality: A-Putting a home console experience on a handheld is no small feat. The PSP, as much as I love the system, came close but missed the mark in many ways. Those ways included lack of comfortable analogue control, loading times that are laughable at times, and game slowdown. The 3DS improves on all three of these things, and much more. The analogue control feels tight and comfortable, your thumb nestled snugly into a tiny crevice on the control stick. As far as loading times and slowdown? Well, with the game I tested (\"Samurai Warriors Chronicles\"), the load times were minimal, and the game never slowed down with dozens of sprites on-screen. Considering that this game has vast landscapes, and that the enemy count on the screen often tops 50-60, this is an incredibly impressive feat for a handheld. Comfortable to hold and fun to play, functionality is one of this system's strong suits. The only questionable design choices are the odd placing of the stylus (upper left-hand side of the system, opposite from where your hands would intuitively be), and the loose-ish hinges supporting the top half of the system. Minor gripes, but they may bother some.Graphics/Rendering Capabilities: A+There were times when, in the midst of gameplay, I was fooled into thinking that the game I was playing belonged on the Wii. While the Wii by no means has the best graphics on the console market, it means a lot when a handheld has THAT MUCH rendering power. Even the third-party game I was playing felt expertly designed. I can only imagine how beautiful the first party Nintendo games are going to look. I DID notice a slight decrease in smoothness when I turned the 3D effects up to max, but it wasn't crippling by any means.Sound: A+Sounds and music create the effect of surround sound. Well, maybe that's an exaggeration, but it's no joke that this little thing has some of the best speakers on any portable device. It feels as if you're being pulled right into the action with every precisely-buffered sound effect, and every little bit of the mp3-quality score is heard without lagging or noticeable compression.As for the 3D: B+Does the 3D work? Yes, and for the most part, it DOES add an extra bit to the games I played (the aforementioned \"Samurai Warriors\" and a store display of \"Pilotwings Resort\".) There are times when enemies were appearing over a vista in SW, and it felt like I was looking at them from a great distance as opposed to simply seeing them on a static screen. It adds an extra layer of depth, in my opinion. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, it's not necessary. In the least. I'll admit, it's fun to play in 3D without glasses, and does do something no other console can, but it won't be a system-selling feature. The quality of graphics, functionality, and library of eclectic titles will draw most to this console, as well as Nintendo's track record of great handhelds. So, it works great, and is fun to use, but isn't necessary to enjoy gameplay.Games: A+Yes, the launch library is scant, although I do like most of the titles offered (except for the sports and pet simulations, although those do have an admittedly vast audience.) But take one look at the planned games for this year and the next, and you'll realize that this may be the best-planned release schedule of a Nintendo console yet. We have Zelda, Metal Gear and Mario Kart this year for the big-name appeal. For niche game fans like myself, we have Shin Megami Tensei, Dead or Alive, and Dynasty Warriors. Not to mention Kid Icarus: Uprising, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Star Fox... the list goes on. For the first time in my 17 years of life, I genuinely feel like Nintendo has nailed a modern-day launch.Overall: A+This is, as said before, perhaps the best handheld console to date. Even excluding things such as the AR games and cameras (I didn't feel like that would be relevant to most people who were buying this), this is a phenomenally-designed system. It's easy to pick and use, and with upcoming system updates, we're going to get downloadable games, an internet browser and other goodies. For those on the fence about whether or not this is worth getting, jump down and make the purchase. It's one you won't regret.NOTE: I noticed a complaint about the battery life of the system, and I will admit that it's relatively short (a little over three hours with full 3D effects and max brightness.) HOWEVER, most people with common sense would realize that playing with max brightness on ANY piece of hardware will kill it's battery, and that using 3D effects on the go isn't really that healthy when you're about to do something. Tinkering with the settings will extend it's battery life for over five hours, which is more than sufficient for most trips. Nintendo also remedied the issue somewhat by including a battery-saving mode, as well as a charge pad that juices your system up in an incredibly small period of time. No big deal for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

They've encountered ghosts, and fought them with the character's supernatural antique camera.  They laugh, and claim this game isn't scary.  Perhaps the camera is the reason.  After all, it is your only weapon.  But while they may call it stypid, I call innovative.  This game redefines the survival-horror genre.  And I don't care if my frineds don't understand it.  They've never played it alone in the dark, with the volume turned up.  They haven't looked around a room they knew was empty only to find the ghost of a disfigured man suspended upside down from the ceiling, staring silently.I will admit, at first I was skeptical that this game wouldn't prove to be as great as the Resident Evil series because of it's 'Teen' rating.  I've never been more wrong.  This game scares silly the way the Sixth Sense managed to creep you out despite it's PG-13 rating.It's fun, the cinemas are great, the graphics are wonderful, the sound is good, and it is scary as hell.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2003"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)","summary":"Entertaining But Somewhat Different Sonic Game","reviewText":"While the game describes itself as being different from the other previous Sonic games with the exception of about 30% it does play as the usual Sonic game but that's not to say it's a bad thing just not as different from the previous games as much as you'd think.

I'm a huge Spider-Man fan and if you're like me, all of the game's hiccups really gravitate a game that many will call sorta mediocre. With cameos like Luke Cage and Wolverine and the inclusion of putting the web slinger back in black, all I can say is this is fan service of the highest order. Is it a great game? Not quite but this is the best Spider-Man game in ages, my personel favorite next to the old Play Station game.The developers put Spider-Man in the GTA sandbox gameplay again and here it's done much better than in the previous movie games. The side missions are still a bit repetitive but it's kinda cool saving citizens from harm and fighting several different styles of enemies when the city explodes with bedlam. Best of all, no red balloons!Swinging around the city is really fun this time and the game is much bigger than Ultimate Spider-Man which was relatively short. The aerial combat is awesome and easily the best part of the game. Here you also get a new spin on things, the combat allows you to mix up combos by switching back and forth with the symbiote and the classic red and blue. Each style of play is unique and feels completely it's own.One problem is the value system which rates your good and bad deeds, save someone, it goes up, throw a car it goes down. The whole thing seemed really innovative but they really could have explored it much more.Some problems are hard to overlook. Some missions have you repeating the same attack over a dozen times which gets really old after a while. The bosses are decent, you go toe to toe with wolverine, venom, and the vulture which is nice but they should have added some more. With all these symbiotes running around, where's carnage? The biggest problem I had with the game is almost a killer though, with all of the increasing chaos going on around the city, the framerate drops to a snails pace which is a real shame considering how pretty everything looks. Towards the end of the game I felt like I was watching a slide show and I'm not exaggerating at all, it nearly make the game almost unplayable.All of that being said, when the game was firing on all cylinders I couldn't help but enjoy myself. The gameplay might be a bit of a button masher but cool moments like teaming up with Moon Knight and fighting Wolverine absorbed by a symbiote are excellent. The voice acting is well done and the story is just as ridiculous as it needs to be. All of the little nuances do so much to save this thing. This here is clearly a game meant for the fans and if you are one, you're in for a real treat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2010"}

It seems like the developer (Gearbox) did not test this function almost at all!Summary:  Avoid this until updates, or buy it for console.  If you intend to buy this game, wait for the price to drop while they update the game until it's actually playable on multiplayer.One of the key features that was advertised (and still is advertised) is the multiplayer.  There are so many things wrong with this that it should not even be advertised.  Let's look at these problems:1. Game freezes at 'Join online game' menu.  You cannot access the list of current online games because of this.Solution: Forward router ports officially supported by the developer's website.2. Connecting to a 'Private game' always times out (player is never able to connect).Solution: Same as solution for problem number 1.3. Games are hosted by players, and no dedicated servers are even possible.  This causes obvious lag which, coupled by the clunky controls, makes multiplayer gameplay insanely difficult to play.Solution: None.  There is no sign that they expect to change this.4. Even if you DO manage to correctly forward router ports and connect to any game, if your game loads into a new area (which happens fairly often), all players except the host are disconnected and the game gets stuck at the loading screen, forcing termination of the program.Solution: ????  ....Wait for patch.Conclusion: Multiplayer is impossible for this game in its current state.  It is possible to connect to a game, but non-host players can't load into new areas.  This is necessary to progress the game, and hence multiplayer is impossible.If you want to discuss purely single-player content... much of it is decent, but it isn't interesting or engaging and is still problematic.The major problem with single player is the clunky controls.  Forget that the menus are not adapted from console to PC (many menus are navigated using the keyboard, and cannot be used with mouse).  The aiming clearly just doesn't work!  Many times I have put my crosshair right on an enemy's body or head and it misses to my amazement.  Not to mention that often when you fire the game loads the bullets being fired or the blood or something like that, causing a slight lag right when you need to be lag-free the most.On story, there simply is just not much.  This advertisements make this game out to offer great exploration and player progression.  Most quests are identical (kill these, collect those, go there), and offer little story value.  The player progression system uses MMO-like skill talent trees.  Most characters have same or similar skills, which do not alter their gameplay style very much.Conclusion: Even the single player, while being playable, does not offer much for gameplay and story.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

I picked up a premium 360 over Easter and it was worth the wait.  The premium is the better value-it comes with a wireless controller (a must for me since I keep the 360 in another room), the hard drive, and component video cables (needed for high-definition).  The core requires at least a memory card so you are only spending about $60 less than the premium.Its a good thing I keep the 360 in another room because its LOUD (but not as loud as my gaming PC).  I have not had any lock-ups or freezing-I keep it horizontal and allow plenty of room around it for ventilation.  The wireless controllers work perfectly (they are about 20 feet away from the console in my setup).  So far I have played Call of Duty 2, Dead or Alive 4, and Tomb Raider Legend and the graphics have rivaled my gaming PC, which I play at XGA resolution.  I should mention that I play on a 106 inch diagonal projection screen so the 360's graphics are much improved over the old Xbox.  For those of you who play on smaller screens or do not have high-definition tvs, the 360 may not be worth getting just yet.  The release of the Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation 3 this fall will likely drive the price of the 360 down so waiting may be prudent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2006"}

I'll give my own account.  I got this for use with my PS4.  I've used them both for playing games and for watching movies and tv shows (netflix via Ps4 and straight blu-rays).  For all these uses they've been terrific.  Certainly the best headset I've owned.  The sound is superb, I find them to be very comfortable (I've worn them for hours at a time and honestly forget that they are even there after awhile).  The range is also impressive.  I've walked into other rooms to get a snack of whatnot and just kept them on and can hear the sound nicely.I haven't honestly given the mic a workout yet, as I haven't played any games that have needed it.  When I speak I can hear my own voice in the headset though, and it sounds ok.The one complaint I have about it is the setup.  Omg.  If some of the reviews are because people haven't set it up properly I can empathize.  If you bought this to use with the PS4, the instructions it comes with are useless, and their website is a disorganized mess or information.  I can honestly say I spent a couple of hours trying to assimilate all the relevant info and get it installed properly.  It's not really that complicated when it comes down to it.  A couple of pages in the manual would have made it clear as mud, it's pathetic that Turtle Beach doesn't bother to do that.  So I take one star away for that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00B3PDHBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Fantastic headset for serious and even not so serious gamers","reviewText":"Make no bones about it, the Turtle Beach XP510 has set the bar quite high. I have very little to complain about in regards to it but even then, this headset gets nothing less than five stars from me.Everything you will possibly need to connect this is included in the box. Connecting it took me not even a minute's time.For starters, they sound absolutely terrific. I tested them out with several different games on my Xbox 360, namely Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 3 and for the most part, Halo 4.The bass response is pretty deep and in terms of directional sound, you'll be able to tell exactly where your foes are coming from and where all the action is happening. They're incredibly clear and you'll be able to hear every single subtle nuance in the game, which is really cool with games like the Dead Space series for instance, which all have phenomenal sound design. Playing Halo 4, I felt like I was able to pinpoint anything and everything and get the jump on people who thought they had me at their mercy. There's even a setting to amplify footsteps, which gives you a big leg up on the competition. There are a whole bunch of different sound fields you can access at the touch of a button that adjust either your general sound settings or your chat settings and finding one that's perfect for you should be a cinch. You can even connect to your computer and download all new sound fields as well for more customization options. All coupled with a pleasant female voice to let you know what settings you're on as you cycle through them.The max volume is simply loud enough. I bring it up because I know several people were concerned about the installed volume limiter but really, any louder would damage your hearing and no game is worth that. I sincerely doubt that anyone will be disappointed by the volume here.Bluetooth connectivity is offered and I mean, think about this: How cool is it that you can play your game and take a phone call with it if someone decides to give you a ring? Seriously, this function, simple as it may be in concept, is awesome. Pairing it to your phone is easy and you'll really appreciate it once you put it in use.I haven't had any snap, crackle and pops with this headset either. The X41's suffered from this but with the XP510, I've had no such issues. The only time it occurred was when my son sat next to me with an iPad running on a Wi-Fi connection to my router and as he was loading up Netflix movies, I would get some interference. Once he moved away however, the interference disappeared altogether.The headset itself is very comfy and this is coming from someone with a big noggin. The build quality is pretty sturdy and it's one of those products where once you actually hold them, you'll know you're holding a quality product. The X41's (and even the X42's) felt somewhat flimsy to me in comparison to these.The only recurring problem I had with the headset was in regards to the Bluetooth adapter that you plug into the controller. When it's connected, it works just fine. It's also pretty cool to have a wireless headset that doesn't require a cable running from the headset to the controller for chat purposes, like the X41's for instance. Once you pair the adapter to the headset via Bluetooth, it's all fine and good. The only problem is, I found myself on many occasions either accidentally disconnecting the adapter from the controller or unwittingly turning it off due to the location of the power button. I felt like the connection on the adapter wasn't really solid and more often than not, I found myself in conversation with no one until I looked down at the adapter and realized that the thing had been shut off or I had unplugged it. The power/pairing button is on the bottom of the adapter and if you happen to say, rest the controller against your leg or your stomach, it's a potential moment for you to turn it off. Thankfully, there is an included cable if you want to hardwire the headset to the controller but it winds up being a minor annoyance.I guess that the learning curve on the headphones should be noted as well. The headset has quite a few buttons on it and it took me a while before I could operate it solely by touch. There are quite a few functions to get used to with the headset so it pays to get familiar with it.I didn't even mention the rechargeable battery. You get quite a bit of juice once you've fully charged these things and it gives you an audio notification to let you know when you're running low. So good to not have to scramble for a fresh pair of batteries when they dry up, let me tell you. The only potential problem with this is that the battery is built into the headset, so a potential shipping to Turtle Beach to get a new battery may be in your future, depending on its life cycle.I genuinely feel that this headset is the absolute best gaming headset I've used yet and I've used a bunch. Please leave a comment if you have any more questions in regards to the product but I'll tell you upfront that they get a full and absolute recommendation from me. My X41's served me well but the XP510's are an absolutely worthy successor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

I find it hard to believe that they didn't DELETE my file since I am no longer buying their product, but alas I now have to spend bucks on security scan software and services to keep Mr. Chinese hacker from buying who knows what in Singapore with my identity.  The real kicker is that they basically said, \"Well, our account management systems have been hacked and all your info was stolen, but to keep you happy we decided to give you an in game bag that gives you 10% bonus on all your money!  Cheers from all of us at Trion!\"  Like I was still buying their crummy product.  I wish I could punch their net security team in the face.  Well, risk you take when you play these games, and alas something to be aware of if you decide to buy this product with their sub standard security systems.I've been a wow player since a few months after launch.  I've found like so many that a few months after CATA launched I was bored stiff with WOW.  So, gave Rift a shot, and here is how I think it stacks up to WOW:- I've leveled only a rogue character currently up to level 33.  Max level on the game is 50 so I still have a ways to go.  I will break down the comparisons to first - class, since you spend by far most of your time in game messing with your toons, second with general gameplay/graphics, etc.  I have a 85 rogue on WOW, one of many toons, and while not my favorite, he is fun to play from time to time.  The comparison between the two can only go so far.  The WOW rogue is essentially the same type of toon in the three talent trees.  You have stealth, and while not as essential for lets say combat as it is for sub, its still a core talent for the class.  The Rift rogue is much different.  You have what is essentially a hunter class (ranger), a ranged specialist (marksman), a wow type rogue (assassin), a semi-ok tank class (riftstalker), a buff class (bard) and a few other dps classes the combine limited stealth or spell like ranged or melee damage abilities (blademaster, saboteur, nightblade).  And yes, after doing a few low level quests you get access to all classes and talent trees.  The fun part of Rift is you can combine any of these classes together (you can mix and match 3) into whatever you want.  And you can put your talent points however you want.  Lots of fun with this - at least for a bit, but after awhile its not really that much different than WOW (i.e. many talents are just filler so you end up taking the +x% dmg talents 90% of the time).  My fav spec was assassin combined with blademaster and nightblade.  I went heavy into assassin because they have permanent stealth and a vanish spell at the top of the tree.  They are not common abilities as with the WOW rogue.  With this, you could stealth past groups of mobs and avoid 99% of the agro grief that alot of ppl qq about (more of that later).  I have two other builds on my toon, one being a marksman/beastmaster (kinda like a marksman hunter in WOW) and a bard.  I believe you can buy more builds, but as of right now I barely use my other two, so I don't see the point.  I also tried the riftstalker tank class, but they seemed kinda gimpy compared to warrior tanks (damage mitigation was meh at best) so I bailed on it and chose bard.  So, in relative detail here I go...Assassin - very similar to your WOW assassin rogue.  Stun, use your dot building moves (yes, its identical to WOW) and use your finisher.  Its fun like the WOW rogue is fun, but its repetitive with the same 3-4 abilities used over and over - which of course is the same as WOW.  The primary pro to this build is perma stealth.  If you don't have this talent which is deep in the assassination tree, you stealth gives out at around 30 seconds.  With the cooldown to re-apply its rather gimpy.  The other talent is vanish, the top talent in the tree, but here is the major issue.  As with WOW, the vanish only works some of the time.  Often you will vanish and the mob(s) will run back to their starting positions, and then run back over and attack you while you are still stealthed.  Kind of buggy, but its similar in a way to the WOW stealth mechanic.  You can be spotted while stealthed and attacked, however you do not have an ability like distract to keep their attention off of you.  There is an ability to increase your stealth level for a few seconds, but it didn't seem to work very often.  In dungeon runs the assassin seemed to work rather well.  The assassin tree has no aoe so you have to get some aoe abilities from other trees you wish to use.  I had 10 points in blademaster which gave me a few abilities to strike 2 - 3 targets and my nightblade had a similar ability at 10 points.  The dungeons mostly boiled down to multimob (use the same dot builder and aoe finisher) to single target (backstab and apply your dot finishers).Marksman / beastmaster - the marksman tree is all about ranged damage.  You still have dot building moves and finisher moves (different from WOW) but you also had hard cast dot builders and finishers that reminded me a great deal of the marksman hunter.  I had 10 points in beastmaster as well which gave you the warthog and the dire wolf as your two pets.  The warthog was a great solo/quest tank pet and the dire wolf was more for non-tanking damage roles.  The marksman tree is built around kiting, since by itself does not give a pet.  The finisher moves in particular can crit for a great deal of damage and the aoe was very good.  I also have a 85 hunter in WOW, and this build is most similar to that class so I will use it for the comparison.  Is it as fun as your WOW hunter?  I did not think so at all.  I have played my hunter a great deal more than my rogue over the years, and one of the mechanics of that class I truly enjoy are the rare pets you can farm and the unique abilities they bring to a group.  With the beastmaster, you get a warthog.  The same warthog everyone has.  Granted, you can name him Fluffffy with five fs if you wanna, but its the same ugly hog that every other BM has in the game.  Can you tame more?  Nope.  And it barely moves.  Your pets in wow have their own animations, stretch, growl, scratch, etc.  These things twitch now and again and thats about it.  They have zero personality.  I played this build in a few dungeon runs and while questing a few times, however its the same 3-4 abilites just at ranged.  I gave up on it mostly because you have no stealth.  In going from place to place in a zone there are mobs everywhere.  Soooo if you wanna kill everything wonderful.  If you are trying to save time and you cannot stealth, you still have to kill everything because they agro off you so easily.  Instead, just pop back into assassination and stealth to the next quest site...Bard - not much here that is similar to WOW.  It is a buff class - i.e. you can buff your other group members or cause your enemies not to fight as well.  Only time I played this is when I tried to get into a group that didn't need another DPS.  It reminded me in a way of a healer, and that isn't my cup of tea.  So I didnt play it much.  Buffs, dots, finishers, etc.Tank (Riftstalker) - This might be a good tank tree when you get the gear, but I tried to tank two five mans at around level 20 and the heals could not keep me up.  I ran the same dungeons with a plate wearing tank and we finished without a problem.  Needless to say I have not run a successful 5 man dungeon yet with a riftstalker tank.  I had no problems maintaining threat, however the build is based around dodge mechanics, and while dodging is great, your going to take damage eventually and I seemed to be getting hit harder than that warrior with his shield and heavy armor.  Musta been that leather...Graphics - Rift looks fantastic, but the zones themselves are not too hot.  There are some that have a great feel, with towering spires and rock formations, however they seem rather lackluster when compared to some of the far out zones in WOW.  Additionally, with all that added detail, it can take a hit on your computer.  I run WOW at ultra settings at high wide screen rez and can only run Rift at high settings.  In the city with lots of other players there is often terrible lag and jumping.  However out in the zones its generally smooth.  While the detail is there, I suppose the fundamental difference between the two games is WOW is cartoony in nature and Rift tries to be more realistic.  WOW has weapons and armor that have odd colors, lightning affects, and have little balls or whatever that zoom around it.  The Rift stuff is much more drab and comparable to what people probably would wear in reality.  So I suppose it just boils down to what you enjoy more.Gameplay- Rift has... RIFTS!! WOOO!! or WOOO! for about a day or two, then its just woo, or maybe a wo.  They are these... rifts that pop out of the air and make a kind of death/life/elemental invasion into the land.  Mobs spawn and you can join public groups (with a click of a button, pretty handy) to beat them.  After awhile, as just about everyone says, its just a zergfest to get phat lewts.  I'll do one if I'm stealthing by and I have time to spare, but otherwise they have pretty much lost their appeal.- UI.  Nothing much different here.  You get your boxes to click, its customizable (you can change the size, how they are arranged, layed out, etc.) and overall very well done.  What is bad about it then?  You cannot get mods - at least that I have been able to find.  You don't have recount.  I know, I know.. isn't that a blessing??  Well, not really.  How do you know if your doing very well?  How do you know if your build is REALLY as good as the last one you were tinkering with?  How do you know if placing 10 more points in one tree to get one ability outperforms one in another?  You don't.  I suppose they did that for a reason, otherwise all the different combos of talent points would boil down to where it is on wow, with everyone built off what EJ says about your class.  And 90% of those talent trees and maybe classes altogether would be relegated to the heap of crappiness.  But part of what you do in the game is try to get better.  Its not just about the gear, its how you play.  And without an essential tool as a DPS analyzer... your kinda SOL as a dps class.- Patching.  This one is pretty bad atm.  They patch pretty regularly, but do some crazy stuff.  Stealth was supposedly bugged when I first started playing, where you could walk right on top of a mob 10 levels higher than you and not pull agro.  So they patched it and made it so you could not sneak up on anything.  Literally destroying the stealth mechanic, except if you were perhaps hunting squirrels.  Then they patched it again a few days later making it so you could sneak up on a mob, but you had to attack quickly or they would see you.  This blew my mind that they would implement something so severe without testing it first.  I don't know what systems they have over at Turion, but they are definitely not as refined as what blizz does with WOW.- Crafting.  Not much new here.  You buy/farm mats and make items, with the possibility of making epix at max level (yes, they are even purple just like WOW).  If you have played a crafter in WOW you have played a crafter in Rift.  They do have a solid auction house as well.- PVP.  I was never a big PVPer, but it seems OK with Rift.  Class balance is quite a bit of QQ from ppl in the city.  I have done a few warfronts, but it seemed to boil down to whomever had the best healers.- Dungeons.  I talked a bit about this earlier.  They seem generally pretty easy, a zergfest AOE marathon with a boss thrown in once in awhile.  Not much different than wrath dungeons a year or so ago.  They have added a dungeon finder - but it is not cross realm and can take hours to find a group.  I waited for over an hour and was grouped with four people that were all in their high 40s.  Needless to say everyone bailed and I had to start from scratch.  Not as well done as the WOW engine.- Community.  I have heard this a lot.  'But people are so sweet and nice in Rift!!' - ???  One of the first Rifts I went to where mobs were spawning and you had to kite them to areas in the Rift to kill them in order to finish.  A few of us didn't understand what had to be done and were killing the spawns away from the designated kill areas.  So ensued the WOW like tells 'ZOMG #$@#$ #@$#!!!'...  I guess the enraged kiddies from WOW tried Rift as well.  I don't really see much difference other than I don't stay in the city much in Rift because of the lag and therefore don't get exposed much to the 'trade' chat.Lastly, I find myself playing more WOW now than I do Rift.  I have heard it said that Rift is like WOW, but more refined.  I prefer to think of it as Rift tries to be like WOW, but didn't quite cut it.  Maybe I will make it to level 50 before my few months of paid time wear out, but I have little interest in the game anymore.  There just doesn't seem to be much there that was done as well as what blizzard has already put on the table.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2011"}

GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"Pretty incredible!","reviewText":"I would rate this game 4 1/2 stars. The single player mission is awesome. Has to be one of the most intense FPS games ever. The graphics were very good, the sound effects were very good, and the gameplay was excellent.Most of the levels in the single player game were short, but very intense. You were fighting the enemy almost every second of the game. There was very little rest. The enemy AI was pretty solid though not as good as some other games before it (i.e Half-Life). Between defending a bridge, taking out attacking airplanes at an airfield, and defending many other positions, this game was a real challenge. It took a few times to fihure out what to do to beat some of the levels, but  was hooked on the game. There is definitely 12-15 hours of game time on the single player mission which is pretty good for an FPS.As for the multiplayer, it is pretty good, but not great. As in the single player mission, you can aim down the sight of your gun which makes you move slower, but aim better. The aim for the weapons is very hard. Moving, you have a very wide area where the shots are gonna spray. It gets better if you quit moving, even better if you are crouched, and even better if you assume the prone position. But because of the bad aim of the SMG, I believe that is why most every game at least half (usually more) of the players use rifles and sniper guns. As for the maps, there isn't anything special about most of them. There 4 or 5 real good maps but there 4 or 5 maps that when they come up, the players either ask for a new map or leave.There is also a considerable amount of lag. I am running this on a P4 2.8ghz, 512 ram, 128meg video (NVIDIA Geforce FX) card, and using DSL, and after I downloaded the patch (I recommend this as there are only about 100 or so servers left you can play on without it), now I can't log into a game. They have Punkbuster and I get in a game and after 1 or 2 minutes, it tells me it can't load some PB file. Not sure what that is (guessing something to do with punkbuster though my game menu tells me I have it loaded), but it has become very frustrating. Still, when you can get on a game, it isn't too bad. There is Death match and Team deathmatch, plus they have a game called Retrieval (which is just like to Return To Castle Wolfemstein), Search &amp; Destroy (which is just like Medal of Honor's objective match), and Behind Enemy Lines. Behind Enemy Lines is where you have a very small team of Allies who are vastly outnumbered and score points by killing the Axis player and staying alive. An Axis player who kills an Allied player then respawns as an Allied player to try to score more points. It pretty cool.There is also an expansion pack coming out sometime around November I beleive, so there will be even more fun on the way. I would recommedn this game to anyone who enjoyed RTCW and MOHAA. You won't be dissappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2004"}

But i know this game will have im sure much more coming, i will keep it near my playstation. All in all i really enjoyed this game. Is it my favorite final fantasy game? No. But I don't think its meant to be. Every final fantasy game should be viewed as unique and different than the rest. And this one is certainly no exception. The story i found to be very captivating, I love the strategy style fighting ( Though i will agree with other people, this game was WAAAY to easy.

I was equally as excited when I heard MW2 was going to be the latest project from Infinity Ward.Campaign mode was a remarkable experience, even if only a single-player option.  However, like its predecessor, multiplayer is where you fall in love.  As someone who loved the \"deadliness\" of MW1, I was disappointed by World @ War.  Gone are the days of unloading half a clip at another player, only to see bullets whizz past his yead.  If you have him/her in your crosshairs on this game, he's DONE.  The new additions to MP admittedly take some getting used to...but if there were never ANY changes, the game would get stale...much like many of the other FPS games on the market.Also, the art design returns to a degree of vivid realism...a stark contrast to the burnt-out, smokey grays, browns, and greens of World at War.  The details seem more crisp, more realistic, and (if you had time to look at them), perhaps even \"beautiful\".The only negative I can think of for this game is the new rules on party chat in certain game modes.  I understand wanting to get everyone on the same team talking to each other, but sometimes I just want to join a friend or two and talk about other stuff (weekend plans, events of the day, etc) without having to put up with the immature comments/inane chatter that many Live users resort to.  Sure, this will certainly be a point of contention with some people loving it and other hating it, but many of us would be glad to see it changed.In short, CoD4 was a masterpiece.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"Plumber Rush","reviewText":"There is no question that when it has came down to the Super Mario Brothers games, they have definitely delivered every single time. Since 1985 when the original Super Mario Brothers debuted, gamers have gone wild for Mario & Luigi unlike any other game in the arcades and at home with the original NES. But with so many games and systems going and trying to do what Nintendo had done, Nintendo hadn't lost its edge. With the Nintendo 3DS, they delivered brilliantly last year with Super Mario 3D Land and reinvented the way Mario took the platform run and jump game brilliantly into 3D. The game definitely showed what Mario was made of like he every time was from start to finish. But through the game, we also saw a few elements that were taken on from Super Mario Brothers 3. Well that is shown again for the Nintendo 3DS. But is New Super Mario Brothers 2 worth the money? Absolutely.New Super Mario Brothers 2, continues the winning formula that made New Super Mario Brothers Wii and the original New Super Mario Brothers showed from the original Nintendo DS well, as Mario is back at it again, trying to rescue Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser. This time, he isn't the one alone again. He has his kids, the Koopa Kids Lemmy, Ludwig, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Larry and Roy with him. They are holding her in the wake of a massive coin crop where there are going to be more coins for Mario to grasp. But with it, the game shows a bigger challenge with new levels of excitement for Mario to explore, and classic enemies again like Renzor from Super Mario World and Dry Bones and Boo. The game takes you on 8 levels of madness and a star world that is just amazing to master. You also do have returning items including the mini-mushroom that makes Mario teeny but he is unable to fight his foes. Still, he can wade on water and leap quicker than the eye, and the might mega-mushroom which makes him king-sized to destroy anything from foes, and break pipes. It is like the invincible star, but also fierce. The game also features a few new power-ups in Mario's aid including the coin block, cap which will turn Mario's head into a coin factory that will keep adding coins and giving you 1-ups while playing. There is aldo the gold flower, which will turn you into Gold mario and Silver Luigi where you can fire at bricks and turn them into coins, and your foes and make them spit out and fire coins at you from Lakitu and the Hammer Brothers.The graphics are definitely worth their effort and stand out well. While the only flaw is the music by taking bits from New Super Mario Brothers Wii and not anything new to spin off of. The control remains as distinctive for you to play with Mario as you run and jump with great ease, and fly with the return of the raccoon leaf from Super Mario Brothers 3, that makes you flutter and fly in spots to grasp hard to reach coins. The fun is definitely great for seasoned Super Mario Brothers veterans as well as newcomers that have never played a Mario game yet. The learning curve might make it too easy for veterans to master at first like Super Mario 3D Land was, but the game is definitely addictive if you want to try and master the Coin Rush mode where you only have one life, to try and grasp as many coins as possible.All in all, there may be some gamers that might be turned off by New Super Mario Brothers 2, and more in wait for the upcoming New Super Mario Brothers U in regards to it being included with the Wii U soon. But I still definitely recommend New Super Mario Brothers 2 for the Nintendo 3DS and the new Nintendo 3DS XL. Not just because it is a great game, it still shows that some games and certain games have never lost their spirit with age. The Super Mario Brothers games have shown that for over 25 years ever since the NES came out. This one is definitely worth its money as a must buy for the Nintendo 3DS.Graphics: ASound: B+Control: AFun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Batman Arkham City is a Hit!","reviewText":"QUICK REVIEW:Definitely buy this game, but I strongly recommend getting the Game of the Year Edition, because you get about $30 worth of DLC included for $10 more than the original price.This game was amazing! It's one of the few that actually lives up to the hype. I'll discuss the different sections of the game in their respective places below:STORY (NO SPOILERS):The story of this game is awesome, and was written by the legendary Paul Dini. It had lots of surprises along the way, and made me think about what was going to happen next. The basic story is that after the failure at Arkham Asylum, a large section of Gotham has been walled-off and made into Arkham City, a giant prison where the criminals can run free through the streets and do as they wish, as long as they don't try to escape. Hugo Strange, the mastermind behind it, has captured Batman and imprisoned him. Throughout the game, you'll be exploring the city and trying to find out what's exactly going on in there. You encounter many classic villains along the way, such as the Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, the Riddler, and Solomon Grundy. Many side missions are available with the main story, and each of them are pretty fun with a few exceptions, with a couple just being tedious. With a new purchase of the game, you'll get a free code to install the Catwoman DLC pack, which is normally $10. I highly recommend installing it before you begin playing, because Catwoman's missions (4 in total) tie in with the main story. I'd say that the main story is about 10-15 hours, depending on how fast you're going and how many side missions you do. Don't worry about all of your progress when the credits start rolling, because you won't lose any of your progress and you will still be able to do all of the side missions. The Riddler is back, and that means that various Riddler trophies will be scattered throughout Arkham City, providing you with a challenge of finding them all. Finding trophies typically unlocks Concept Art, Challenge Maps (more on those later), or 3D Character Models that can all be accessed from the main menu.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay of this game is very fluid, and as a person who hadn't played Arkham Asylum previously, I was able to get going in a few minutes! The controls used during fights are very simple with X and Y being strike and counter, respectively, and the D-Pad and left and right triggers using gadgets. You might think that all this game is is button-mashing (which, admittedly, sometimes is), but as you progress through the game, you'll find yourself planning out how you're going to attack, which gadgets you'll use, and which guys to take out first. The gadgets are very intuitive and actually make you think about when and how to use them! You can also tap LB to activate \"Detective Mode\", where enemies are highlighted in either Blue or Orange (unarmed or armed) and environmental pieces that you can use are highlighted as well (i.e. vantage points to grapple to, floor grates to hide in, weak wood paneling that can be punched through). It helps out a ton, and you'll constantly be relying on it during the \"Predator\" sections of the game, where you'll be trying to clear out a room full of armed thugs without being detected.The boss battles in this game were very enjoyable, and while some were pretty difficult, most of them were manageable. Most bosses have a specific quickfire gadget that you'll need to use, and a hint will pop up on the screen explaining which one. Although you start out with tons of gear, once you gain a specific amount of XP, you can level up, allowing you to select new WayneTech upgrades, such as improved Combat or Ballistic Armor, gadgets, and combo moves that you can use.Batman: Arkham City has 4 difficulty modes, Easy, Normal, Hard, and New Game +. NG+ is unlocked upon completion of the game on Normal or Hard difficulty. I recommend Normal for a first-time playthrough, because it doesn't present anything too difficult, but isn't a cakewalk either. NG+ is an extremely hard difficulty, and you'll have to adapt and improve to conquer it. In New Game Plus, you start out the game with all of your previously unlocked gear, and is equivalent to Hard in terms of the damage that you take. However, you're going to need all of your gear, because the game starts out with tougher, smarter, and more amounts of enemies. You'll need to plan out each and every attack that you make. On top of that, there is no counter indicator! Normally, when an enemy is about to strike, a blue lightning bolt would appear over their head, signaling you to counter. But not here! The game gives you no warning as to when they'll strike, and you'll have to be watching the enemies very closely to survive. New Game Plus has a different save category than your normal game, so when you start the game again on New Game Plus, you won't lose any progress of your other playthrough.Upon completing the campaign, you also unlock Riddler's Revenge, which is a bunch of challenge maps playable with the normal or DLC characters. You unlock additional maps by collecting Riddler Trophies, and also by buying the map pack. Most maps are either wave-based maps where you can see how many points you can get in 5 waves, or Predator maps, where you try to clear out a room stealthily as fast as possible. This mode is very fun, and provides a lot more entertainment.DLC:So far, there have been about 6 DLC packs, the Catwoman pack (play as Catwoman in Riddler's Revenge and 4 main story missions), Robin pack (play as Robin in Riddler's Revenge), Nightwing pack (play as Nightwing in Riddler's Revenge), Challenge Map Pack (extra Riddler's Revenge maps), the Arkham City Skins Pack (extra character skins that you can change in-game for Batman), and Harley Quinn's Revenge (main story expansion with Robin). You'll get all of these for free with the Game of the Year Edition, which I highly recommend you buy, because it's $10 more for $30 worth of stuff. If you get the Arkham Bundle, which is Robin pack, Nightwing pack, and Arkham City Skins pack, which saves you about $5.OVERVIEW:This is a great game with awesome characters, fluid gameplay, and pure fun! One of the best that I've ever played.10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2012"}

Saint's Row 2 doesn't have the technical pizzazz of GTA IV.  GTA IV is an amazing simulator of a living, breathing city.  Saint's Row 2 won't have your jaw dropping like GTA IV will.  But Saint's Row 2 is more fun by leaps and bounds.Saints Row 2 doesn't hinder itself with realism.  It's downright silly at times, but that's because Fun is King when it comes to Saint's Row 2.  Yes, you're going to steal cars, go on missions, do side quests, take out rival gangs... but you don't have to spend five minutes driving to a mission every time you fail, you don't have a stupid pager going off all the time and the game sacrifices realism for the sake of gameplay.So, if you want to &#34;live the experience,&#34; GTA IV may be a superior title for you.

I could not coordinate myself well enough to play with the controller. I thought maybe it was just me, but when the 11 and 12 year old took a turn, they ended up having to both play at the same time just to hit all the right queues. One of them did the turntable and the other did the cross-fader. They played for about 15 minutes before putting the game aside and not playing with it again. The turntable controller feels like it could be bigger, or maybe the buttons could be repositioned a little. It was awkward, but at least it was easier to master than the crossfade bar was.

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Squads is a good mode for those who hate playing against others online","reviewText":"**Please note that this is a 1st impression look and not a full on review!!**Let me be one of the first people to say that I am not `great' at CoD multiplayer.  I am not one of those guys who has the time or patience to grind out  29 hrs a day 10 days a week and 35 days a month into playing CoD multiplayer, but God bless the ones that do.  If you are one of those guys who are great twitch shooters and who will have prestiged by the end of the weekend and unlocked all that there is to unlock, congrats are in order and you can skip this right now.For the rest of you guys out there that are so-so in CoD multiplayer, listen up, Squads mode is for you.For the past few years, the Call of Duty franchise has slowly but surely building in modes that allows the game to be accessible to those who don't want feel like they have to grind to open everything up or worse yet get left behind by their peers who have the time to play and grind it out.There is a bit of grinding to do however but you can do it at your own pace.  The idea is simply this, you start off with yourself and 5 AI bots and play in some of the different modes available in the game MP style.  Depending on the mode, the game can match you up with others within your same skill level so that way you at least feel that you have a chance to make a difference and stay competitive.  What I did notice and like the most is that opposed to last year's game, the Ai here is a bit more realistic this time around.  There are bots that will camp, go Rambo into a situation or are just methodical but all in all it's just realistic enough to feel as if you are playing with humans without the added drama of an 8 year old screaming obscenities into your ear...or your friends making you look bad.The grind comes in where the longer you play the more coins you earn to open up new AI bots for your team and as you open them up, they all have different loadouts and stats are kept for your team.  Then as you open enough of them you also need to earn coins to open up more weapons, perks, uniforms and so forth.  The idea is simply the more you play Squads the more stuff that you get but it's a little lower pressured that straight multiplayer gaming.Another incentive to play this mode is that if your friends are playing this mode, you can pit your squad against their squad and they don't even have to be on to do so.  The cool part about this is when you initially set up your squad, you can set up a `home HQ' of sorts when if someone challenges your squad, they will play on your turf which you can customize with the particular maps, play time,  and rounds to play and then if you or your friends are offline, when you log back in and check your squad report, you will be able to see how well they fared if they played while you were offline and you can still level up from that.There is so much more I could say about it but I would leave it up to you as a player to find out the ins and outs of how this mode works best for you.There are a few cons to this however.  One is that occasionally, I have noticed some of the AI Bots getting stuck in place and unable to move. It's not gamebreaking but just odd that I saw that happen and really it may have been 3 times in the hours that I played last night.Another thing I didn't like is when you are going through your friend list to find players, it would be cool if there was a way to sort out who has registered or not registered the game to play. Shockingly most of my friends didn't get CoD yet or have not played Squads mode so I couldn't play their teams and there is no way to sort this.Another thing that I noticed and not just in Squads but in multiplayer play period, is that some of the maps are overly large and while sometimes travelling in one direction looking for targets a firefight will break out in the opposite direction and by the time you reach it, it's all over.That's pretty much it but just in my opinion as a guy who doesn't play CoD as much and some of the gamehawks, I have seen play, Squads hits that sweet spot for those who really don't want to dive full fledged into multiplayer with others and just want to get in and get out from just a few minutes to an hour or 2.Lastly, even if you are really `anti-social',  if you don't want to play Squads, you still have the ability to play multiplayer modes where you can completely customize everything from the maps you play to the weapons loadouts and AI levels and still have a blast without ever playing against another person.This year's Call of Duty is one of the best at giving an experience that you can play with on your own terms.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"Andrew Hamada","summary":"A wonderful game, but not for everyone.","reviewText":"Rating says the game is good, but it's definitely not for everyone.  Those who are used to the Final Fantasy series by Square will probably be  disappointed by this game because, quite simply - they are of different  genres.  FF is a pure, solid, RPG game without a trace element of Action,  Adventure, or Puzzle.  Vagrant Story, on the other hand, is a combination  of all 4 above genres - and the result is not only fun and entertaining,  but exciting as well.Breakdown-Graphics - Absolutely beautiful  detail, high polygonal characters with lush backgrounds and well-designed  dungeons.  It's good to see that Square does really good work with graphics  even without touching CGI FMV.  Lots of little graphical tweaks (like  accurate shadows, detailed faces) make this game beautiful to watch.  Best  of all, all of the cut scenes are presented using in-game graphics, with  almost cinematic camera shots and techniques - it feels like you're  watching a movie.Music/Sound - Great for atmospherics, but nothing too  memorable for me other than the intro music (played alongside the only FMV  sequence in the entire game).  This is probably the poorest section of the  game, especially given Square's reputation for hiring composers such as  Nobuo Uematsu to do their wonderful orchestrated music.Storyline - Two  thumbs up, the story progresses at a nice, even pace and there aren't any  ridiculous twists and turns in the plotline that make it sound forced.  The  ending is one hell of a clincher...and definitely some of the clearer work  that Square has done recently.Characters - Well developed, etc. etc.  I  like the characters.  We get to know them relatively well, and any  information that we don't receive isn't very important to begin  with.System - This is where the game shines.  The Parasite Eve style  battle system, offence/defence chain abilities, and workshop ideas are all  awesome.  Plus, for the hardcore gamer, technicalities such as weapon  vulnerability, elemental affinity, and monster type all play a role in  effecting the damage you do.It's a great game.  Buy it.  But only if  you're not one of those narrow minded people who thinks there is no Square  outside of Final Fantasy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2000"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Troy","summary":"The Best Role-Player AND How To Fix the Load Time Problem","reviewText":"I've noticed a couple people complain about the load times (especially during battles).  There's a quick and easy fix for PS2 owners: In the main menu under the PS1 Driver, there's a setup option for \"Fast Loading\".  When you turn that on, the game will load as fast as the original cartridge did.  Problem solved..And now for the game: Chrono Trigger is one of, perhaps even *the best*, role-playing game ever made.  Final Fantasy 6 is my favorite in that series, but Chrono Trigger has a stronger appeal for me, personally, because of the time travel/sci-fi theme.  You and your characters travel across several thousand years (from medieval times to a distant, robotic future), in your quest to beat back the bad guys.  The battle system allows you to chain your characters together for extra-powerful attacks, which is a unique innovation.  Finally, how the game ends is never the same.  Like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, the ending varies depending upon how you play the game.  Chrono Triggers offers lots of replayability, and is a true masterpiece.As for FF4, the game is somewhat weak.  Many call FF4 their favorite final fantasy, but I was not too impressed.  I'd put it somewhere in the middle.  It was originally designed to run on the 1980's 8-bit Nintendo, but at the last minute FF4 was upgraded to run on the just-released 16-bit Super Nintendo, and it comes across as primitive, both in graphics and story.  Not as good as what came later (FF anthology).Bottom Line: Buy Final Fantasy 4/Chrono Trigger right now... mainly for Chrono Trigger, but also to satisfy your curiosity about FF4.  If you're like me, you'll cherish it forever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Alex Honda \"onyx575\"","summary":"Camera works against you!","reviewText":"I really wanted to like this game. And after reading most of the favorable reviews here, I thought why not? I like Disney... I like RPG's (Role Playing Games)...so I'll give it a try.The graphics are nice with little difference between game play and cut scenes and the storyline seems really involved. However, the problem I had was with the game's camera.I know this is a problem with most 3-D/free roaming games and it's no exception here. The camera wants to constantly shift to give you a better view of the character you're playing, which is great if you're watching a movie, but not so good if you're playing a game. And yes, you can control the camera by pressing the R2 and L2 buttons at the same time, which repositions the camera behind the character, but as soon as you move, the camera swings again, giving you a different perspective.With all the swinging involved, I got motion sickness after about an hour of game play. I know that game designers want to wow us with all of the camera angles etc., and how they can blur the lines between watching a movie and playing a game, but watching the character you're controlling run towards the camera, when you really need to see where you're going, is not helpful.Another thing I don't like is that the camera is really closeup and you can't really see the environment clearly unless you switch to the first person/character view, which allows you to see through the character's eyes, but that slows down game play.If I had known about the camera problems I would have passed on this game. I know that most people aren't bothered by this, but for me, I can't get into the game with the camera going to and fro all the time, making me nauseous.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2007"}

Before she was caught, Zelda managed to shatter the Triforce of Wisdom and scatter its eight pieces throughout Hyrule. Link swore to recover the Triforce pieces and rescue Princess Zelda from Ganon's clutches.","reviewerName":"JRP","summary":"Zelda NES review","reviewText":"This is something I rarely do review a video game oddly enough that's how I started off reviewing video games in late 08 early 09 on my older account. But lately I have been on a big Zelda kick the past 4 or 5 months I decided to review The Zelda games I own a while back I got a Nintendo 64 after my old N64 gave out after 12 or 13 years of service. Plus I bought a Gamecube to play Zelda Twilight Princess. So starting off I will review the original game The Legend Of Zelda on The NES. Released in 1987 not much story to tell on it cause it tells you the basic plot at the beginning. There is this Princess named Zelda who has been captured by Ganon who has came to this fictional country or kingdom whatever it is called Hyrule he wants this object of great power called The Triforce cause it can grant wishes if you wish for good things then good things happen if you wish for evil well evil things will go down. Ganon wants to take over the world what else. Zelda has broken The Triforce into 8 parts & there in 8 different dungeons & only 1 man can stop Ganon & that's Link or whatever you decide to call him. You start off & get a Wooden Sword most people go to the 1st dungeon but you can get 2 heart pieces & upgrade your sword. If you have full health then you can fire projectile's from your sword. There are different kinds of weapons you use to take care of your problems there is a bow & arrow which is in about every Zelda game except for Zelda II. A boomerange, bombs which can be used to blow open holes to make a passage way which that technique is used in a lot of Zelda games. You also have candles that let you see in dark rooms. When you get the wand & The Book Of Magic aka The Bible then candles become useless. You collect rupees which is the currency in Zelda to buy items. If you get up to 14 hearts then you get The Magical Sword a precursor to The Master Sword. If you have never played a Zelda game then there is a boss you fight at the end of each dungeon & if you are 1 of those people that haven't played a Zelda game then I don't know what's wrong with you you're missing out. The 1st boss Aquamentus is easy to beat especially when you have a real sword & it's even easier the 2nd time around when you have The Magical Sword. The 2nd dungeon has a boss known as a Dodongo which reappears in a couple more dungeons. In The 3rd Dungeon you face a Manhandla it does reappear in other dungeons. The Gleeok is the boss for the 4th dungeon. The 5th dungeon has a very easy boss called a Digdogger when you learn what to do it's the easiest boss in a Zelda game. Another sort of easy boss is Gohma it can be killed with 1 shot from your bow & arrow. Aquaments reappears as the boss for the 7th dungeon & Gleeok reappears as the boss for the 8th dungeon. Of course the last boss is Ganon himself & some say he's easy some say he's hard. Don't kid anyone he is difficult but not impossible. I'd actually say Ganon was hardest on A Link To The Past. Remember if it's your 1st time playing you need The Silver Arrows to kill Ganon. I always found it funny the names Nintendo gave to the enemies like The Skeltons are called Stalfos. The snakes are called Ropes. The Mummies are called Gibdos. The spider enemies are called Tektites & their mother spider is called Gohma. You also have different assortment of enemies like The Pol Voice, Vire, keese which are bats. Dark Nuts which I hate those things. Wizrobe's I hate those things too & Wallmaster's I really hate those things. You have these Centar creatures called Tynel's for some reason as a kid I though they were half human half dogs. Or those things called Peahats which as a kid I called them flying peaches or flying pineapples. The enemies always looked weird to me as a kid like The Pols Voice I called them I thought they were evil rabbits heads jumping around as a kid. The Zora I called devil fish. Bottom line is The Legend Of Zelda was fresh in 1986 & 87 cause of the adventure & puzzle solving. For the younger crowd who never played this game & have played the newer Zelda titles & decide to play any of the 2D Zelda games then you'll need a lot of free time & a lot of patience to complete it I don't care if you use cheats it still takes time to get through the game cause of all the time it takes to figure out dungeons. Next review for The Zelda games I own will be The Adventure Of Link Zelda II. Cause I did finally get the will power to beat it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2013"}

The game play, though, lacks so much to be desired.  The story doesn't flow very smoothly at all, and the play control isn't very precise.  About 95% of the game seems to be boss battles, where you really can't tell whether or not you are even hurting the boss or how much damage the boss actually has.  The rest is just some hack and slash nonsense interrupted by some cool dialogue and music.If this was a movie, I would probably rate it much higher.  But it's not.

The two games certainly follow a similar approach, although there are quite significant differences (aside from the time this game is set in).Personally, I like the graphics in Mafia better. Overall,t he whole story is told in more style, and is much more immersive IMO.However, GTA offers more freedom while playing the game. Mafia offers a lot of freedom too, but in order to fulfill missions, one usually sticks to one path. Some people told me they don't like that as much. Personally, I like the Mafia gameplay at least as good as the GTA gameplay. Sure, GTA gives you a mission such as \"destroy this car\", and you have a million ways to accomplish that. Mafia gives you a mission such as \"have this race car manipulated\", and naturally, there is one place to pick it up, and one place to bring it to have the work done.While you play the game however, that difference doesn't matter very much. In fact, Mafia provides a somewhat tighter storyline to provide a more detailed, intriguing story. I personally prefer that.Mafia also seems to have a bit more variety in the missions. They have everything from missions on foot where you shoot 1st person style, to driving missions, to even races.I like the controls in Mafia much better than GTA. In GTA, things never seem quite right. The controls used don't work truely well when you are an foot, and they don't work very well in the cars either. But they kinda work for both. In Mafia, you use the regular FPS-style keyboard and mouse combination when you walk, and a whole different set of controls when you drive. In fact, a (force feedback) steering wheel works very well in Mafia, while I found it to work not too well at all in GTA.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2003"}

They had some very high expectations after their previous groundbreaking release &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;.  Battlefield Vietnam is an extremely fun game to play from the first minute (in fact, before you even start you'll be moved by the level of detail and attention that went into the pre-game screens; the UI is insanely intuitive, the music is some kind of 70's funk-electro mix with dubs of Lyndon Johnson in it...RAD).  Getting in a game is a snap, their are tons of servers, and plenty of room in multiplayer mode.In game, you'll be very impressed with the graphics.  Next to Far Cry (which has undoubtedly the best graphics by far in any game today) the graphics are breathtaking.  Lush jungle, totally reanimated water (from BF1942), cool particle effects, refraction...you name it, this isn't a mod, they substantially improved the engine.The play speed is slightly faster paced than 1942, but not noticably.  Those who liked the physics of 1942, the vehicle speed, combat speed, damage-take speed...well, you'll be right at home.As for specs, if you can run 1942, you should have no trouble.  In fact, a friend of mine (who has a somewhat dated system) contends that Vietnam runs better on his machine (I haven't independently verified).But lets talk about the coolest thing in the game:Music!Not just music, but mega $ super hits from the 70's.  EA spent the big bucks and enabled the game with a bunch of really cool tracks.  Now I understand that many games have music, but what's so special about this game is that OTHERS HEAR the music you're playing!  Get in a vehicle, choose a song from the playlist and it blasts from your vehicle (louder the closer in proximity you are to others).  Add helicopters, you get a monster load of gaming goodness!  I was in an Apache last weekend chasing a convoy (including two of my buddies) through the jungle bumping &quot;Nowhere to run to baby, nowhere to hide....&quot; from my Heli.  I could practically hear them screaming &quot;oh S@#$&quot; from their PC's.  RAD!A few very minor grievances:  First off, you'll notice this game is like 5 disks to download (yikes).  But that's minor.  Another issue that is really just my opinion (because I think helicopters are so cool)...I take issue with just how vulnerable they are in the game...Jet Fighters eat them for lunch, but from the ground the Surface to Air Missiles ARE GUIDED!  Needless to say, even the most experienced pilots will be having some pretty short trips on allot of maps.  Also, and this is just my experience with a very popular mod for 1942 (Desert Combat), I actually found the helicopters easy to fly.  But again, for those of you who remember the first few versions of DC, they were released when 1942 didn't have any real flight guidance software for developers.  Helicopter flying was INSANELY HARD.  I literally spent over 50 hours flying before I could reliably land and pick people up.  You get a private helicopter license with only 40 hours in the &quot;Real World&quot;...!Anyway, this game is a blast and worth every dollar.  You'll be wowed by the game and laughing hysterically on your first map.  EA did it again.I hope this was helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2004"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

Simpsons game.  Ever.","reviewText":"This is without a doubt the best Simpsons game ever because it comes the closest to doing something that I've always wanted a Simpsons game to do and that is let you play an episode of the show.  Most Simpsons games have you doing silly nonsense like wrestling and fighting aliens and don't allow you to really interact with the Simpsons world.  Although it is not quite as interactive as I would like.  For instance you can't talk to people very often unless it is part of a mission.  Although they well talk quite a bit if you kick them in the head.  As far as the gameplay goes, there are several types of missions but they basically fall into several broad categories.  There are missions where you have to race people.  Another mission is the trail where you have to follow another vehicle and keep them from losing you and another mission that is the complete opposite in which you have to lose someone.  Some missions have multiple objectives, which can be annoying, especially since failing one objective means you have to go back and sart the whole mission over.  There are also missions where you have to wreck other people's vehicles.  This is the closest this game ever gets to Grand Theft Auto which is what this game is based on.  The only thing that I don't like is that this game gets really hard really quick.  Another bad thing is there is no map that comes with the game unlike Grand Theft Auto.  The only thing you have to guide you is a small radar like thing and green arrows to quide you in the general direction you want to go.  However, in order to beat the harder levels you need to find the shortcuts which the arrows do not point out.  in order to find them you have to scout out the area before starting the mission.  Luckily, you can skip missions after repeated failure which is good for people who suck at these type of games, like me.  I'm on the marge level now and I have only beaten one of the levels.  I've skipped at least three of them.  Other than the somewhat severe difficulty however this game is great.  Any Simpsons fan will love it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2003"}

I was just hoping that the regular MP would suffice this time around...It doesn't.  Not by a long shot.  FOR ME.The majority of the positive reviews for this game, about the fun factor, gameplay, cutscenes, weapons, sound, etc. are all accurate, in my opinion.  However, I played R2 up until last week.  Sure, I didn't play it every day, but I did play it still.  But, I didn't play the campaign over and over, nor did I play standard MP.  I played the Co-op.I have 3 friends that I loved to play co-op with whenever we got the opportunity, and our schedules aligned.  R3 took that away, and in my opinion they didn't replace that with anything better.I should have known I was going to be disappointed when the beta was opened only to PS+ members... aka you had to pay to play the beta.  Everybody wants more money...  =/UPDATE 9/20/11:  I cannot play the single player campaign.  The game keeps freezing on Chapter 5.  I've been trying for the last 45 minutes to get it to work... but every time I get to this particular part the game freezes and I have to manually turn off my PS3 (will not work via controller).  Now, my PS3 was working fine last night for Deus Ex and I just tried Netflix and that was working fine-that tells me it is the game.  Utter disaster.

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Ramos","summary":"Some Features Seem Half-Baked","reviewText":"I've been waiting for Resistance 3 for a VERY long time. In fact, other then Battlefield 3, it's the only game I was looking forward to playing this fall. So far the campaign is great, but there are two features that really need a lot of fixing before it feels like a complete package.1. Horrible PlayStation Move Controls: It's simply awful, the controls feel awkward until you tweak the settings. Even then there's one problem you can't fix at all. The problem is when you use ADS, the gun movement slows down to a crawl. Killzone 3 never had that problem and that game is a joy to play with the PS Move. If Insomniac can fix that, then it will finally be playable with Move.2. 3D Has A Lot Of Glitches: For some reason the 3D doesn't seem fully functional cause I run into graphical glitches ALL THE TIME! It even froze at one point. Also the text that appears during cut scenes was poorly rendered, so it looks terrible and throws off the depth perception. This probably isn't a problem for 90% of the people who will play this game, but for 3DTV owners, it's a big disappointment.Overall, I'm greatly disappointed in this game since I can't play it with the Move. But other then that, it's a great game with an epic campaign that definitely delivers for people who want to play on a standard TV with a Dualshock 3. Hopefully Insomniac will collaborate with Guerrilla (the makers of Killzone 3) and find out how to adopt the same PS Move control layout for R3. Until then it is what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2011"}

S.\"","summary":"Strap on your six shooters, grab your Winchester, mount your horse and don't forget your hat.","reviewText":"Red Dead Redemption is an epic game that few games could rival.  Everything from the way nature lives and breathes to the way the wind blows in your hair are so realistic and life-like that they make Red Dead Redemption seem more like a movie than a game.  Not to mention its gripping storyline that follows former outlaw John Marston on his quest to settle his past.  Throughout the story, John meets a variety of different and interesting characters from swindling salesmen to Mexican banditos.  The whole selection of weapons that John wields are as varied as the people he meets.  From classic six shooters and Winchester repeaters to deadly throwing knives and fire bombs, John makes quick work of his foes.  This is a game you won't soon forget.The story starts off with John being escorted onto a train bound for a small town in the middle of the desert.  His mission is to capture or kill an old friend of his.  But it wasn't his choice; FBI agents kidnapped John's family and threatened to kill them if he didn't comply.  So John finds himself in this predicament and has to do what he has to do.  But when the time comes, it doesn't work out so well and John has to try again, this time killing every man in his way, one man at a time.There are also a lot of funny lines in the game.  Some are said by John and some are said by random people.  Here's a list of some funny lines:Uncle: \"You sound like you have a bad case of Hemorrhoids.\"John: \"You're about to be suffering from a bad case of someone just shot me in the face if you don't do what you're told!\"John: \"You're so crooked, you swallow nails and spit out corkscrews!\"John: \"You keep talkin' and I'm gonna put a bullet in that hillbilly head of yours, and watch your idiot brains spill out.\"Irish: \"What's the spanish word for c**t?\"John: \"You tell me...you must have been called it a few times.\"John: (while skinning a deer) \"Let me take your coat madam.\"John: \"I'll give you an insight. I'll show you your own guts.\"Revolutionary: \"De Santa is the type of man who likes to shoot men when they're on their knees.\"John: \"I bet he likes to do other stuff to men on their knees as well.\"Soldier: \"I have a bad feeling about this...\"John: \"Maybe you just need to take a piss or something.\"There are a whole lot of things to do in Red Dead.  First off, there is an economy.  You make money on missions, on selling goods, or looting it from dead bodies or chests.  In every major town there is a general store, doctor, gunsmith, and saloon.  In the first three stores, you can buy and sell things.  Some things you can buy are: maps, ammo, guns, health, bait, and horses.  Some things you can sell are: herbs and animal skins.  You find these two throughout the whole world.  Different species of animals and plants can be found in certain areas and sometimes you have to find a certain kind of animal and it is challenging to know where to look for it.  You can also play Texas Hold 'Em poker, blackjack, liars dice, five finger fillet, horseshoes and arm wrestling.  If you don't know what poker, blackjack, horseshoes and arm wrestling are, you might want to get out more.  Five finger fillet is the game where you stab the knife in between your fingers quickly and try to beat the time limit and liars dice is a game where you try not to get caught lying about your dice under a cup and try to catch your opponent lying.  If you are talented in these areas, this is a great way to make money.Apart from making money, there are two different ratings for your character; Honor and Fame.  Honor determines how people react to you.  It can go up or down based on your actions.  To receive good honor: help innocent people, take prisoners alive, return stolen money or fight bandits.  To receive bad honor: kill innocent people, kill prisoners, keep stolen money or help the bandits.  Having good honor will get you a discount in stores, make your items worth more when you sell, and make the law more lenient of you.  Having bad honor will do the opposite.  Fame will make strangers come up to you more often and ask for help and it also makes the law for lenient(for example, if you have really high fame, when committing a crime, the bounty placed on your head is half of what it would normally be).  Whether you choose to help strangers is your choice.  That is the most wonderful thing about Red Dead, so many thigns are optional it seems like you are blazing your own path.  Also makes great for replay value, one time play the good guy and next time play the bad guy.There are also two jobs that are available in major towns.  Horse breaking and nightwatch.  The former is lassoing a wild horse, jumping on top of it and moving the analog stick back and forth to stay centered.  It lasts for 15 or 20 seconds, then the horse suddenly stops and is broken in.  While this is fun, you only make about $6-10 for it, so this isn't a job you should spend a lot of time at.  The latter only can be done at night (obviously) and is where you follow a dog around and stop trouble.  It usually is breaking up a fight, stopping a cattle rustler, or saving a woman from a gang.  When it is over you go to the police and they give you cash.  Often times, it is over $100! Not bad money.There are also different outfits, just like in GTA games.  The first one that is also the standard one is the bounty hunter outfit.  You can unlock outfits by finding objects, completing jobs or tasks or buying scraps of clothing at tailors.  Most outfits have special talents.  The bounty hunter, duster (where you wear an old duster that doesn't do anything except make you look cool), and cattle rancher outfits don't have any abilities.  But the elegant suit outfit makes it possible to cheat at poker, the several gang outfits make you less apt to get shot at by that particular gang, the US marshal outfit makes the lawmen turn a blind eye at some of your crimes and there are other outfits that I have yet to unlock like a US army uniform and a bureau uniform.The world of Red Dead looks awesome.  Whether you're up in the high mountains of America with snow on the ground hunting grizzlies or you're down in Mexico with dust flying all over the place hunting Armadillos, the graphics and animation will be superb.  Weapons look great too.  You of course have your standard six shooters and repeaters.  But you also have shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, throwing knives, dynamite, fire bombs and a lasso.  You start out with bad guns and get better ones as you progress.  For example, you start out with a pretty bad six shooter and eventually can get a fully automatic German pistol.  You can use the lasso to capture horses or take criminals alive.  Taking them alive for bounty missions earns you twice as much money!Yes there are showdowns.  It wouldn't be a western without them.  It is necessary for a few missions, but most of the time it is optional.  Usually while riding through a town, some gunslinger leaning against a post would yell \"I heard you're pretty fast with a gun, care to prove it?\".  You could either accept and then when the time is right activate the red dead meter and kill him or you could walk away.  Accepting will get you a small amount of fame and you can always loot his body for some small dinero.  I've actually found that the showdowns are difficult for me.  I might have missed something, but I'm not sure.The characters, guns, trees, animals and all other aspects come together to make a great western that has a tense story with a shocking finish and is full of hours of wild west action using pistols, rifles, Gatling guns, or just plain old knives.  Red Dead Redemption is worth the money and also has an interesting and challenging online multiplayer that is also open world just like the game.Bottom line: RDR is a great game that allows you choose your path and with the superb graphics, depth, and details when it ends, you feel like a part of you went with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2010"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

It was a rare gem.  One of the few games that I voluntarily replayed over 8 times, beginning to end, skipping none of the content.  The game itself took well over 35 hours to complete...that is A LOT of invested time.  I loved every minute of it...well...not really.  I may never hate a gameplay segment as much as I hated driving around the same identical-looking overly steep barren planets with that abysmal Mako mechanic.  Honestly, every time I replayed ME, it was with a new character class and new background origin.  And each time I played, there was ALWAYS something different...ALWAYS.  Most of the time it was minor, other times it was drastic, but there was always another reason to replay the game.  It is one of my most beloved games on the XBox 360, and hands down my favorite Science Fiction video game universe.  So with Mass Effect 2, what do we have?  More of the same?  Not even...read on!==This review may contain VERY MINOR SPOILERS==Story:From the get-go, I was amazed.  The intro was exciting and the fate of Commander Shepard left me sitting there like a monkey, scratching my head in sheer confusion, trying to use the 360 controller to scratch my rear.  And then we're introduced yet again to the enigmatic enemy organization that played a minor role in the first game: Cerberus.  And right off the bat, the game gets far more interesting.  Being less of a continuation to the previous entry's Reaper story, the second game in the series focuses on Commander Shepard building an elite team of Specialists from all corners of the galaxy.  A good 90% of the good revolves around the development of these characters an earning their loyalty, while a mere 10% of the game concerns the Reaper/Collector threat and the motivations of Cerberus.  Like the first game, the character development is outstanding, though some characters could have used more fleshing out.  I would get into greater detail but...can it wait for a bit?  I'm in the middle of some calibrations.Gameplay:Ah yes, \"Gameplay\".  Taking the familiar combat from ME and completely overhauling it, you have a much more action-oriented game than the predecessor.  Sacrificing some of the RPG elements, the gameplay consists of intense combat sequences with often explosive results.  Powers can be hotkeyed to the controller but you will spend the majority of your time utilizing your weapons, and there are many new weapon types to choose from.  More than ever, your class of Commander Shepard affects gameplay and how you approach combat.  A more tech-oriented Shepard (e.g. Engineer) will spend much of combat either using hotkeys or accessing the power \"wheel\", whereas a more direct class such as the Soldier will only access powers on a necessary basis, such as the new ammo powers.  This makes combat more fun, more streamlined and more intense than ever.Gone are certain familiar abilities...such as crouching.  You can only crouch in cover, and for some reason the first 14 hours of gameplay was seriously funky for me as I constantly tried to crouch to line up a more steady shot with my sniper rifle, but its a small price to pay.  Also missing are the annoying timed button presses to \"hack\" a locker.  In its place are 3 new minigames that get tiresome quickly but are a nice change of pace from the original.Dialog is more important than ever, but thankfully there are no dialog-only side quests (Remember the woman and her brother-in-law arguing over her baby's immunizations?).  The character interaction is great, with each member of your party having a different impact on the mission.  You assure each character's loyalty by completing their personal mission, but even then, the wrong decision could affect how they respond later in the game (and ultimately their fate).Exploration is a cinch...NO MORE DRIVING THAT %*($ING MAKO AROUND!  There are a few people that actually enjoyed that...I guess if you like mind-numbing mountain climbing exercises with horrific vehicular mechanics, then hey it's your game!  But there are no planetside exploration sequences...everything is done from orbit with a scan, though this too gets boring.  Only when the AI detects an anomaly will you drop planetside, and only for the mission.Difficulty:Playing this game even on the second highest diffculty is pretty fun...Insanity difficulty was hands down the worst gaming experience of my life and I refused to play ME2 again for over a month after finally beating Insanity.  Unrewarding, frustrating and just plain unfair, Insanity makes all of your tech/biotic powers useless since all enemies are immune, as well as equipping every singly enemy with Biotic Barrier, Shield, Armor and Health.  Unless Achievement mean everything to you, in my opinion it wasn't worth the frustration and nearly broken controller.Bells & Whistles:Hands down one of the best soundtracks available.  No more of the late 1980's style electronica or techno beats...this game has a fully composed score with a truly inspiring main theme.  Sound effects are crisp and clean, while voice acting remains top notch.Overall:New features, intense gameplay and always another reason to keep coming back...ME2 will keep you occupied for months.  I will close out this review by listing Pros and Cons.Pros:- Deep, 40+ hour enriching gameplay experience- New, Improved and far more intense combat- Even deeper character development- Choice-based story elements mean that you will NEVER play the same game twice- Character development system simplified and improved- Amazing graphics, sound and musical score...one of the best examples of this generation- Fantastic DLC support with \"Cerberus Network\" add-on that constantly keeps you up on upcoming DLC and optional goodies.- Easy-to-earn Achievements with a very rewarding system for replaying the game and importing Mass Effect 1 profiles.Cons:- Loyalty system not as complex as originally promised...it simply comes down to choice A or choice B- Loyalty missions vastly different in context...some missions such as Garrus are combat intensive, whereas missions like Thane's are so simple and devoid of action that they seem like an afterthought.- Unforgiving checkpoint system means truly frustrating losses...battles on higher difficulties can last nearly an hour, and if you fail that's a whole hour you must replay.- Insanity difficulty might be TOO insane...an ultimately unrewarding gameplay experience unless you are a masochist- Very glitchy in true Bioware fashion...I attribute at least 45% of my deaths to glitches.- Government censorship and whiney parents win again...sorry folks but your R-rated sexual appetite whetted in the first game is reduced to PG!This is hands down my favorite 360 game...I have played it through 3 times without skipping any content, and fully intend to replay it several more times.  Each time I've played the experience has been so engrossing and different that I feel I will NEVEr truly see everything in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2010"}

Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Media Lover","summary":"MUCH Better than Expected","reviewText":"This game is, quite simply, the best jungle shooter I've ever played.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"War sucks","reviewText":"I really thought that I was going to like Darksiders. The combat started off fast and satisfying, Mark Hamil voiced a lead role, and War kicked tons of ass. 2 hours into the game though, the combat was already stale, Mark Hamil wasn't given anything interesting to say, and War was a bit of a jerk.Darksiders \"borrows\" from several, better, games, but never fully utilizes what it takes. Lets start with the combat. When you start off, you have one attack button;enjoy it because that is pretty much all you will use for quite sometime. Sure you can spend money on new moves, but besides the game breaking harpoon tackle, most of them are pretty much useless. I played this on the hardest difficulty, and it was still too easy. Half way through the game, your wrath powers (magic) are so powerful, they almost feel like a cheat code. Stone skin = no challenge.Zelda is known for its fun, and creative use of puzzles that are sprinkled throughout its many dungeons. Darksiders seems to have dozed off when learning about puzzles because in every room, of every freaking dungeon is a puzzle, or mandatory fight. Every Room. The puzzles never evolve beyond move block to get key to open door, and by the end of the game they are downright painful to play through. The puzzles come in two flavors; boring and easy, or obnoxiously annoying. You never get a sense that they were put there for any other reason than to pad a few hours onto the game.Now, for all you achievement hunters, I have some bad news. There are only three flavors available; story achievements,  achievements that require hours of grinding, or the aerial predator achievement. The first category is self explanatory. The second is where the game goes out of its way to be unfun. As you might have noticed from the box art, you have a horse, Ruin. There are two achievements attached to him, and neither of them are any fun. The first is to ride him 100 miles; the best way to do this is to rubberband your controller, and go and do something else. Where is the fun in that? Another achievement is to max out all of your weapons; here is a tip, you get a new sword towards the end of the game that is already maxed out so all you have to worry about are the scyhte and gauntlet. The problem is  neither of these weapons will ever be half as good as your sword, so no real good comes from maxing them out. Lastly, the aerial predator achievement is downright sadistic. Look online to see legions of players who have wasted hours getting it, and hated every second, myself included.The story is almost non-existent, and war is such an unfeeling jerk it is impossible to care about what little is happening.The two games that Darksiders rips off are far better, so just buy one of them instead. If you only own an X-box, than get Bayonetta; it may be weird, and have an awful story, but the combat system is fun, the game is challenging, and the overall experience is rewarding. Darksiders is honestly one of the most hollow games that I have ever played. Look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EBRA","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"An RPG/FF fan's review","reviewText":"A new Final Fantasy has finally been released, and it seems SquareEnix has finally got the Japanese and English versions of the game released around each other, instead of waiting forever for a version of the game( FF13-2 came out December in Japan). They are also planning on releasing DLC for this game through 2012, but I'll get to that shortly.Story:The story in this game is phenomenal; it kept me wanting to continue to each node trying to figure out what was going on and how I can save each area. It's really cool going to alternate realities and different timelines, which really allows you to see how your actions have changed the world and what happens in time periods you normally couldn't go to.When you load a save game you are presented with cut scenes on what happened so far, with the game loading in the background. This is so freaking cool and I hope many other games adopt this, instead of just text at a loading screen. Saving is a bit different from Final Fantasy 13; you can save at any time you want and the game auto saves at key moments. When you are in the Historia Crux, you can create save files ala Final Fantasy 13 style, and the last save file you choose is the one it auto saves on.Most of the side missions have their own story arc that might require you to go to different era's to complete them, instead of just kill X monster like Final Fantasy 13. Along with that, at key moments you have a Mass Effect like dialogue option that pops up that allows you to ask a question to what's going on. Most of the responses are serious, but some are so random they just make you laugh. This all leads to one of the best endings I have seen in a Final Fantasy game.Gameplay:They really improved the gameplay over the last game. Paradigm Shifts are instant when you change them now, instead of playing an animation the first time you use it for each battle. Along with that the battle system is so much more fun than the previous game, and it feels more intuitive.Monsters spawn randomly, but they show up on the screen like FF13, with the chance of preemptive strikes using a \"Moogle Clock\" that if you press A(X) and attack the monster while being in the green. You get rewarded with Haste and a minor stagger bonus, and its fun to try to pre-emptive strike everything in the game. They also made five staring battles more worthwhile due to the fact you get 200% increased drop rate bonus at the conclusion of the battle.With Noel and Serah being the only characters you use in the game, you can capture a monsters crystal sometimes after you kill it. So you could have a Behemoth fighting right alongside you and it makes choosing the right role combinations more fun due to the fact monsters have their own strength and weaknesses even if they are the same role.They also added something that is both fun and frustrating at times, and that is puzzles. Most of them add a nice little diversion when you are doing missions and are fun to complete. The ones that make it frustrating are the Time ones. Those got annoying real fast.This game is the first one I have played that has a New Game+ during the game, and not after you beat it. After you complete each section a RB (R1) option pops up that allows you to restart the area back to the beginning, and you can switch right back to the completed version at any time. For me it's really awesome they added this, and I don't have to worry about missing something along the way when you can restart it after you beat it.Soundtrack:I found the soundtrack to be a great addition with mixes of the Final Fantasy 13 music, Singing, and orchestration. I think they continue to do a good job in creating music for FF with Nobuo gone, and I don't mind the addition of a song with lyrics as the main theme of the game. Its quiet varied throughout the game, and like so many other soundtracks, it makes the experience so much better.I enjoyed the voice acting in the game, with none of the voices becoming obnoxious or annoying. Some of the minor NPC's have the same voices, but it's not that big of a deal. All of the sound effects are great, and it's cool to hear the attacking effects.Graphics:This game looks amazing. When it's raining the rain hits the screen along with a good looking raining effect (Some games get this wrong, but not this game); Along with that when it's snowing your characters are actually covered in a bunch of snow and it extends to the monsters when you get into battles. This was astounding to look at, and really makes you feel they are in a cold snowy terrain.Like all other Final Fantasies out there, the cut scenes look beautiful. The people look awesome, and the fights they get into are over the top with amazing visuals of the fighting. It does have that Final Fantasy-ish look to it, but that just adds to the overall experience.Verdict:I know I wrote a lot in this review, but I wanted to convey the fact this game improves so much over the previous game; I also wanted to talk about the parts I really enjoyed in the fight, and that it didn't earn the negative things I have been hearing about this game. During 2012 they're planning on releasing a bunch of DLC, some of it is just outfits, but according to Square-Enix a bunch of enemies are coming to the Coliseum.This game is great for any RPG fan (you will enjoy it more if you beat ff13, but you can still have fun with this if you haven't), and an awesome game for Final Fantasy fans in general. With there being no \"new game key\" you should buy or rent this game ASAP.~ Written: February, 2012Positives:*Moogle weapon :D*Crazy Chocobo remix*Refined gameplay*Amazing graphics*Awesome RPG game*Tons of side missions to do*Great soundtrack*DLC planned for the future*Fun QTE'sNegatives:*NoneAchievements/Trophies:It takes about 30ish hours to beat the game, but like 50-60 hours to fully complete all the achievements/trophies. Most of them are really easy to complete, but I recommended everyone to get all 160 fragments, to experience all the side missions and what not. No item collecting achievements in this game and you can't miss any of them due to the RB/R1 resetting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Really nice game, story, graphics, etc","reviewText":"This is one of the best games to come out recently. I only played the first Bioshock and of course that's another great game set underwater. This one is set in the sky which is mesmerizing to look at a lot of the time just as the first game was. I felt that the first Bioshock had more character to it though with the various bad guys etc but the backdrop was nowhere as dramatic as Infinites. Still the story is quite good for Infinite as well and the action is fun with an imaginative use of American history. Not so sure about replay value, I could see playing through this again and enjoying it more slowly though. I liked the added gameplay dimension of flying through the sky on rails. You really get a rush sometimes due to the perceived heights you are flying through. A decent selection of conventional weapons and your supernatural ones gives continuity with the Bioshock franchise. The graphical details and sound are first class, games do not get much better in this genre, really quality stuff. I recommend it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

Osborn","summary":"Will you be the hero? Or Embrace the Demon within?","reviewText":"Bound by Flame has been on my radar for the last year.  I have been eagerly waiting while paying close attention for new information in every press release.  Now, the time has finally arrived and Bound by Flame is out and I couldn't have been more excited to get the chance to review it.Fantasy role-playing games are one of the most common genres on the market today, probably only behind the likes of first-person shooters.  So, with new fantasy RPGs coming out all the time, you could easily feel like you are drowning while trying to play them all.  That has been the case for me over the past few years.  Games like Skyrim, Dragon Age II, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Dark Souls II, and The Witcher II: Assassins of Kings are all great games in their own right, but they didn't grab me the way I hoped that they would.  The only one on that list that did was Kingdoms of Amalur and it only did because it had the most fun combat system I have ever played in an RPG.  Because of the bad taste left in my mouth by these HUGE blockbuster games, I was skeptical about the possibility of Bound by Flame changing my mind.  Sure, the screenshots and trailers looked pretty cool, but how many times have we been burned by previews like that?  The only glimmer of hope I have been holding on to was that Bound by Flame is developed by Spiders, a small French video game development studio known for games like Of Orcs and Men and Mars: War Logs.  Maybe a small team could develop the perfect fantasy RPG that I have been waiting for.The story in Bound by Flame has a Game of Thrones feel to it, but not in the sense that there is a war between five kings. Instead you should think about the \"White Walkers\".  For those of you who are not familiar with Game of Thrones, the \"White Walkers\" are a race of mythical humanoid creatures that possess magical powers, look akin to zombies, and have a history of waging war on mankind.  The Bound by Flame counterpart to the \"White Walkers\" are the Deadwalkers: an army of rotting, deformed, and downright disgusting zombie-like creatures.  The Deadwalkers were summoned over 150 years ago by the Lords of Ice, who are hell-bent on conquering the world of Vertiel.  The Lords of Ice are a circle of mysterious immortal necromancers who have been successfully leading their legions of undead in the extermination of all other known races.The world of Vertiel was once bountifully populated by humans, elves, dwarves, and the like; however by the time you begin your quest, most of the sentient lifeforms have been wiped off the map and unwillingly joined the Deadwalker army.  You play as Vulcan, an upstart human mercenary with a bad attitude and a lot of sass.  Vulcan belongs to a faction of respected human mercenaries called the Pure-Blades, who are tasked with protecting what's left of the Red Scholars-an ancient Order of mages who are considered to be the last chance of stopping the impending apocalypse brought on by the vicious bloodlust of the Lords of Ice.While protecting the Red Scholars during a ritual intended to stop the Lords of Ice, all hell breaks loose.  Vulcan accidentally ends up on the wrong side of a Demon summoning spell and becomes possessed.  The Demon inside Vulcan is trapped, and has no choice but to help our hero if he chooses to accept it.  As the fight against the Lords of Ice and the Deadwalkers progress, Vulcan is constantly tormented by the Demon, tempting him to give up his humanity in order to gain unheard-of levels of magical powers.I was overwhelmingly obsessed with finding out every little detail about the history of the world and the war with the Undead.  Spiders did a fantastic job at establishing both compelling lore and an awesome story.  I found myself talking to every single character, while making sure to investigate all dialogue options so as not to miss any of the story. Most of the story is told through these dialogue investigations, so if you decide to skip them you will surely miss out.  I wanted to know who the Lords of Ice were, why they were waging war on the entire planet, and who the hell the Demon was that possessed Vulcan.Bound by Flame has an excellent fantasy story; but that being said, I fear that many players may not enjoy spending as much time diving deep into conversations as I did.  By no means is the story told solely through NPC interaction though; you will get the overall picture just by playing and only talking to NPCs necessary for each main quest.  However, there is no way you will enjoy just how rich the story can be by doing this.When comparing Bound by Flame's story to the story of Skyrim, there are obvious similarities in story progression and themes.  However, the aspect that sets Bound by Flame apart from Skyrim (and the myriad of other fantasy RPG clones) is that Bound by Flame does not bother overloading you with thousands of meaningless sidequests.  I will admit, I was once a gamer obsessed with finishing every single sidequest in every game just to say I did it, but that is not the case anymore.  I simply do not have the time or the patience to spend hundreds of hours completing fetch quests and other throwaway chores for characters you will never speak to again.Bound by Flame is exactly what I have been looking for.  Sure, there are sidequests in every camp you enter, but there are a very limited number of them.  Further, most of these are somehow tied to your party members or even to the overarching main storyline.  I was able to complete both the main questline and the majority of the sidequests available in just over 25 hours.  Even if you take your time and attempt to do everything, you will still only clock in about 30-35 hours.  This is the perfect formula for a great fantasy RPG and I commend Spiders for hitting nail on the head.For a game that has been flying under the radar by most of the gaming world, Bound by Flame looks absolutely gorgeous. Many developers these days take the easy way out and use the same color palette throughout the entirety of their game.  Spiders did not abide by these rules and instead built a world made up of incredibly diverse environments.  Each of these environments were beautiful and used different colors to show off their differences.  Even the dreary environments like swamps were and caverns were alluring if you take the time to inspect the detail.However, when comparing Bound by Flame's delightful art style and color palette to that of other games in the genre, it doesn't quite compare the the photorealism that many of these games have achieved in recent years.  With that said, it doesn't take away anything from the game as Spiders studio created an awesome visual style of their own.The voice talent in Bound by Flame is headlined by the established and excellent Robin Atkin Downes as Vulcan.  Downes plays the part to perfection and makes it easy for players to connect with Vulcan and really feel involved in the story.  The entire cast followed Downes amazing lead, making each character interaction that much more enjoyable.  The only downside to these interactions is that there is almost no lip syncing in the game.  If you pay close attention, you will notice that characters mouths will just freely move as they speak and will not look realistic in the least.  The lack of lip syncing was not detrimental to the overall experience for me because I read the subtitles as characters talk instead of watching their faces; but it is obvious that it will be an issue for some players.Speaking of the audio performance in Bound by Flame, I would be remiss to not talk about the soundtrack.  You know a soundtrack has done its job when it delivers tension and emotion at just the right moments.  That is exactly what composer Olivier Derivi&egrave;re (known for his work on Assassin's Creed and Remember Me) was able to do with this soundtrack.  As catchy as most of Bound by Flame's songs are, you will quickly notice that there aren't a whole lot of them.  You will spend a lot of time in each environment so by the time you have completed each section of the game, you have probably heard the same songs played repeatedly for hours.  The collection of songs you will experience really are superb at establishing the perfect mood for each environment and aspect of the story; I just wished that there was a larger variety of them when it was all said and done.The question that everyone has been asking when inquiring about Bound by Flame has been \"What is the combat system like?\"  To put it simply, I would describe it as being fun, strategic, and a little difficult if you are not paying close attention to what you are doing.  Bound by Flame is not a game where you can run into a large group of enemies and just hack-and-slash your way to victory with no second thought.  In fact, that is the easiest way to find yourself dying quicker than the amount of time it took you to run into them.Strategically using your assortment of combat abilities and weapons is the most vital aspect of winning against even the most mundane battles with mobs of weak Deadwalkers and beasts roaming the land.  You can freely choose between a sword, axe, hammer, daggers, a crossbow, explosive traps, and fire magic to help you get the upper hand on enemies.  Bound by Flame is packed full of different mob level enemies that all have different attack patterns and special abilities.  As you progress, you will have to learn their patterns and what weapons are most useful against them or accept your inevitable fate as becoming one of the undead.The strategy required to defeat the many different beasts and Deadwalkers increases tenfold when you encounter a boss fight.  Spiders did a great job when designing their terrifying set of bosses.  Each major boss fight was incredibly unique when compared to the previous boss you encountered.  Not only are each of them horrifyingly creepy looking, but they also all have different combat styles as well.  If you are anything like me, you will find yourself dying often each time you encounter a boss until you can finally develop a well-oiled strategy.  Often the most rewarding part of defeating a boss was the feeling of satisfaction from working out the perfect strategy.Based on how I described the combat system, you may think that it will be really hard, but that really isn't the case.  I have never been a fan of hard games, and Bound by Flame never felt like it was approaching that territory.  I always felt like I was just one second or one move away from figuring out how to kill each enemy or boss.  This caused me to immediately jump back in and try a different strategy until I could finally work it out.Armor and weapon customization will often determine whether you live or die in any given skirmish.  Bound by Flame has an incredibly deep loot system which lets you use just about any item you find to upgrade your equipment.  These upgrades will not only add statistic boosts like attack power or physical resistance, but they will also completely change the way that specific piece of equipment looks.  Needless to say, it was awesome to see Vulcan go from having raggedy amor in the beginning to looking like he could rule the world by the end.  Aside from the huge variety of cosmetic differences in weapons and armor, you will want to pay close attention to each statistic you are upgrading because some will prove to be your best weapon against certain enemies, while others will be your Achilles' Heel.The leveling system and skill trees are very straight forward and include no real surprises or innovation when compared to other RPGs.  Vulcan gains experience and levels up by defeating enemies.  After leveling up, you can choose to put skill points in any of the three available skill trees: a heavy weapon warrior skill tree, a dagger and crossbow ranger skill tree, and the Demon's fire magic skill tree.  On top of that, you will also have the ability to use an additional skill point on a passive skill that can improve things like how often you find ingredients or how much items will cost at a merchant.  Nothing really crazy stood out about the leveling or skill trees, but it was well done all the same.The Verdict: 9 out of 10Bound by Flame is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise crowded genre.  Spiders has achieved what many developers fail to ever do: creating a beautiful world with an incredibly deep/interesting history while also including a rock solid fun combat system.  Even though you can complete the main story and most of the sidequests in about 30 hours, many players will find themselves diving right back into the game to try and achieve the other two endings.  Bound by Flame was everything I wanted it to be and then some.  Spiders did an absolutely fantastic job and I hope that gamers will realize this so that we might see a sequel in the near future.  How do I sum up the entire game in just three words?  \"Go buy it.\"Courtney Osborn is the Founder and Editor in Chief at Middle of Nowhere Gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2014"}

I DOWNLOADED ALL BUT 3 OR THE DLC FOR THE GAME.The only DLC I didn't buy yet, is the Vampires and Werewolves DLC, the Firearms pack, and the Face, Triade, Police level up pack (or whatever it's official name).If your going to play the game, buy the Face, Triade, Police leveling up pack.  It will save you a lot of time.  I would have bought this pack, but I overlooked it.  If I play the game again, I'll buy it.Combat:  You are playing the character and have to fight within the character, he is not Batman or super human.  The character is human and you have to get used to fighting and get used to how he will, at times, reset himself and not respond to button mashing (he's resetting himself, recovering from being hit and perhaps catching his a couple of breaths).  You must get used to the timing.  Press the X button for a light attack, hold the X button for a heavy attack.  Press Y for a counter (be sure you time it right), B button to grab; grab then beat down; grab then throw to the ground.Advanced skills will have you X, (hold) X; X,X, (hold)X; or X,X, (hold) X, X, or X,X,X,X (hold)X.  It can be a challenge to get the timing right to get the skill that you want.  It seems like you can just X,X and hold the X button (instead of releasing and pressing and holding the X button) for the X, X, (hold) X, the same can be said for X,X,X (hold) X, and X,X,X,X (hold)X.  Other skills: sprint, grab X, spring grab, B, lock on press A to vault around the guy (as long as it's not blocked).  You can grab a guy and smash him into environmental obstacles; grab and sprint the guys head into obstacles, grab and put on a meat hook and into a saw blade for some latter missions.During combat, you'll have 3 guys at a minimum, to being surrounded by 8 guys at a time to battle with, and then sometimes more will join in.  It's hard not to button mash, but to be sure to get the skill you want, you need to hit the X button more slowly, but that's sometimes hard to do.GUNPLAY is fair.  You can take cover and you can slow down time for a few secons when you aim and vault over cover simultaneouslyYOU'LL DO MISSIONS FOR THE TRIADE GANG, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, FACE MISSIONS (these are races and favors), COP JOBS; and hijacking designated armored cars, escaping the police and returning it to a garage.Completing missions will level you up.  There is a Triad level system, a Police/Cop level system, and a Face level system.  They all have their unique upgrades your skills, ability, and health.  You're never in danger of blowing your undercover cop status during the game as advertised, at I never felt that way.The racing is okay.  The races will be in cars that you can choose from or others on a motorcycle.Favors can be riding shotgun and shooting approacHing enemies, driving as a wheelman get away driver, collecting money, ect, ect.The face missions are okay, nothing spectacular.The Cop Jobs are okay, brief, and nothing remarkable.  You kill off some guys and arrest the main criminal by grabbing him (press B) to put cuffs on him.  Sometimes you'll need to stop a car, sometimes you'll need to play sniper.You can also collect stolen statues to Sifu to learn new techniques.  For every five heath prayer stations you find, you'll get a 10% increase in health each time.  Drinking energy drinks, visiting aphothecary stores and drinking tea, and eating food from a vendor will either, increase damage given, reduce damage taken, or help in heath recovery. You must visit regularly.THE STORY IS COMPELLING.  DOING POLICE MISSIONS AND TRIAD MISSIONS ARE THE STORY AND MAIN PART OF THE GAME.THE MINI GAMES ARE SOME OF THE BEST: Cracking safes, planing bugs, entering security codes.  The rest of the gameplay is in between fair to good, but the mini-games are unique.Missions for the Triad and Police seem to one mission each before you get more main missions.  Then later in the game, you get police mission that are three-part, and you'll get several Triad missions back-to-back regardless of whether you complete the police missions.THE CUT SCEENS AND STORY ARE REALLY GOOD.  THE STORY KEEPS YOU HOOKED, BUT THE GAME PLAY AND NEVER REALLY LEADS TO ANY REALLY FULFILLING PAYOFF.  THE GAME NEVER GETS TO BE VERY FUN OF FULFILLING, BUT IT'S COMPELLING AND CHALLENGING, AND DISAPPOINTING WHEN YOU FAIL.  JUST TAKE ON HIT AT THE WRONG TIME AND IT'S OVER.  YOU HAVE TO START OVER.NICE ENDING.  HIS BOSS AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO DO THINGS HIS WAY, BUT YOUR CHARACTER (WEI CHEN, I THINK HIS NAME IS) DISAGREES AND DOES THINGS HIS WAY.  His boss double crosses him, and . . . nice ending.You can also break up drug busts all over the city.  There is usually 8 guys you must fight simultaneously and knock out.  Sometimes they are unarmed, sometimes they are armed.There are lock boxes to find which usually have money, but you have to knock out three guys (two skinny and one heavy).You can hack surveillance cameras, do surveillance and catch drug dealers at home--just okay.YOU GET BOTH A TRIAD AND POLICE BADGE RATING, WHICH TRANSLATE TO LEVELING UP POINTS, AFTER EACH MAIN MISSION.  Property damage, hurting or killing civilians, or steeling vehicles during a mission will reduce your police rating.  I'm not sure what reduces your Triad rating.  But, the less points you have deducted the faster you will level up and obtain more skills.SUMMARY:The racing is just okay, the gun fighting is just okay, the story is compelling and addicting, the game never gets very fulfilling or exciting.  You don't get a big payout in fun, fulfillment and satisfaction.The combat is challenging and a chore.

{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"The Best Console Ever","reviewText":"I purchased my 60gb PS3 on New Year's Day 2007 for $600.  Initially, it collected dust as most of the launch titles weren't that interesting (except for Resistance: Fall of Man).  I tended to go back to my 360 quite a bit so that I could play Gears of War (stunning).  At that time I was convinced that the 360 was the best console.  As time wore on, I ventured into blu-ray movies and began using my PS3 more and more.  The library of exceptional games for the PS3 increased and I began playing it more and more.  It's 2009 and my PS3 is now the #1 console in my home.  I rarely play my 360 anymore (RRoD, loud, multiplat games look and play just as good on the PS3, exclusives are more interesting) and my Wii is pretty much a joke.  I like being able to go back and play my old PS1 and PS2 games (especially Shadow of the Colossus) if I want.  They look pretty good on my big screen LCD via HDMI.  My blu-ray collection has increased dramatically since launch, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  The user interface is cleaner-looking and easier to use than the 360's.  The PSN is free as opposed to the 360's $50 annual fee for Xbox live.  Built-in wifi.  Four USB ports.  I can go on and on.  After all is said and done, I don't regret spending that ungodly $600.  My PS3 is still going strong.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Still my Inital Reason for Owning a PS3!","reviewText":"Back in 2008, my friends thought I was absolutely nuts for only wanting a Playstation 3 to own and play the conclusion to one of my favorite video game characters of all time; Solid Snake. It's 2012 now, I finally purchased a new PS3 with a bigger hardrive and I installed Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and started playing once again. 3 hours later, I've come to the decision that this game is still the masterpiece I remember it back then.The graphics get a 5 out of 5. The sound gets a 10/10. The game play gets a 100/100. The over all work of Hideo Kojima and the at the time development team at Konami just gets a #$%@ing Platinum medal, or deserves one. This game showed what the PS3 could do compared to the XB360 in terms of graphical power and massive content within Blu-Ray based games. And to tell you the truth, 3 to 4 years later, it still shows it.I personally think the current price for this game is outlandish, because it self is worth a full retail price for the sheer amount of content that is packaged into the Blu-ray disc. However, I understand because it's 3 to 4 years old now. The only and I mean ONLY people who would think other wise would be you avid Gears of War or Call of Duty fanboys or fangirls. Yes, I absolutely mean it. If you never enjoyed MGS 1, 2, or 3, stay the hell away, and go back to your 2 to 5 hour single player/built only for multiplayer games.However, if you were a MGS fan from the early days of the PS1, played the PS2 releases, and the PSP games, then this is the official magnum opus from the Metal Gear Solid franchise. The only complaint that I will point out against MGS4 are the cut scenes. They are long and there are many for a still confusing story. But this is what is expected when you play a Metal Gear Solid game. What still remains is one of the most innovative stealth action games money can buy. Just play with the Octocammo and see what I mean.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

Considering my +20 years of gaming experience that's no small statement.MGS4 has among the best graphics, sound and music of any game on consoles today.  The controls are functional, the voice acting is great, the pacing is perfect.Where MGS4 really shines is the story and the characters.  The entire Metal Gear saga is acknowledged, picked apart, and fused expertly into an epic tale that entertains every step through.  The characters are phenomenal, I loved seeing old favorites appear, and was pleasantly surprised to see others I totally didn't expect.  There's action, humor, drama, terror, surprises...everything you could want in a cinematic game.  MGS4 shows incredible detail in every facet of it's being, rivaling most major Hollywood films in overall quality.  The effort put forth here is staggering.  You get the impression the developers poured their hearts and souls into it.  On a side note, perhaps due to my oversensitivity, the music during the final end credits actually made me weep.If I HAD to take issue with anything, perhaps it would be the characters' facial expressions; they're a little flat.  You'll notice they emote a little, but it's clear developers haven't totally mastered the art of moving hi-res model faces enough to convey convincing passion...yet.  I only noticed it because everything else is so perfect.  Also, the game is a little short, but that's in stride with the other games in the series.  When you're taking your time through it (which you should) the game doesn't feel short.Thus far, Metal Gear Solid 4 is my reason for owning a PlayStation3.  If you enjoy games of epic quality it'll be yours, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9X9W","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Love the new controller!","reviewText":"I've been looking forward to holding the DualShock 4 since E3, because while holding a controller attached to a demo unit on a crowded showfloor is one thing, having it in the comfort of your home is another. In fact, I spent ten minutes just switching back and forth between the DualShock 3 and 4, just to see how much improved the new controller is. Of course, I would do this before I had to review a PlayStation 3 game. Which is a shame, because the DualShock 3 feels like a boxy toy compared to its successor. It's like getting new glasses: your old ones feel fine, until you've tried the new ones on.The DualShock 4 feels slightly thinner and longer than the DS3, but the new handgrips are larger and feel far more comfortable in my huge hands. The analog sticks are tighter than they were on the DS3, with a feeling of resistance approaching a 360 controller. Sony has made sticks slightly shorter and added a dip in the center of each one so your thumbs won't slip off. The button click on the analog sticks is not a deep as the DualShock 3, but still noticeable. The new directional pad has a more pronounced dip in the center that draws your thumb there naturally, but otherwise it feels like the same single piece rocker that we've had since the first PlayStation controller.As Sony confirmed months ago, the face buttons are digital instead of analog this time; no one really used them for analog purposes, so it saves data bandwidth to switch them back to digital. They're closer together on the DualShock 4, making a tighter diamond shape.&#34;With the DualShock 3, we were able to get analog data, which games didn't really use,&#34; Sony Computer Entertainment product planning manager Toshimasa Aoki told VentureBeat last week. &#34;For DualShock 4, we deleted that, and now it's all digital. The mechanism inside is a little different, and the data that games get is different.&#34;The R1 and L1 buttons are a little rounder, while the R2 and L2 trigger have undergone a complete redesign. The triggers are now concave instead of convex; my fingers fell right into place as soon as I picked up the DualShock 4. Even outside of general use, the concave triggers have a second benefit: fewer accidental button presses when you set down the controller, since it now rests on the edge of triggers. R2 and L2 on the DualShock 3 have a sense of greater resistance and springy-ness as they reach their full press, but on the DS4 it's smooth all the way through. As a tiny bonus the names on the top buttons actually face toward you when you're using the controller.To charge your DualShock 3 you used a mini-USB cable, but the DualShock 4 switches to micro-USB. So if you've purchased a non-Apple portable electronic device in the past four years, you're probably good to go. The controller itself does not come with a micro-USB cable, but one will come with the PlayStation 4. I have a ton of them lying around the house, so I grabbed one and plugged it into my PC to see what would happen.My Windows 8.1 PC did recognize the controller as a generic USB controller with a total of fourteen buttons: Square, X, Circle, Triangle, L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3, Share, Options, the PS button, and the click of the touchpad. The touchpad itself doesn't register and the D-Pad comes up as the &#34;point of view hat&#34;, like a flight stick. Oddly enough, the L2 and R2 triggers show up as buttons and change X and Y Rotation in Windows settings. The controller can also be reportedly be paired to a PC with Bluetooth, but I was unable to test that as my motherboard lacks a Bluetooth connection. Fun fact: the controller LED glows amber when hooked into a PC.I tried it out with a few PC games, but the results weren't all that great. Saints Row IV saw the controller and everything worked... except for the fact that the analog stick was inverted. Pushing down on the stick would make my character more forward and vice versa. There was no way to fix this using the in-game menus. Batman: Arkham City and Far Cry 3 were complete non-starters and neither game recognized the controller at all. Adult Swim's Soundodger worked fine. If you're getting this as a PC controller, I'd say your best bet is to wait. Sony needs to release some PC drivers for the DualShock 4 and I hear they're busy launching a console.All in all, I think Sony has done a great job with the new DualShock. It's a marked improvement over the DualShock 3, but I'll need more time with an actual game in order to deliver my final verdict. That said Sony's off to a great start, and in previous demos, I've preferred the DualShock 4 to the Xbox One controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Shadow \"Chaos Control\"","summary":"EXCELLENT OF THE BEST","reviewText":"This game just arrived the other night ' i played it and i noticed it has a opening cinema but MP5 did not ' so after going to story mode i was realize this game is more better then MP5 because you dont half to complete against those annoying koopa kids :)But some mini games are still hard like on MP5 and story mode reminds me of Party mode on MP4 ' this game is so much fun you can also have fun playing with the game with your friendsProsOpening CinemaCool Music and voice actingNice board game levelsConsSome Mini games are hard making it kinda impossible to be party star in the gameOverall its still a fun game ' so buy this game you wont regret it :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2004"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Fun and Frustrating","reviewText":"This is a fun but unforgiving game.Monster Hunter Tri (3) was my first forray into the Monster Hunter series.  From what I can gather, Monster Hunter is a franchise with a small, cult following.  This isn't Halo or Call of Duty.  Being the third game in the series, it suffers from some accessibility problems for new players looking to jump in.  It's hard, but not impossible.The instruction manual and game tutorials are very basic, and frankly rather unhelpful.  You'll get a pretty decent grasp on how to move around, navigate the menus, and attack.  What you don't get is detailed information on how to perform combos, choose armor, collect items, and craft items.  These are gameplay aspects that are crucial to succeed at the game.  Even as a veteran gamer, it was somewhat overwhelming trying to figure out how to choose from the plethora of armor choices or how to figure out what the different skills do and how they are activated.  So if you're new to the series, be prepared to invest some time on the Internet reading Monster Hunter websites, wikis, game guides, etc. in order to figure out how to play the game.OK, so let's assume you know how to play the game.  Now prepare for a clunk-fest.  The gameplay is decidedly clunky.  Your character is rather sluggish, which will get very annoying very fast when you have giant monsters barreling down at you at unforgiving speeds.  Case in point: whenever you use a health potion, your idiot character finds it necessary to chug the potion, then unnecessarily flex in a healthy looking manner before allowing you to regain control over his movements.  While your idiot character is flexing, a giant monster WILL pummel him, often with a hit brutal enough to completely negate the effects of the potion.The fighting styles are similarly sluggish.  This is more RPG than God of War or Assassin's Creed.  My weapon of choice is the lance, which is a weapon for turtles.  It is a weapon class that features a shield, and the fighting style involves (very slowly) engaging in a defensive stance, waiting for an opening, and (very slowly) withdrawing your shield and (very slowly) poking back at the monster.  The (very slowly) bits will infuriate you.  You will often be brutally counter-attacked in the seemingly endless delay between finishing an attack and returning to a defensive stance with your shield up.Another frustrating aspect of the game is that you cannot grind levels to make yourself stronger.  Your character's fighting prowess is based entirely on the equipment he/she wears.  The strength of your equipment is, to some extent, capped based on the level of monster you can kill.  You improve your equipment by carving or capturing monsters, yielding the ingredients necessary to upgrade your weapons and armor.  So there is some measure of frustration when you can't figure out how to kill a particular monster because it's not as if you can grind levels for a few hours and come back 10 levels higher with more HP, more attack power, or more mana to tip the scales in your favor.  If you're going to get by, you're going to have to level up your gameplaying skills, not your character.So far, my review sounds brutally negative.  Why 4/5 stars?  Because, in the end, I found the game to be very fun.  You'll have to accept the sluggish gameplay for what it is.  The game is meant to be more strategic than twitch-control.  Why do you flex after drinking a health potion?  Because you can choose to invest skill points in a skill that speeds up your recovery times.It's the weapon and armor crafting that make the game addictive.  I don't know why.  I spend many waking hours thinking about the next weapon or armor piece I'm going to make, and figuring out which monsters I need to hunt to obtain the ingredients.  Then I'm online reading strategies on how to kill the monsters I need to kill.This game will not appeal to everyone.  It is a timesink.  This is a game for the MMORPG players who like to grind their way to the top for no other reason than to have the best equipment in the game.  The World of Warcraft players who grinded their way to level 85, spend XXX hours raiding dungeons to get the Tier XXX equipment sets.  There is no real story to the game.  It eventually becomes much like Diablo 2, and the only reason you're playing is to find more Stones of Jordan or HoZ or Zod runes to complete the ultimate equipment set to show off to your friends.  I spend some of my off time perusing the Monster Hunter wiki, jotting down a list of items I have to find to craft the next great lance, and jotting down the list of monsters I have to hunt to get the ingredients I need.  And after collecting those ingredients?  Time to build the next greater lance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

That is the only issue I have with Sony and these controllers. Who can play from 3ft away while these are charging? It might work on a smaller TV, but when I'm playing on my big screen, this wasn't an option. I picked up a longer cable so that wasn't a problem. You just need a USB to mini-B cable. They come in many lengths so pick up the length you need. I picked up two 15-footers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Obviously, this had to be rectified, and so I jumped on Amazon to order me a game pad.I was presented with two options! One being to pick up a generic game pad, and the second being to grab an official game pad! I decided the smartest thing to do, was go official! Yes, the generic ones were much MUCH cheaper, but I have used generic gamepads in the past for other systems, and let's just say they were never a good experience.I got it home and it worked as intended. It has the rumble feeling that you either love or you hate, and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand!It looks like previous versions of the Dual shock controllers, so is obviously a format you are most likely familiar with, and while it DOES look like the same pad used on the PS2, this is completely different and will NOT be compatible for the PS2, this is for the PS3, However if you are playing PS1 or PS2 games on your PS3 console, this will still work!Overall, I firmly believe that this is the best PS3 console controller available on the market.

Full color portable gaming is an awesome advance, but Game Boy Color does more than improve the appearance of your games. Game Boy Color is twice as fast as the regular Game Boy, which allows programmers to crunch more data and produce more sophisticated games. For you, this means faster action, more advanced AI, and increased realism. But you don't have to go out and buy all new games to enjoy playing in color! You can play any of the 450 original Game Boy titles, and Game Boy Color will transform them to color from black and white! When you put a pre-existing Game Boy game into Game Boy Color, you will be able to choose from one of twelve default color palettes on the Game Boy Color start-up screen. New games designed specifically for Game Boy Color are sharper and even more vivid than colorized black and white games, with a full spectrum palette of more than 32, 000 colors. Game Boy Color is compatible with both the Game Boy Camera and the Game Boy Printer.","reviewerName":"M.

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"S.

In this case, it's the fourth. Course, there's a good explanation why. I set out looking for Final Fantasy I&II;: Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alot of twists and turns & is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games.Although they tweaked the graphics, translation and whatnot abit, they pretty much made the game as it was originally. I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2006"}

I have been an avid Halo and Gears player for years, but became tired of the lack of team play. I bought this game specifically for online play and have not tried the campaign, my review focuses on online only.At first, I hated the game. I did not like dying after a few hits and was ready to return it. However, I went online read reviews and learned this game is about teamwork, not running and gunning. It is also critical to use cover to your advantage. I tried it again with this in mind and I must say after six hours of gameplay logged, I love it. The game is based around strategy and team work. The experience is even better when you get a squad of friends together. I enjoy the different classes and earning new equipment. The game is also ment to be played with surround sound, the audio is incredible.What I do not like are the glitches with online play. Even though I make a squad, half the games end up with my squad mates being placed on the opposing team, which is very annoying. They need add something you can select that will keep your squad together or not register you in that game. There has also been issues with dropped games from the server, which then penalizes you for quitting. I marked a star off for these things, but I am hoping this is something EA will address very soon, many complaints about it in the forums.This game is not for everyone and very difficult if you are new to dying with only a couple of shots, it is not Halo. However, if you have a good group of friends for a squad and like strategy and objectives-you will probably enjoy this game. My K/D is pathetic at best, but I have been rewarded greatly for completing objectives, which I like very much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Excellent old-school action RPG!","reviewText":"While SMT:N has a storyline that is a tad controversial due to it's strange take on Christianity and other-worldly religions, it takes a stealar apparoach on old RPG principles and builds on them! The game features an interesting turn based combat system with \"button press icons\", which diminish as you take a turn. If you manage to score a critical hit or use an enemey's weakness though, you only use up one half of a turn press icon, so in theory you can end up going twice as many turns per round in combat (and possibly never let your oppoenent take a turn if you manage to kill them before your turns are used up!) The press turn system works for your opponent in the same way though, so look out. A down side to this revamped 'old fashioned' combat system though is that if your main character dies, you lose. This is an old rpg rule that many can probably recall in games from the past.The heart of the game though is the monster/demon creation/recruitment system. Throughout the game, you will encounter tons of different monsters, of all shapes and sizes. Each of them have different combonations of strengths, weaknesses, skills and abilities. To obtain them, you will have to either recruit them in combat via negotiation, purchase them from vendors, or fuse your old monsters to create new ones in the Cathedral of Shadows (which is what you will probably end up doing most of the time in the end.)The game states that it has over 55 hours of gameplay, but you could easily go into the 100's if you end up looking for all of the extra content in the game. In order to obtain the added ending in this 'director's cut' version of the game, you will have to embark on some rather lengthy side quests and also will have to create a tremendously powerful party if you are to ever have a hope of battling the awsome final boss that the game has hidden away. Definently a fun challange for those who have patience.This game features a wonderful soundtrack, which eminates techno, rock, metal, and ambient tunes. It is mostly upbeat, and it's sound effects are also very well placed in. Sadly, there is no voice acting, but it helps out in the end with the 'old school' feel that the game has. The graphics are also wonderful, as they are done in a unique and un-childish cell-shaded manner the likes of which I have never seen until now.Another positive is that the game features Dante from the Devil May Cry series, whom many gamers will probably be familiar with (as was I. In fact, he was the main reason I bought the game!)SMT:Nocturne is a rare game, and it will be hard to come by at a price under $50 dollars, but believe me, it is very well worth the price of admission if you are looking for a GOOD RPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2005"}

If you do want Live Points, my advice is to purchase them through Amazon.There are a few reasons to do so:* If you are an Amazon customer and have already given your credit card number to Amazon, why put it out one more place, such as giving it to Microsoft?  Especially in light of the recent hacking of personal information on the Playstation, it makes sense to limit distribution of your credit card info.* The Amazon price s typically a few cents less than buying the points elsewhere.  This card is not as good a value as the 4,000 point card, but obviously you might want to buy the lower point card for a variety of reasons.* You do not need to order this as a physical card, as an on-line code version is available.  Of course, if giving this as a gift, a physical card may be desirable.Again, the 4,000 point card is a better value \"per point\" but you may want to start with this card if you are a new user and want to see if you like what the points have to offer, or if you are giving someone a small gift, or if you just have less funds available or don't need more than 1,600 points.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2011"}

It felt too sparse for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Better than ever","reviewText":"God of War and God of War II were definitely two of the best, original games ever created for the PS2.  They were challenging, violent, incredibly fun, intelligent, and featured graphics that not only pushed the PS2 to its limits, but may in fact have been the best looking games to ever appear on the system.  Now, here we are with the God of War Collection for the PS3, which features God of War I & II re-mastered and re-vitalized for the console.  Needless to say, the games look even more fantastic in HD, and play just as well and wonderful as they always have before.  If you don't already own or have never played either game on the PS2, then you need to, at the very least, give the God of War Collection a try, and even if you have played the games before, playing them again in HD on the PS3 is certainly worth taking another revenge-driven trip with Kratos.  The only flaw here is that playing both games will leave you drooling for God of War III, which can't arrive here soon enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2009"}

Of course, fans of the first would expect nothing less. I'm pleased to say Dead Space 2 is no less of a thrill than the first. The graphics are incredible, the sound and music are very atmospheric, and the enemies are even more grotesque and much more deadly than the first bout. The years haven't been kind to Isaac and you can witness that first hand as he's losing his mind throughout the game. He shows a lot more character in this game and I can definitely see Isaac becoming a favorite character among video game junkies. The story is a great follow up and the gameplay doesn't stray too far from the original formula which was perfectly fine in my opinion. Plenty of scares and plenty of moments that make your jaw drop.My one minor problem with Dead Space 2, and it's entirely subjective, is the difficulty. I played the game on Normal and for the most part it played that way, until I got to the end. The last chapters in the game had me pulling my hair out in parts. The fact that it all happens at the end makes things even more frustrating since you know you're SO close. I played the original Dead Space on Normal and thought the difficulty was perfectly balanced but Dead Space 2 had me swearing in parts.To sum it up, the difficulty curve got incredibly high at the end but Dead Space fans will love this sequel. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who can't handle VERY intense, horrific games/movies.PROS:- Great graphics- Great Sound FX/Music- Great story and voice acting- Very IntenseCONS:- Much more difficult than the firstTIP: If you want to live long in this game you better beef up that stasis module my friend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

I didn't want to get the 250gb glossy Xbox 360 slim because I've had annoying experiences with my PS3 and how fingerprints and dust really are drawn to the glossy surface. This, though, is perfect, especially if you're anal about things like that just like me.This is the Xbox 360 that Microsoft should be proud of. It's everything that'll satisfy a new Xbox 360 purchaser, and if you've been holding out, now's your chance to see what all the buzz is about.For $200, you're getting an amazing deal, especially when compared to the older \"phat\" models of the Xbox 360:- Smaller system, hence the nickname \"slim.\"- Sleeker/sexier. I think this is pretty self explanatory. Just look at them both side by side.- MUCH quieter. When Microsoft says \"whisper quiet,\" they mean it. Especially if you install your games so the disk doesn't even spin.- Extremely high reliability increase compared to the 5 year old Xenon phat models, and even the reliable Jasper phat models. This is because of the 45nm combined cpu/gpu die, which is dubbed the Valhalla chipset. Jasper model phats were renown for being reliable and breaking the dreaded 3RROD curse that plagued older models, because they used a 65nm chipset. This Valhalla chipset is even better. Not to mention that, just like a Mac or a PS3, the console will shutdown if overheating, preventing damage to the console. Mines is usually on 12+ hours a day and I haven't had any problems.-Built in WiFi-N. Microsoft finally added wifi to their console, and to make up for it not being in the phat models, they went all out and made it wifi-N, which is the fastest wifi on any console available today. About time!-4gb internal flash memory, which can hold about 4000 game saves. It's enough for some DLC here and there and maybe an arcade game or two, but the best part is that it's a major upgrade from the original phat arcades, which only had 256MB of flash memory. This is MORE then enough memory for a casual user, or a kid who only uses memory to save games. If, however, you want to do more like download a lot of things, you can buy a standalone 250gb HDD around next month and simply slide it in. Technically, you'll have 254gb of memory if you do it that way.- 5 USB slots. If you have a random USB lying around the house, just stick it in for more memory! 4gb flash memory and two 16gb cheap flash drives = 36gb of memory!- Kinect ready, meaning it has a port in the back solely for Kinect. If you have a phat Xbox 360, you'll need to plug Kinect into a power outlet on the wall.- Touch sensitive buttons, which is a neat bonus.All in all, for $200, this deal can't be beat for what it offers. Whether you're looking to buy an Xbox for Halo: Reach or Gears of War 3, or want to try out Dance Central, or are buying it for a younger person for such games as Kinectimals, you're in for a treat either way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2010"}

It is easy, it has games they can play, and it comes with buzzers that allow up to four players to hop in an begin mashing buttons. It is also easy - the target for the game seems to say that right away - and there are hours to be had for someone too little to kick it into the big game range. As far as the rest of the family -  I've always hated the \"fun for the whole family\" tag because it means this is a title that little kids enjoy, big kids don't really love, older kids find distasteful, and adults just wonder about. We have headsets that we can wear, multiplayer games that support armadas of players, and this comes on the heels of a faltering system. So, it really isn't the connectivity prize it claims when it says it is for all age ranges.For adults:Good for adult parties - you can't handle complex things like driving or operating a glass so you might like this.Good when you suffer from insomnia - sleepless enough makes you appreciate almost anything.Good for when you want an electronic babysitter (just let the little ones have friends over).To recap, it works for the age range BUT 10 and UP is not really accurate.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

You can basically set your squad AI to automatic and not worry about details, or not, and you spend the effort to control their actions.  This gives two different combat styles for sure aside from the different character types.No crashes, no slowdowns.  A mature game.  I ran it on windows 7 and although the launcher craps out, the game plays fine and you can set things in the game so it is not clear why the launcher is even needed.  It even plays without the CD in the drive (nice) so I am not sure where the comments about DRM come from.  It may be there but I never saw it.Lots of side quests to pump up your character(s).  You can put as much or little effort into them as you like.  It is not clear to me what the \"find stuff\" quests are for.

Unfortunatley, I had to wait sveral months later on my 7th birthday and I immediatley popped this sucker into the NES and was warped into a adventure of my own.  Super Mario 3 is the first two Mario games morphed into one ultimate package and then it was injected with steriods because this game is a supernatural high!  The bosses were King Koopa's 7 kids who guarded 7 ships after turning one king into 7 different animals on 7 different occasions and its up to Mario and Luigi to hop, jump, fly, swim, shoot, and hammer their way through 7 different worlds to obtain 7 different wands to save the king from the 7 kooplings.  Just when you thought defeated all the kooplings, King Koopa himself sends you a message that he kidnapped Princess Toadstool at his castle in the Dark World (the 8th world).  Who knew that a Mario game would have a magic leaf that turns Mario into a racoon that allows him to fly over a short period of time or a hammer brother suit that allows Mario to shoot mulitple hammers that inflicts more damage than a fireball.  You also get a inventory of items (obtained from Toad's house or from a chest in random parts of the game) from fire flowers to a P Wing (allows Mario to fly past the entire board when things get reall rough down below).

{"product_name":"B001BR95PW","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"You can find better","reviewText":"I acquired this headset whenSOCOM: Confrontationwas first released and thought I was getting a deal by getting the game AND the headset for about $60.  I couldn't have been more wrong.As headsets go, I have worn a LOT of them.  I've owned old-fashioned wired headsets, pre-bluetooth wireless that communicated with a little receiver you clipped to your belt and plugged into your phone, and of course... plenty of bluetooth sets.Let me start by saying that you do NOT need this headset for a PlayStation3.  In theory, ANY bluetooth headset will work with a PS3.  (Granted some won't because bluetooth is inherently buggy technology.)  Likewise, this headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone.  However, my personal preference is to have separate headsets because I don't like pairing and unpairing all the time.Having said that, let's talk about this headset.  It is about as basic as basic gets.  If all you need is basic, more power to you, but you'll find similar quality for less money with other sets. Try theJabra BT4010, which as of this writing sells for half the price of the Sony.  Heck, you can even find $10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to go cheap!Apart from poor value, the Sony set is an awkward fit.  It has only a thin rubber ring around a little plastic \"barrel\" that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear.  Most other sets either have a \"form-fitted\" rubber piece or simply stay out of your ear altogether.  This design gets uncomfortable quickly because A) the part that goes in your ear may not be the right size for your ear and B) the over-the-ear loop is made of cheap plastic as opposed to being rubber or having a rubber coating like many other sets.The battery life is decent, but nothing to write home about.  And the charging stand? It's cheap, very lightweight plastic that falls over very easily.  If the USB cable is a little bit stiff, the natural tendency for it to curl may very well topple the stand.As for sound quality... yeah, basic again.  Sure, it works, but once again it is very basic.  I felt like it didn't have a very good range of volume.  Many times I had it cranked to the max and still could barely hear.Since games are usually $60 and this headset came bundled inside a $60 game, I tried hard to find a reason to keep it, after all wasn't it \"free\"?  In the end, I could find no redeeming qualities and returned it rather than allowing it to take up space in a drawer somewhere.If you'd like some good places to start your search for another headset, here are a few:Personally, I just can't get over theJabra FreeSpeak BT250V.  It's so comfortable I don't even notice it's there and it also has a vibrating/call notification feature, which is absolutely great for leaving your phone on the charger and keeping the headset with you at home or office.  As of this writing, the Sony is ~$45 and the Jabra is ~$60.  You may find the Jabra cheaper but even at $60 it's DEFINITELY a better value than the Sony!If you're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. for listening to music), I've been really happy with theMotorola HT820.  It has two speakers and wraps around the back of your head/neck.  Fair warning, though- the Motorola sounds awesome but the speakers are huge and wearing this set makes you look like a total dork.There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of bluetooth headsets out there so no matter which one you finally choose, please just don't make it this Sony piece of junk.  Your dollars will go farther on something with the same quality/lower price, or same price/higher quality.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2009"}

RE newbies will find an enjoyable adventure here, but veterans will find it to be treading on very familiar ground. Veterans of the series already know what to expect: monster-blasting action crossed with brain-twisting puzzles, and it does not deviate from that formula either. The narrative follows survival/horror franchise pros Claire/Chris Redfield travel from a desert island to a secret Arctic base; both locales are, of course, densely populated by zombies and mutated monsters thanks in part to the G-virus, T-virus (or whatever they seem to be calling it these days). Veronica X delivers a solid stream of shocks and surprises, although some story elements are awkward as the games title puncuation. After a couple of &quot;romantic&quot; interludes between Claire and an island prisoner named Steve, you'll yearn for the no-nonsense style of Jill Valentine and RE3. One of the prime selling points of the game is additional cinematics that weren't in the DC version of the game.

One of the great improvements fromGrand Theft Auto IIIto VC was its licensed soundtrack. Also to compare,Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Storieshad most of the original GTA3 radio with a few new songs and a new channel. For this game they only kept the worst VC channel, the Latin channel and nearly all the new music, outside of maybe two songs, is awful.The GTA series has never really been about the story, but the laughably bad cut scenes fall flat in this one. It doesn't help that the voice acting is terrible and the characters are almost all annoying one-dimensional stereotypes.Vice City had a number of things, like the full map or motorcycles, which the original GTA3 did not. So GTA:LCS with those improvements was a better game. In this game you can swim, but it isn't a huge part of the game. Honestly this isn't really much of an improvement.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Plus some of the minigames can be annoying and some parts are a lot more frustrating than the first one.  The first one was great, a little challenging yet easy to beat, and plus it was highly addictive.

Then again, the latest models for the old design 360s have been much more reliable with the RROD being a non-issue unlike in previous models.  This new \"slim\" model couldn't be any worse and if I do run into problems, there is always an edit button for this review.Now why should you buy this updated model?  Well it comes down to your individual situation and how important having the latest and greatest is to you.  I personally had a 2007 20 Gig unit which had already been struck with the RROD once before.  My warranty was up in a few months, my HDD was painfully limited on space, I had no HDMI port, and the unit was extremely loud.  It was only a matter of time before it had to be replaced anyway, and with Gamestop having a special trade in deal (best trade in offer they have probably ever had) it made sense to upgrade, for me.The \"360 S\", as it is described by MS, has immediate benefits over older models:Looks - The system looks much better in person than it does in a 2D picture, slideshow or even video.  You really have to see this thing to appreciate it's beauty.  Now this is all subjective, but I think most people will agree that it looks better in person and in your entertainment center than it does in photos.  The glossy piano black finish is quite attractive, though it can be a scratch and smudge magnet if you are not careful.  Matte black is probably better for consoles but I'm not going to complain since it looks great.  The silver/chrome trim is pure eye candy and goes well with the black finish.  The curves and angles of the system are subtle and sexy making for an attractive console whether it rests vertically or horizontally.  The controller is all black, unlike old elite controllers where the analog sticks were gray, and the guide button is chrome.  The headset is also black, and looks very slick compared to the cheap piece of plastic packed in with previous units.  MS went all out with the black here, the system is so dark in fact that it practically disappears when the lights are off, this is not a positive or a negative, just an observation.Size - The official number is that the 360 S is 17% smaller than the preceding models.  It looks even smaller than that when you finally get it home.  It is easily smaller than both the original PS3 and the PS3 slim, though not as tiny and compact as the Wii.  It will fit nice and snug into any entertainment center.Function - First thing you will notice when unpacking your system for the first time are the vents.  MS is not kidding with ventilation to prevent overheatng, there are two intakes, one on the top and one on the bottom, and an exit vent on the right side (when vertical, top when horizontal).  Hot air is pushed out with such prejudice that I advise you not have any other devices resting to the right of the console if it is vertical and leave plenty of breathing room up top if placed horizontal.  These vents work, the system stays cool and if it were to overheat there is a fail safe where the system shuts itself off and goes into \"cooling mode\".  When in cooling mode, there will be a message on screen which explains what it is doing so you don't have a heart attack thinking you just got some more faulty MS hardware (admit it, we're all a little jumpy when it comes to MS hardware issues).  I have not personally witnessed this cool down mode, I have simply read of it's existance and seen evidence.  I have put in a number of marathon gaming sessions on my new 360 S and it runs cool to the touch.Speaking of touch, the push buttons have been replaced by touch buttons.  These buttons are quite sensitive, I only had to wave my finger in front of them to get a response.  I didn't even touch the system and the disc tray opened, I thought the thing was sentient for a second and knew what I wanted.  The power button is pretty sensitive as well and there is this satisfying chime that goes off when you activate these buttons.  Now I am not sure if the sensitivity will dull over time, but they do seem a little too sensitive so keep your cats away from your system so you don't have your game ejected on you in the middle of play.The immediate benefits with this system are the 250 Gig hard drive, built in 2.4 GHz WiFi and a portal for the upcoming Kinect.  The hard drive is a huge bonus for me, now I can finally install games, rip music, download and watch videos and dive into XBLA like a fat man at a buffet.  I feel so...liberated!  WiFi is not a big deal to me as I prefer a hardline connection when online gaming, but it is certainly a welcome option.  Some people have complained that the WiFi is not 5 GHz like the previous adapter but in all honesty, the 5GHz range is much more limited than the 2.4 and the whole reason to use WiFi, as I see it, is for the range.  The built in WiFi is also claimed to be the fastest yet by MS and various gaming sites such as IGN.  Then there is Kinect, which I am undecided on.  I really need a price before I can make any decisions and I doubt I will be an early adopter, but if it releases more games like Child of Eden (spiritual successor to the hypnotic music shooter REZ), then I will have no problem picking up a unit for the right price.  Maybe Kinect is not a day one purchase, but who wouldn't want to go all Lawnmower Man/Minority Report on their dashboard with hands free navigation and voice recognition?  If these features are incorporated into games (without replacing the controller, just supplementing it) that are not shovelware, I will be interested.  Not having to buy any kind of adapter for Kinect, an adapter you just know MS is going to overprice, is a welcome bonus.Noise - The most immediate gratification you will get from the 360 S is it's whisper quiet sound.  Whisper quiet is a perfectly accurate description, practically everyone who has this model uses that term as soon as they turn it on.  Whisper quiet does not mean completely silent, it means that you can't hear it unless you are listening specifically for it.  This means turning everything else off in the room, and this is with a disc in the tray.  If the system is idle or if a game is installed, it's even quieter.  It is easily quieter than the PS3 Slim and almost on par with Wii levels of silence.  The noise of my old Xbox never really got to me because I play with a surround sound gaming headset (Tritton AxPros) but after hearing how quiet this system is, I can certainly understand the appeal of silence compared to what once sounded like an airplane taking off mixed in with a V-twin at full throttle.As mentioned, I got a good deal on this new system at Gamestop.  Is it worth the full 300?  That depends on your situation and what you want.  There are some great deals on the previous Elite models right now and if you have no interest in a hard drive (I suggest everyone get one though) then perhaps you may want to pick up an Arcade for half the price.  There is also a rumored entry level 360 S to be released this fall for 100 bucks cheaper, not sure if it will have a HDD or not, it most certainly won't have built in WiFi.  For anyone who has an older unit which is about to be out of warranty and has a 60 gig HDD or less, I'd say this is worth the upgrade if you truly want it.  It is certainly a fine piece of hardware, the best hardware MS has ever released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

In short, this is a phenomenal game with a great story, splendid graphics, top tier voice acting and an all around work of art created by true industry professionals. This may very well be Naughty Dog's masterpiece.)I'm going to be upfront with you and tell you that I have not finished this game yet. If your trust in my review absolutely depends on that little tidbit of info, I'll understand if you decide to dismiss my review altogether. I literally had to say something about this game because it's been at the forefront of my mind for the past few days. Even after only playing halfway through the game, I'd be kidding not only you but myself if I didn't give it a full five stars.If you're reading this review, most likely you've already decided on whether or not you're going to pick this game up. What I can tell the few of you who are still on the fence about purchasing it is that from the very beginning of the game, you'll already know that you're going to get your money's worth. The beginning sequence alone is worth the cost of the game and I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that the intro may possibly be the single best opening to a game I have ever experienced. On one hand, you've seen it all before in similarly themed movies where a nationwide pandemic begins and there's that slow realization that things are going downhill and fast. The only difference is, this time you're involved in the scene yourself, controlling the characters and responding to things that are happening before you. It's incredibly intense and unsettling. To say anymore would be a shame, so that's all I'm going to say on that.The world of the main characters is so defined that I can't even begin to describe it. It all just feels.... authentic. The graphics are amazing. The level of detail on display here is so impressive that as of right now it's easily one of the best looking games on the PS3, ever. The voice acting is top tier and the mannerisms of the characters give them all a sense of individuality. The animations on the main characters are so refined that it's unbelievable. If you really pay attention, you'll notice the tiny nuances in all of their actions that wind up making them feel so much more lifelike. And it's all seamless as they perform one action after another. The only other game that I can think of at this point that had animation this impressive was Max Payne 3.The sound design is even better and if you have a decent surround sound set up, you are in for quite a treat. The only other games that I can think of that compares in terms of the sound are the Dead Space titles, which used sound to really put you into the game. The result you get with The Last of Us can only be described as lush. They really did a good job in that regard and created a sound scape that when coupled with the visuals, makes for an immersive experience that will surely impress you. When the various forms of zombies start to make their appearance, that's where the surround sound really shines. My wife was watching me play one sequence that had me avoiding a group of 'clickers' (zombies who search for their prey using echolocation) and she left the room because it was simply too intense as I bobbed and weaved behind cover and shadows, trying to exit the area undetected.The controls are well balanced and the inventory system is well thought out. Combat is brutal and does a good job of reminding you that violence can be truly ugly when situations become desperate enough. Pickups, ammo and weapons are scarce adding to the overall air of desperation that you will be sure to feel. This is a game that really does a good job of selling the grimness of an end of the world scenario, more so than most other games I've played.As I said before, at the time of this writing, I have yet to beat the game. What I've played so far is apparently only scratching the surface from what I've heard from friends and gathered from various reviews. I normally don't jump the gun on writing a review for a title but trust me when I tell you that the game is absolutely astounding and a sure contender for Game of the Year once December rolls around. Once you play that beginning portion, you'll know that you made the right choice in picking this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"A different take on Castlevania","reviewText":"Probably one of the most recognizable video game franchises in the entire gaming industry, Castlevania has had an installment on virtually every system from NES to present day.  It hasn't always been a smooth road for this franchise...legendary installments like Symphony of the Night stand out most in people's memory, whereas poor entries like Castlevania 64 are among those that people would very much like to forget.  With Lords of Shadow, the series takes a considerable sidestep to the franchise and offers up a rather new experience in the series.The Story:For the first time, Hideo Kojima steps in and takes some creative direction with Castlevania, bringing the storytelling to new heights.  With exceptional voice acting from Patrick Stewart, every cutscene and introduction to each level is narrated or voiced to perfection.  Players follow the quest of Gabriel Belmont to avenge his murdered wife and bring an end to the apparent spell that has cut off the people of this world from Heaven and God.  To do so, Gabriel must confront the Lords of Shadow, 3 supreme evil beings who are directly responsible for the chaos plaguing the world.  Along the way, Gabriel will meet new allies and experience troubling visions alluding to his destiny.  With some shocking plot twists and a surprise after-the-credits ending, the story itself does not disappoint, though it may be somewhat confusing to those who have followed Castlevania for the past 20 years.Gameplay:LoS has been compared to God of War many times over, but I heartily disagree with such a statement.  If anything, I think this development team spent a lot of time playing Shadow of the Colossus.  There are 3 segments in the game that are pretty much blatant rip offs of Colossus.  Sure, the game is from the third person with pre-set viewpoints and camera angles, but the gameplay is vastly different from God of War.  It shares some similarities, and the fundamentals of typical Castlevania hack-and-slash are all but done away with.  I personally felt that the pacing was off...the opening level was pretty good, but the first 3 chapters of the game are an utter slog...I almost couldn't get through it I was so bored.  That has a lot to do with the game's overall pacing and the relatively mundane encounters during these levels, but moreso with the actual combat.Combat is...well, mediocre at best.  Each and every enemy in the game has a very specific pattern that you must learn to defeat them.  This includes the most basic of enemies all the way up to large monsters and bosses.  Your whip attacks are pathetically weak, barely chipping away at bosses an large monsters while you spend the majority of the fight rolling and dodging out of the way.  A reactive deflect allows players an opportunity to take advantage of a stunned opponent and unleash a quick combo for a very slightly increased damage output, but otherwise combat consists primarily of stick-and-move while dodging, blocking and deflecting.  This makes for LONG battles against basic enemies that get old quickly.As is typical with Castlevania games, players have access to side weapons that are ideal in certain situations, and should be used whenever possible.  However, it is not until very late in the game that they become more useful, as the best of the abilities are not granted to players until the final stages of the game.  If you are up for backtracking, you can replay previous level to get whatever items you may have missed.  By the time you get to the final 2 chapters you should have enough skills to go back and get all of the weapon upgrades (simply increased carrying capacities), if you feel like playing through them again.  I say that with reservation because...Difficulty:This is easily the most difficult, frustrating and unforgiving Castlevania game ever.  I've been playing games for just about 25 years now, and I can say with confidence that Castlevania: Lord of Shadow ranks up there with my top 5 hardest games of all time.  Basic enemies shrug off all attacks from your pathetic whip, never getting stunned or caught in combos.  This makes purchasing whip combos utterly useless, as they are situational and very rarely does a situation where they may be useful ever pop up.  To be perfectly honest, I felt the major boss encounters were extremely easy compared to the game's basic foes.  Again, combat was an utter chore, as every enemy had a specific pattern.  Only certain attacks are effective, and even then those attacks rarely cause any beneficial trait such as knockback or stunning.  It is not until you completely power up all abilities at the very end of the game that you can start pulling off more effective whip attacks.  I found myself avoiding combat whenever possible.Control:Not bad, but this game suffers from the same affliction that has hit many other games as of late: Too Many Functions on One Button.  This often results in you trying to draw in magic orbs instead of dodging, double jumping when trying to transition to a ledge, and so on.  This cost me countless deaths as I played.  Otherwise, combos are relatively easy to do and movement is solid.  The wonky camera usually causes bizarre directional controls.Overall:This is an odd game.  I love Castelvania, but I had a very distinctive love/HATE relationship with this entry.  I didn't feel like it was a God of War rip off, as so many have said, simply because in God of War, the mindless button-mashing combat is the most fun aspect of the game.  Here, combat was a boring chore that made me groan every time I was forced into it.  Because of the story and characters I felt compelled to beat the game.  I felt like I was torturing myself but in the end it paid off...the game has a great ending and the surprising extended ending after the credits will have all long-time Castlevania fans do a complete jaw-drop.  Achievement are relatively easy to get, and there are \"Trial\" challenges associated with each level after beating it.  I recommend coming back after you complete the game and are fully upgraded before attempting the trials.  Many of them are ridiculously easy, while others are brutally hard.Having completed the game on all difficulties, and despite being an achievement junkie, I don't anticipate ever coming back to this game.  While it was a good story experience, the gameplay was a turn off.  I don't know, maybe I'm getting old and my skill aren't what they used to be, but this game almost felt like a chore to get through rather than a fun video game.Pros:Excellent story-telling through beautifully rendered cut-scenesSuperb voice-acting featuring Patrick StewartAmazing character designGorgeous levelsInteresting Puzzle-solving elements break-up monotonous combatCons:Incredibly difficult - NOT for casual or weekend gamersMonotonous, boring combatUnbalanced difficulty - basic enemies are hard while some (most) bosses are surprisingly easyHorribly spasmatic camera can result in needless, frustrating deathsBad pacingFinal verdict:This is a game for hardcore gamers looking for a brutal time.  It's an overall very good game with great storytelling aspects, superb voice acting and a memorable ending.  However, being a long0time castlevania fan that felt like I was putting myself through torture while playing the game, I recommend this only to hardcore castelvania fans, and even then those fans may be disappointed that the gameplay is so very different than typical castelvania.  Change can be good folks.  But again, casual gamers stay away...this isn't quite your thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

Adding this to a wide range of commands available and the ability to affect the beginning of the battle based on how you approach the enemy (there are no random battles - you can pick and choose your fights) lend to an amazing battle experience.Sadly, the rest of the game is woefully lacking. Characters and plot are predictable, side quests, short of looking around for extra items, are nonexistent, there are way too many places to heal (taking away much of the challenge), moves tend to fall into either \"totally ineffectual\" or \"totally awesome!\" categories, and, worst of all, the final boss fight is 80% fighting the previous bosses of the game followed by a laughably easy final battle, especially considering the difficulty of some of the previous fights.The game is definitely worth a play-through, especially for those who have never tried the Grandia battle system, but as an entire game Grandia II could have been much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2009"}

Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"A great game that lives up to the Castlevania name","reviewText":"Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow is a side-scrolling adventure game with a strong RPG element that greatly adds to the gameplay, making it a lot of fun even though most side-scrollers went out of style years ago.  As a fan of the early Castlevania games I found myself skeptical of a game starring a non-Belmont hero (who doesn't start with a whip!), but I was pleasantly surprised.Audience: Dawn of Sorrow is an old school side scroller, but that does not make it dull by today's standards.  On the contrary it's quite a lot of fun, and the RPG element of the game not only makes the game appealing for those people who like to work on and improve a character throughout the game but also adds quite a bit of replay value.Graphics and Sound:  Graphics are so-so.  They're adequate but not overwhelming.  The soundtrack, however, is incredible--very well done.  I don't play many games with the sound up high, but I did this one.Gameplay:  Pretty simple.  You play as Soma, the reincarnated Dracula (there's a previous game where all this comes to light) who's trying to fight his evil urges and overcome a dark cult.  You fight with an array of weapons and can collect many types of armor and other accessories--pretty standard for a game like this.  As Dracula incarnate, however, Soma has the ability to harvest the souls of his fallen enemies, giving him some aspect of their power.This is where the game really shines and what gives it so much replay value.  There are tons of souls, some common, some very rare.  Some souls enhance Soma's attributes, some allow you to throw stuff, and some can be summoned as familiars who fight for you.  In addition most of these souls can be upgraded by harvesting more of the same type, and several of them can become quite powerful.  Some of these souls are pretty lame but many are very powerful, and you'll find yourself using different souls in different situations.  There's also a merchant and an ally who can improve your gear using the souls you've collected.  The storyline is pretty good, with some friends, some enemies, and a sort of wild card--Julius Belmont, a bounty hunter who is Soma's friend but who will not hesitate to destroy him if he cannot control his dark side.Control: Control is pretty good, and once you get the hang of switching souls around it's pretty straightforward.  It doesn't take much time to get used to the controls.Challenge: There are several ways to \"beat\" this game.  The most basic involves just plowing through the game killing stuff and defeating the bosses.  That, however, will not give you the best of the 3 possible endings, and so there is replay value in trying for the best ending.  You can also unlock the ability to play as Julius (and eventually fight Soma).  The Soul Harvesting aspect also provides a great challenge since some of these are tough to come by and anyone wanting to collect all or even most of the souls will find themselves investing quite a bit of time.Dawn of Sorrow is a great game, good enough not only to own but probably good enough to get you hooked on the rest of the series as well (I know I'll be checking into the other games).  In fact I'd say this game has as much replay value as any I've yet played on the DS, and that's saying something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0000D12XI","description":"In 2001,Max Paynearrived to set the benchmark for action gaming, earning countless awards and revolutionizing the genre with cinematic combat sequences fuelled by the groundbreaking use of slow motion and compulsive narrative-driven gameplay. Now, working together with Rockstar Games' New York-based production team, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneis set to raise the bar for action games all over again when it's released fall 2003.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Worth playing for one reason: bullet time","reviewText":"Here's a review, without any BS.  Max Payne 2 is a mediocre shooter, plus one absolutely fantastic gimmick: \"Bullet time\".  That's it, plain and simple.  Bullet time and slow-motion cinematics are what make this game good.  Without them, this game would be a 2-star bargain bin game.  Case closedThis is because as far as shooters go, there is very little else good about this game.  AI is abysmal - enemies constantly blow themselves up with grenades and don't know how to use cover or flank you.  Level design is repetitive and totally unimaginative (with the exception of the weird \"Funhouse\" level).  Most of the game you are going through repetitive brown and gray environments, walking along wooden planks and scaffolding.  Over and over again.  Unreal 2 was panned by everyone for its level design, but Max Payne 2 is worse.Worst of all is the laughable \"Film Noir\" story and the intrusive cut scenes and dialog.  This game has cutscene after cutscene after cutscene, at least for the first half of the game.  You shoot five bad guys and then sit through a cut scene.  Then you shoot four more bad guys and sit through a cut scene.  This might be nice for a 60-hour RPG, but it's inexcusable for a game that only takes you an afternoon to finish anyways.  On the bright side, it does pick up a lot about halfway through the game.The story for the game is convoluted, it makes no sense, and it resolves next to nothing at the end.  I don't mind a mindless action game if it has a simplistic and unobtrusive story.  Red Faction 2 is a perfect example of this kind of game.  Max Payne 2, however, has a psychedelic weirdo Clockwork Orange-style instead of the simple and straightforward one in the first game.And then there's the horrible dialog, which is more full of Film-Noir parody than the first game.  The dialog is so intrusive that it spoils any chance that you have of developing genuine feelings for Max and Mona.  This is a shame, because the love story could have been a great part of the game.  As it is, the romance between them is too unbelievable.  Remedy spent too much time writing demented metaphors, and not enough time just coming up with a story that makes sense.But to overcome all that, there's \"bullet time\", which is so great that it overrides any faults that the game has and makes it worth playing, albeit at reduced price.  \"Bullet time\" is simply the coolest feature ever added to an action game, and you can play it for hours and hours without getting sick of it.  One nice change to \"Bullet time\" for this game is that your supply regenerates between battles, so you can gun down six guys in a room, all in slow motion, and not worry about not having any left for the next battle.  Bullet time combined with rag doll physics makes for endlessly exciting gun battles.  Gunfights in Max Payne 2 are pure shooting goodness.  Blowing away a guy in slow motion with a shotgun and watching him crash backwards through a glass window is a sight to see.The other thing that I love about this game are the TV shows that you get to watch and the conversations that you get to listen to.  There are a lot of funny things happening around you, especially the TV shows like \"Lords and Ladies\" and \"Dick Justice\".  I would guess that there is at least 35 minutes worth of TV shows that you can watch in the game.  Overall, the environment feels very alive and realistic.  More so than most other games.Max Payne 2 is so absurdly short that you will be done with it in a day, even if you play it casually.  Given how much filler and extra material is in this game, I would say that it only provides about 3 or 4 good hours of action.  It is fun to replay, but it is still a poor value at full price.  I definitely recommend getting this game to experience bullet time, but don't pay top dollar for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2003"}

That pretty much sums it up.The games are kinda short and have little less contents than their 3 bigger brothers, but not by much, so I don't count this as a con. You could finish both games, on Normal difficulty setting, within 10-12 hours. Not too short, in my opinion.Cons:- The puzzles can be unclear and get you stuck at times, so are the things you need to do in some boss fights.- The worst enemy is the camera. It's not so bad on Normal, but it will get you killed a lot on God Mode, and also be a part that makes you stuck on puzzles.- Chains of Olympus look just passable. They didn't redo any models or textures. It looks like a Playstation 1.8 game with a better rendering and anti-alias. The shadow casting doesn't look right in places.Ghost of Sparta, on the other hand, looks quite a lot better.In conclusion:If you have never played these 2 games before, go for it. These are bite-sized God of War, but it's definitely a mouthful bite.If you have never played any God of War before, then what have you been waiting for?NOTES:*** This doesn't affect the score ***God Mode in Ghost of Sparta would probably make you want to stab your finger through your ear, and gouge your brain out, Kratos style.I got stuck in one fight for 4 and a half hours, and I haven't been able to get pass it. Playing God Mode and Challenge Mode in both games could extend the play time up to 20 hours or more. Ghost's God Mode is harder than Normal Mode in Ninja Gaiden Sigma. Chains' God Mode is hard, but not as much.Anyway, that's up to your skills. So if you're a casual gamer, like me, be warned. The frustration could easily turn a normal guy into The Hulk.So, if you love to unlock everything, you'll get your money's worth.

Overall, I found the premise interesting (sort of like the Matrix) the immersion in history was fun, and the open world aspect of the series was engaging.  The series boasts that the new features in this edition of the franchise are the hookblade, which is used for fast travel and combat, and some first person level hopping sections unlocked by finding \"data fragments.\"  There is also a mini-game section (which I didn't really care for) where you direct assassins from the roof, while Templars invade. Since I am a new player for the series, ALL of it was new to me, but those are the features the box and directions highlight as new. They seemed to fit with the game well enough for me, and certainly didn't detract from it.The game is supposed to be playable in 3D on the 3 major platforms (XBOX, Playstation, and PC), but I didn't try that feature (I wear glasses, and 3D modes in general give me headaches).The game features multiplayer modes, but, as well all of the other single-player franchises out there that are shoehorning multi-player into their games (looking at you, Mass Effect), I had no desire to try it. I played through the single player game, only.Overall, the graphics look very nice, the combat was satisfying, and the story is pretty darn interesting (I am a sucker for \"alternate history\").  I rate the game 4 stars.  It isn't perfect (some of the platforming sections were frustrating, and the combat can get confused and \"sticky\" when there are too many enemies to battle) but it is a very good game.4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

Brawl was not as high as many Nintendo fans, but I still wanted the game. It's likely that if you are reading this review and you haven't already purchased the game, then you're the same type of gamer as me. Occasional Wii player who enjoys a good game. First thing I'll tell you is that if you consider yourself a \"casual gamer,\" this game probably won't be your favorite, but you might still be able to get some enjoyment out of it. It doesn't use any of the friendly Wii controls that you are accustomed to having, and you won't stand much of a chance in the online modes without some serious practicing. Also, there is no tutorial to tell you how to play (although the instruction booklet does a good job of this). This review is written for the \"casual gamer,\" since I assume most hardcore Nintendo fans have already purchased, and are enjoying the game. Finally, before I get into the review I'll give a quick description of the game for those that are new to the series... basically it's a \"side-scrolling\" fighting game, where you play as various Nintendo characters from both yesteryear and the present. Each character has his or her own set of special moves that can be used against the other players with a few button pushes. There are lots of modes, but in general the person that does the most killing and the least dying wins.Now onto the review... I've broken the review down into separate sections to make it more easy for you to follow, or to just get information about a particular topic.Graphics: 6/10Well, if you mention graphics, the first thing hardcore Nintendo fan will tell you is \"GRAPHICS DON'T MATTER.\" My opinion of this is slightly different, while graphics don't make a game, they sure can help improve the experience. Now onto the graphics in this game.... most game companies have realized this by now, but apparently Nintendo didn't get the memo: cutscenes are better if they have similar graphical style to the game.In Super Smash Bros. the majority of the game looks exactly the same as its predecessor Super Smash Bros. Mele. Some will tell you this is fine, but I just don't understand how 7 years later they best they can pull off is \"slightly better\" than the previous game, even if the Wii isn't much more powerful. My second complaint here is the cutscene thing. Cutscenes were all pre-rendered and stored as movies. Sure they look amazing, but it sure takes away from the experience when you are playing a crappy game, you go through a door, wait for a load, watch a movie that looks nothing like what you can play, sit through another load, and then continue playing. It took me about 4 hours of play to realize that what was happening in the game was actually a continuation of what's showed in the cutscenes, that's how different things look between the two. Now for a casual gamer these details probably won't matter because you just want to play. And if you are the casual gamer, you will probably enjoy the graphics and cutscenes. But for me, and most people who are used to an immersive experience in the game, the graphics here just don't cut it.Sound: 10/10Chances are that everybody has played a previous Nintendo game. And chances are that the music from that game will have worked its way into this game somehow. The sound in this game is really amazing. There are hundreds of tracks from which to choose, and you can customize which tracks are played on which stages at which ratios. Also, there are many new recorded sounds for each character, and the new music that was made for the game is also amazing. All in all, the sound in the game won't disappoint anybody, casual or hardcore you will want to play this game on the loudest volume setting you can.Gameplay/Controls: 9/10If you've played a Smash Bros. game before, you probably don't need to read this section because nothing has changed too much gameplay-wise. It's the same \"button-smashing\" (or not button smashing if you know what you are doing) play as before, but everything is more balanced, and each character, despite their strengths or weaknesses has a fairly equal chance of winning. With 35 characters, I really gotta praise Nintendo for getting this balanced so fairly (although you will learn that there are still a few characters that realllly suck!!). They've also added more items (which you can pick up to add a crazy effect to the game, such as throwing a Pokeball at an enemy, and having it attack them). The gameplay is fair enough that a person who has never played before stands a fairly equal chance of winning a match as those who've played hundreds of games. Another amazing thing Nintendo did was giving you 4 ways to play. You can play with the Wii Remote turned sideways, with the Wii Remote \"right side up\" and the nunchuck, with the Wii Classic Controller, and with the Nintendo Gamecube controller. The system is brilliant, and allows you to change what every single button does for your particular setup. My only complaint in this section is that there are no motion controls whatsoever through the entire game, and it makes navigating menu's more of a pain than what you are used to on your Wii.Multiplayer: 5/10Offline: 5/5I'll start with the positive here. Offline multiplayer is amazing. They've got \"tournament\" support for up to 32 players, with each player being able to VERY easily pick which controller they use, and play against a randomly selected group of people from the tournament, moving up the bracket to the championship. They've also got a simple rotation mode where up to 32 people rotate through playing random maps where the loser(s) or winner(s) swap out with people who are waiting (Don't worry, if you've only got 30 friends you can have 2 AI players fill the extra spots for you). It eliminates the \"hey it's my turn you have played more\" aspect of your party because it keeps track of everybody's playing time and keeps things fair. Of course you can play just yourself against computer players, with varying level of skill. Once again, the players have excellent AI, and they \"know\" how to play to the strengths of their character without ever feeling unfair. All in all, this is by far the most solid Smash Bros. yet in terms of offline multiplayer.Online Multiplayer: 0/5Now it's time to talk about the Nintendo WiFi connection. To put it simply, it's just a mess. Either Nintendo hasn't played online on the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3, or they simply don't care. There is still no universal friends list, voice chat, text chat, or any online features you are accustomed to from your other consoles. Whats even worse is Nintendo's excuse... they claim people don't want these features, and that they aren't safe. The other two consoles have made it pretty obvious that people DO want these features, and they've also added parental controls to make it completely customizable to parents that their children can and can't do. To me, Nintendo doesn't add these things out of sheer laziness. But let's talk about what is in the game. First of all, there's the \"play with anybody option.\" If you choose this, you should (although many gamers have yet to get this feature to work) get matched with 3 other people (whose names you can't see), and play brawl with them until everybody quits. The other option is \"with friends.\" With this feature, you can call friends, ask for their 12 digit friend code, enter it, have them to the same, and then play with them.Additionally, you are more limited with modes and maps than with single player, and the netcode (the portion of the game code that connects you to the internet and other players) is so poorly written that Nintendo had to put this right in the instruction booklet: \"It is normal for the game to periodically freeze while playing online.\" Brawl is a more basic game than, say, Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4, both of which are consistently lag free, but Brawl is just plagued with lag. So much so that with most of your friends the game will be unplayable online. I wasn't expecting much from this game online, but it delivered even less than I expected. It's probably the worst Nintendo WiFi connection enabled game to date. Also missing is any sort of leaderboard feature, or a way to compare your scores to other gamers across the world (A feature which Microsoft and Sony REQUIRE every game to have on their systems). Now I know many Nintendo fans don't care about online, which is why I broke this section into two subsections, but for me this is really a huge turn off because I had planned to get a decent amount of play-time out of the online play.Single Player/Campaign: 7/10In addition to the wealth of multiplayer content we've talked about, the game also has a decent chunk of single player content. My favorite part is the \"event matches,\" where you try to do other things such as race through a level or break all the pieces of a level in the fastest time possible. This really gives a nice break from the standard fighting component of the game. Also, there's an Adventure mode that takes about 8-10 hours to complete. As discussed in the graphics section, I wasn't a huge fan of the adventure mode just because the graphics are so much different between the cinematics and game. That being said, the actually playing of the single player is fairly fun, albeit VERY repetitive. Additionally, the boss battle at the end isn't even fun because the character is overpowered, cheap, and can just teleport away whenever you start hitting him. This doesn't detract from the game in any way, but it sure does make for an annoying way to end an otherwise fun adventure mode.  Nintendo does give plenty of reason to play though, as you will unlock lots of characters and stages to play on the more you play single player modes. Also added to the game was an \"achievement\" system, which allows you to look at things of importance you've done, and more things you need to do to unlock stuff. This is a very cool feature, but would have been cooler with an online component such as is done on Xbox Live, and what is soon to be done with Home on Playstation Network, so that friends can see what you've done and compare it to what they've done, which would have added HUGE amounts of replayability for Nintendo fans as they work their hardest to break those records.Overall: 3/5 Stars (An average of the above scores)Note that if you average all the above scores it would convert to 7.4/10.  Amazon doesn't allow parts of a star, and I didn't think the game deserved 4 stars so I rounded the 7.4 down to 3/5.  I'll leave you with a quick summary of the pro's and con's of the game:Pros:- Amazing offline multiplayer- Best Smash Bros. game yet in terms of gameplay- Great new items and characters- Single player will take some time to beat and is fun for the most partCons:- Possibly the most shallow and buggy online game ever (on ANY system)- The graphics in single player actually take away the cool experience of the game- Unfair boss battle at the end (It's NOT just hard- its unfair)?'s:- Why can Nintendo still not figure out online play?- Nintendo did an excellent job balancing characters, but why still leave a few that are extremely overpowered?- Why did Nintendo think it would be cool to put the best possible cinematics in the game, when games like Halo 3 (360), and Metal Gear Solid (PS3) have been getting massive praise for doing just the opposite?If you've played Smash Bros. games before and liked them, I recommend a purchase of this game. If you're more of a casual gamer, and enjoy some of the more basic games the Wii offers, you might want to do a little more research or consider a rent before you throw down $50 on this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2008"}

Nintendo has done a pretty good job in making this game what it was expected to be; a \"smashing\" sequel to the \"super\" Super Smash Brothers Melee.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (one being the lowest and ten being the highest) I will rate this game's features as well as compare it to SSBM (another fun Nintendo hit you should check out).Controls, 8: This game is versatile with what you can control the characters with.  You don't have to use the wii remote and nunchuck as you can also use the wii remote alone (tilted sideways) and I think you can also use traditional controllers (gamecube, etc.).  If you don't read the instruction booklet before you play the game (like I often don't) it's easy to overlook how many ways you can control the characters.  A valid point made by many is that the controls are mostly traditional.  There is very little usage of the wii pointer (you use it mainly for character select) and no shaking, waving, or any of that jazz.  You just push buttons.  The speaker on the wii remote is used very little, but for what it's worth, I think the usage of it was creative (it's used for characters to make a signature noise when you select them).  Plus, I don't think I recall any other games that even bothered to use that feature.  One more thing, you do need a traditional controller of some sort to access all of the trial games (like an F-Zero racing game that's unlockable); which is one part I dislike.Adventure mode storyline, 9: Now this was something I wasn't expecting.  A storyline with an actual plot; not just a character randomly running through everyone else's worlds.  Unlike SSBM, you don't just simply pick a character and go through the same trials over and over again.  This time, all of the characters get involved; and you'll have to control different characters at different parts of the storyline.  The plot is interesting, but confusing.  Half of the time, I wasn't really quite sure what was going on, or why someone chose to oppose someone else.  This confusion, however, oddly adds to the desire to progress in the story, and get your bearings on what is going on.  \"What is the plot?\" I hear a few of you ask.  Well, I think it's slightly open to interpretation, but here's what I think: Kirby and Mario are having a practice match to decide who's the strongest or whatever.  After their battle, one of them gets turned into what looks like a trophy (to signal he's been beaten.  This is a common theme of the plot), and the winner touches him to bring him back to life.  Then they get attacked by what appears to be creatures kind of like heartless (you know, from the Kingdom Hearts series?  If you don't, they are like evil creatures who spawn from dark puddles and have simplistic, but creepy faces).  During the course of the match one of them gets blown away (for me, it was Mario; but you choose who to fight as in any situation that calls for fighting.  That may affect the outcome as I chose Kirby.) and Peach and Zelda get kidnapped by one of those oversized piranha plant kids (think Super Mario Galaxy).  You can only rescue one (I was aiming for Zelda, but I accidentally rescued Peach) before you cream the oversized weed.  The remaining one then gets shot by a strange weapon that also turns fighters into trophies.  The shooter of the weapon is the hideous Wario on his specially built bike.  Why did he do it?  I finished the story and even I don't know.  What I do know is he won't be the only villain involved.  Either way, Wario kidnaps the trophesized princess and takes off.  The stadium begins to fall apart, and the remaining hero takes the remaining princess and escapes.  Meanwhile, Pit (from Kid Icarius) witnesses the whole thing.  His goddess (I have forgotten her name) gives him a bow and arrow which doubles as a dual blade weapon.  Then, Pit flies off.  Who will Pit aid?  Will the hero who got blasted survive?  What will become of the trophesized princess, as well as the remaining princess and the remaining hero?  What is the real evil plot behind Wario's actions?  Who else is and will be involved?  You'll have to play the game and decipher for yourself.  But rest assured, all characters (except one that I know about) will play a role in this epic adventure.  The reason it's I rated the storyline a 9 is because some characters play a bigger part than others (I'm referring to the fact that Sonic the Hedgehog didn't get a very big part, and Snake did...  While I don't have a problem with Snake, the Sega mascot should have had a much bigger role).  Also, there was no dialogue (what, they can't speak each other's languages?)Characters, 8:  This stands for a large number of things.  Personality, variety, role in adventure mode, the likableness of the characters themselves and even availability.  I won't grade on accuracy to previous games because there are some characters I haven't even known before now.  Firstly, the characters that I'm absolutely positive you can play out of the box are: Mario, Peach, Bowser, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Pit, Link, Zelda/Sheik, Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Samus/Zero Suit Samus, Fox, Ike, Lucas, Ice Climbers, Olimar w/ Pikmin, Pikachu, and Pokemon Trainer/Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard.  Also, these characters come with a new, more realistic look.  You can see every stitch on Mario's overalls; and they look like real overalls!  While there are many characters you can play right out of the box, fans of Sega are probably asking, \"Where are Sonic and Snake?\"  The sad truth of it is that they are unlockable characters.  I was disappointed because it was like a cruel joke; I waited so long to play Sonic the Hedgehog in SSBB, only to find out I had to go through the trouble of unlocking him first (and he wasn't easy to unlock either).  It wasn't like he was even kept secret within the game itself as they had teaser trailers of both Sonic and Snake within the games movies.  Sticking to Sonic for a while, the main reason I was so inspired to buy this game was the knowledge that he was in it.  In adventure mode, however, he didn't get the respect he deserved.  He only barely showed up at the last minute before the final boss; and while he made a cool entrance, it was almost like he had nothing to do with the story at all.  In fact, it almost seemed like he was completely separate from the other characters.  I have my suspicions and theories; I'm not sure Nintendo intended on having him in this game at all.  That's not to say they favored their own characters; Snake got a very good part in the plot, and if I didn't know any better I would have almost guessed he was a Nintendo character.  It's almost screaming to me, however, that they planned the story around the other characters; maybe Yuji Naka balked about letting Nintendo have him at first, or maybe the Nintendo company were late in figuring out what the public wanted, but I'm unable to verify whether or not these claims could be true.  Still, did anyone else notice that SSBB came out a little later than it was supposed to?  It makes me wonder if that extra time was used to include a character that wasn't originally planned to be in there.  Either way, Sonic didn't get a big role in the storyline, but maybe big Sonic fans can find solace in some of the other features pertaining to him.  For example, Sonic's design is very good.  He looks great, his taunts pertain to his voice and personality, and his moves and final smash are really cool.  The only awkward things about his design is he never smiles except when he's taunting (which isn't really like him) and his attacks are kind of hard to use.  I can almost guarantee he is the fastest character, though (faster than even Pikachu!), and he even has a trophy and music section to himself.  Shadow shows up as an assistant character, using chaos control to slow the enemies down.  In the Green Hill battle field,  look in the background at the loop; you'll sometimes see Tails and Knuckles running (you'll only see their backs) that loop.  Now, I don't know how many are acquainted with Snake (I certainly wasn't) but he's a funny character.  He thinks that when he's under his cardboard box he's invisible.  Some characters are endearing, and others I could live without (I'm thinking I don't like Wario).  The characters are indeed various, even more so than last time.  The personalities are great and apparent with each character.  As well as the many characters available from the start, most unlockable characters are actually somewhat simple to unlock in adventure mode, and I think you could also unlock some of them in Classic mode.  Unlocking Toon Link probably gave me the most trouble.  What impressed me the most was how many old characters made it back.  I wasn't expecting the likes of Mr. Game and Watch, Marth, and Falco again.  In fact, the only characters who didn't make it back (so far) are Roy, Pichu, and Mewtwo; everyone else seems to be accounted for.  Except, I don't know about Young Link (is Young Link and Toon Link the same thing?).  If Toon Link is considered Young Link these days, then he's back; but with a completely new look.  Think of the Link from Windwaker or Phantom Hourglass.  The addition of new characters such as Meta Knight and Lucario, are awesome and well deserved.  Overall, probably the best thing about this game is it's variety in characters; but before I close this section, does anyone else think Pit looks like Sora with angel wings and a laurel crown?Graphics, 9: Okay, I'll try to cover the next sections quickly; I've already rambled for too long.  The graphics are just as good as SSBM, but while some things are completely different, others seem to have stayed the same.  Characters like Mario and Link, as stated before, are more realistic in a seeming attempt to escape the cartoonish look.  Kirby, on the other hand, looks practically the same; and Pikachu has only gone through tiny changes.  Some backgrounds have the air of a 3D role playing game; others look like they could fit right in with the old SSBM.  Either way, the graphics are just as good as the precessor; they're just changed for the most part.Features, 10: It's not all about fighting anymore!  Take pictures of the action using less memory, watch teaser trailers and other movies you've unlocked, listen to music from all of the characters, arrange trophies and stickers and take pictures of them, etcetera!  There is a lot you can do.  The trophy lotery has become a fun and interactive shooting game, where you can shoot trophies with coins to nab them.  The Home Run contest is back, along with all the melee works (cruel melee for example), and Break the Targets (the target fields are not specialized by character this time, however).  Do the events, and even select your difficulty for them!  Either way, if you get sick of Classic mode, it's easy to escape the repetition.Overall, 9: So there you have it.  This game isn't perfect, but I say the hype it received isn't a joke.  Before I close, I offer you a tip that actually relates to my title: if you are having trouble defeating your enemies with your own character's moves, find something, anything at all, and throw it at that character to watch him get boo boos and fly off the field *laughs evilly* bear in mind, however, that he should be at least slightly weakened first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2008"}

Im been loyal even through the mediocre years. I say new generation Because it introduces new players of the series to how the game was back in its glory days of the playstation 1. Ive loved all the games but the first installments I thought were the best. However Players will unfortunately be able to only play as Sweet Tooth, Doll Face and Mr. Grimm. This may be a complete let down to some of the older fans but new fans probably will not mind as much. These are the only players that I could choose, maybe you can unlock more im not sure? With that being said I think there is around 15 or 16 vehicles you can ride around in so thats a huge plus. You still have the great multiplayer which makes the game in my opinion.

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"Halo: Then and Now","reviewText":"Halo: Combat Evolved changed what it meant to have multiplayer, so the Anniversary edition was quite a nice surprise. If you are a buff of Halo, then pay attention to the new stuff a little later. If you are a person thinking about getting into Halo, then this is the best start (unless you want to go in terms of story, which makes Halo: Reach a better start but I digress...) Halo: Combat Evolved is about a super soldier aka a spartan with the designation of 117 known as the Master Chief fighting a conglomerate of alien races known as the Covenant on a ring in outer space (thus the title Halo) where you come in contact with a very horrifying surprise. This edition of the classic XBOX game has the unique ability of supporting both the updated graphics, and the original graphics. Just press the back button on your controller to switch between engines to see how far visuals have come. (Just be sure there is not any enemies around!). With that being said, gameplay and story were not touched at all. If you play Reach for example, then immediately jump into Halo: CEA, then you'll notice weapon movement and Warthog driving were not improved in the slightest. You can clearly tell you have to be a little bit more finesse with your controller where movement is concerned. Also, starting with Halo 2, there are skulls and terminals hidden in the game, however, you can only find them with the new graphics running (:-P). Even though the differences can still be seen, this is a must have for anyone who calls themselves a Halo fan, or gamer in general. 9/10 personally because of the surprise (You Halo junkies know...)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"J. Jeffers","summary":"Must-Have for any Zelda Fan","reviewText":"This is an outstanding Zelda game.  It has all the hallmarks of a Zelda game, so if you had issues with any of the prior games then you probably won't like this one.  But if you liked the other Zelda games (especially A Link to the Past and WindWalker) you'll probably love this.People are complaining about graphics, but the Wii is not a 360.  It's essentially a Gamecube with a neat interface.  The graphics, for the console, are great.  Further, the gameplay is outstanding.  The use of the unique wii control system is intuitive and fun to use.Overall, this game is outstanding and should be on everyone's wish list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"Me","summary":"It's an RPG, BUT......","reviewText":"It's somehow REALLY fun!!!! I usually HATE THE **** OUT OF RPG'S, like LOTR third age (which was an unbelievable let-down, since I thought it was like the amazing return of the king). Every time I play it, I look forward to the new varieties of companions that join you later. I will admit that, at first, I was sad about the battle system, but soon I got the hang of it ad it became really fun. It's ironic how games like this make systems as early as 1st or 2nd gen systems better than 7th gen. And to the 7th gen(wii 360 ps3) executives, GET RID OF THE ******* ANIME RPGS!! THEY ARE REALLY STUPID!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2007"}

I mean, wasn't the Game boy Advance SP small enough as it is???It doesnt make any sence, why would someone willingly pay more for something that's not as good?The GBA SP has a larger and brighter screen, it's alot cooler looking than the Game boy micro, and c'mon people... The SP was already portable enough! I mean, how small do you need it to be?!If you want to waste your money then be my guest, but I just thought that I should warn you that basically what you're doing is looking to buy something that's way too small to fit comfortably in the hands of an adult, probably very fragile, and more expensive than a the already efficient Game boy Advance SP.If you disagree with me then just look at the facts, the GBA SP is small, (but not too small for adult hands) it has a much larger and brighter screen, and because of the SP's folding design, the screen is protected from getting scratched.Oh, and did I forget to mention that the Game boy micro can't play any of the older Game boy games?So you see, if you were thinking about purchasing the Game boy micro then you might want to take a look at the Game boy Advance SP first, and then figure out which of the two fits you best.Note: Only the Graphite and Pearl blue GBA SP's have a brighter screen, all other models aren't as brightly lit!Written by:Shadow Mage (the game maniac)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2005"}
