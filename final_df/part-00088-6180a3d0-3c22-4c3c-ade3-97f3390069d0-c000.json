{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Ehhh - tough one...","reviewText":"Now from the outset I want to say I'm just not a fan of this game. If you are a fan, then you've already played it extensively and therefore I must question why you're bothering to read a three star review about a game you already own (just a snide for the inevitable automatic down-voters).In all seriousness, if after reading my review, you feel that I'm missing something vital which has spoiled and skewed my thoughts about this game please feel free to comment and offer any insight into anything I may have missed.Firstly if you're looking for a GTA set in the 40s then as I'm sure you've read this isn't it and I wasn't expecting it to be. But to my surprise it *almost* is, which makes me sadder about the game in a way. I'll explain; you can actually free roam the streets of 40s LA, hijack cars, crash them, race around and even pick up some side missions at the same time. There's even a kind of collect cars element and indeed you can see points of interest (there are postcard landmarks to find). So that part feels quite familiar. Unfortunately you cannot do pretty much anything else though. Remember how cut down and restrictive GTA4 felt after you realised that R* had removed all of the fun stuff? Well it's worse in L.A. Noire. There's just nothing to do in this crazy-detailed expansive city... which is a crying shame. The major plus of Rockstar's GTA (pre GTA4) incarnations were the distractions; if you were bored with the storyline and just felt like a change you could jump into a taxi and drive around servicing the city. Or you could go hunting for cars, or race a few RC vehicles around the place etc. You could just goof off pretty much whenever you wanted to and that, to me at least, relieved some of the tediousness of the storyline.But here the location is nothing more than another set piece designed to help visualize the story. Many of the 'exciting' chases whether on foot or in a vehicle are clearly massively contrived and often there's no way to catch up to a fleeing suspect until the game makers dictate that you can. This was especially demonstrated when one perp in a car that I was chasing got caught up on some architecture that he obviously shouldn't have. I was now parked in front of him but couldn't get out of my car to arrest him nor would the game jump to a cut scene. Instead the car just revved and jerked about until it broke free from whatever glitch it was caught on. At that point it jumped back onto its predetermined rails and sped off - even though I was in front of it! Eventually we both arrived at the designated trigger point and the cut scene kicked in. So I ask you - did you like those invincible enemies and indestructible vehicles in GTA4 that were put there solely so you can see the logs rolling off the flatbed? No? Well then you'll feel the same way here. And mere traveling from one location to the next became so dull that I used the option of letting my partner drive almost 100% of the time which thankfully instantly transports you to your destination. Given that the beam-me-up option is there and taking into account the aforementioned lack of real ability to catch suspects whenever you want I do question why the driving element and even the city was even necessary - an utter waste really and a vast shame.But LAN isn't about being part of the GTA family so really should it be compared to it? Well let's drop the comparison then and see what we have here. The basic mechanism of the game is as follows; you're presented with a short cut scene usually showing the final moments of a murder then you have to look around for clues and interrogate suspects. Clues are found by walking around the crime scene and waiting for your controller to vibrate. At that point you can pick up the item or look at the clue and if it's relevant it gets added to your police blotter. Later, when interrogating people you can refer to the clues as evidence and thus force more dialogue out of the criminals. The more clues you find the more helpful and verbose your interactions with suspects will be. Interrogations themselves consist of a preset question that you cannot control (you don't choose from a selection of questions or anything like that) and then you receive an answer from the person that you're interviewing. You then have three choices: he's telling the truth, you're doubtful of their story, or they're outright lying. Choose the latter and you have to specifically select a clue that proves your accusation. You must try to coax enough info to be able to move onto the next location or close the case. Ultimately you'll accuse someone or they'll try to run and thus indict themselves and you move onto the next murder.Part of the theory of the game is being able to intuitively know when someone is not telling the whole truth. Deceit is written over liars faces due to the use of the most advanced lip syncing ever used in a video game to date. The massive amounts of data this takes almost certainly contributed to the game spanning three discs on the 360 and the work put into it really shows. It's phenomenal... and a complete waste of time. Firstly, based on your total lack of control over the interrogation (you can't even move the camera except when you're looking over your notes) and the fact each question and reply is separated by camera cuts I see no reason why this part (a major part) of the game couldn't have been filmed for real. There's no benefit to using the amazing facial animation developed here and displaying it in real time. This part of the game could genuinely be sold on a DVD movie with your DVD remote used as a selection tool. An old cartoon arcade game called Dragon's Lair was released this way to some success. Yes the real-time lip syncing is amazing - but why is it there? You can't get up in the middle and slap the perp in the face. You can't randomly choose to throw something at them or actually do anything.I just don't see why this tech was used in this game over having it shot with the actors on a set. Perhaps the reality is that it would expose the game for what it is -  a series of premeditated videos the order of delivery of which is chosen by your single button press. It's less interactive than those choose your adventure books.And so that's the two parts to the game - the driving around with occasional limited shoot outs and the video clips of people protesting their innocence.The atmosphere is excellent, the graphics amazing and it just should draw you in and flip you back to the 40s and to some extent it does. It's just not a very fun or entertaining or, most importantly, interactive way of doing it. I know I'm missing something - I really want to like LA Noire and I don't think it's a terrible game...I'm just not a fan.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play.

It is left to you and a few isolated groups that try to restore some semblance of civilization.The Pros:1.) beautiful, smooth flowing graphics (played with 4 Gb RAM and Ge-force GTX 470 video card)2.) atmosphere for buildings, tunnels and sewers...spooky ambient lighting, shifting shadows, dripping water and goo, creaking pipes, the sound of scampering unseen feet. The opening quest in Subway Town will have the hair on your neck standing up.3.) a nice balance between FPS individual enemy fights and 3rd person vehicle battles.4.) a competitive racing game (within the game) that allows you to earn cash and credits to improve cars, weapons etc.5.) as well as the single player mode, there is co-op with friends and a random game for battle other player on-line with your cars.6.) enemies are quick and devious, often in packs...making them a challenge to take down.7.) a crafting scheme that allows you to make several important objects from scavenged items.8.) a quick access system (with the use of F1-F4) allowing you use items (weapons, bandages, grenades etc.) quickly in the heat and chaos of battles (both against personnel and vehicles)9.) game saves...anytime!  Best to save very often.The Cons:1.) the cost...$59.00. Pricey!2.) performance issues...I've been lucky to have a set-up that runs really well. After reading some  other reviews, I guess others are not so fortunate. Friends of mine with running issues; many have an ati card in their computer...something to consider before spending $59.00 on this game. Hopefully a patch will fix these problems...because, when running properly, this is a great game!3.) with the 'Steam' download...no instructions. Making the initial learning curve a little more complicated than it needed to be.4.) initial splash screens (thankfully very short) and most cut-scenes are not skippable.5.) although the driving world is very open, the quests through buildings etc, is very linear.6.) having played and finished the game, I would say it has little replay value. There would be nothing new to try except playing it on a more difficult level.Impressions:A game very reminiscent to 'Borderlands', but in my opinion, a better effort.The in-game Racing feature, open world driving that usually involves car battles and the quests for objects within building areas turned out to be a lot of fun. The game, once you get acquainted with the game play is a real adrenal rush.As mentioned above, there seemed to be that fine balance between driving and questing that fit together perfectly to provide an interesting and intriguing game.I realize some people are having performance issues, but to me, much better than I expected.  5 Stars.Ray Nicholson","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

I love Uncharted more than any other game series to date. So I have been eagerly awaiting this game. Basically the only complaint I have heard about this game is it's too short, at around only 12 hours of gameplay. People said the same thing about Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception. I thought it was the perfect length and made for easy replay since it doesn't drag on. If you are like me and have been anxiously awaiting this game, you have undoubtedly been watching gameplay footage for the last year and seen how the controls are fluid and smooth for this third person game just like uncharted. So far, there is the right amount of action, cut scenes, sneaking and exploring, granted I have not gotten very far. The detail, the lighting effects, the music by world famous composer Gustavo Santaolalla (The Motorcycle Diaries, Brokeback Mountain) hits hard and dramatic and is intense. This isn't a typical post-apocalyptic zombie game, this is a survival game (Think Manhunt meets Uncharted meets Resident Evil 4), with the best cinema scenes done in a game that don't take you out of it but drop you even deeper into the perfection that is The Last Of Us, sure to be the Game Of The Year. Most everyone is scoring this game high and saying it is a masterpiece. So far I would agree. The controls are very similar to Uncharted, not too sluggish and the platforming in smoother than Uncharted. There is a lot of profanity which may bother some, and a lot of gore as well. I will update as I get further along in the game. So far, no glitches or frame rate issues or anything to complain about.*UPDATE 6/16*I'm nearly 50% complete and don't want to put the controller down. This game is intense, the \"clickers\" scare the crap outta me. My girlfriend sat and watched me play for nearly 2 hours, she couldn't believe how real everything was. The physics in this game are great, when roaming a half collapsed, tilted building, things roll the direction the building is leaning. The flash light effects are great, the batteries get low and you have to shake the controller to get your flashlight to keep working. The sound design is amazing. So far my only complaint is cycling through weapons is a bit clunky, especially when you're fighting for your life. I've died maybe like 5 times. My girlfriend kept asking me how I knew where to go and what to do, and it's really all due to the amazing level design, everything is so intuitive. Also, there was an autosave glitch day one that Naughty Dog has already fixed with patch 1.01. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2013"}

The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever.  Does this do better then its prediseccor?...YES.  OH HELL YES.  The game is a solid good game.  The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story.  I won't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters(serpartly) in the game.  One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris(who was in RE1)and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..I really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic.  I loved the graphics for this game it was just \"wow\".  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as.  They both have 2 parts(kina).  Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character.  The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game.  The game has some great twists that'll keep you up all night.  Lemmi make it easier for you...Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever.  It had an awesome story line, sweet graphics and decent dialoug.  It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game.  In other words the game is awesome and scary.The graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid.  The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before, not to mention the bloody gore in this game....jeez.  Capcom did a great job making the graphics.  kudose..The gameplay is what really made me love this game.  Gun n' down zombies and solving puzzle...my type of game baby.  The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool.  The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool.  The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining.  Mainly cause it's just runing away from zombies but later on that will change...trust me..The sound is incredible!  The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecent(my spelling sucks I know).  The sound it self deserves a one star...What turned me off was the \"kina cheezy sci fi\" story.  It didn't have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil 1 had in story...which causes me to take off one star...Well yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey that's my opinion...The games has amazing graphics, great sound, lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series.  Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then It's 3.This game deserves a4.8 out 5....Resident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it.  I personaly think it's one of the best gaming series out but I don't have ALL the resident Evil games.. The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have areAnd for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series, if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with that...then 2, 3 then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil game...WellLates..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"mega action","reviewText":"The original Mega Man is probably not a classic truth be told.  The game unfortunately feels lacking in several areas compared to MM2, 3, 4 and 5.  The backgrounds are a little boring and repetitive, the gameplay feels slower than what you've come to expect later on and maybe even choppy at times, the amount of enemies are few and far between, and the music is probably not up to par either.  However I believe it's completely forgiveable for a debut to have these problems, especially since it's Mega Man we're talking about here- the action-packed series that satisfied most of our heart-pumping explosion cravings in the 80's and early 90's.  We also need to realize this game was probably a major influence for all the robotic-themed video game series released several years later.  I can't say this with absolute certainty- only knowing this game was highly praised back in the day allows me to assume it was influential to some extent.Yes, you only have 6 bosses and stages compared to what would quickly become the standard (8), but these stages offer a wonderful challenge and gameplay basically the same as Mega Man 2.  To give an example of the games difficulty, these flippable platforms appear early on in one stage that will SURELY force you to lose in controller-slamming fashion until you figure out how they function.  Losing is quite alright though- this game is part of the rough and tough \"expect no mercy\" gaming experience from the mid to late 80's.  This period of gaming is exactly what made the NES so awesome.  It wasn't really about completing the game for many of us- it was about how far we'd be able to progress.This game also uses a points system which seems really odd but again, Capcom didn't know at the time that a point system wasn't really necessary so I can't fault it- only ignore it.  Great start.  Please though, make sure you enter these stages with the correct weapon or you probably won't survive.  Why is this, you wonder?

More than just a cutting-edge game system, Xbox 360 also integrates high-definition video, DVD movie playback, digital music, photos, and online connectivity into one sleek, small tower, and in the process puts true Next-Gen power right at your fingertips.Xbox 360, shown with wireless controller, is a sleek, customizable gaming and entertainment systemUnder the HoodXbox 360 is much smaller than its predecessor--it measures approximately 3.3 by 12.2 by 10.2 inches and weighs 7.7 lbs. It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second.

{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are. This minor flaw doesn't detract from the  game's excellent value, though.Sonic Advanceoffers a very good  single-player game and some of the best link options of any GBA title.--Raymond M.

It really is a great game!Story-An adventuresome guy name Bartz with his pet chocobo come across a girl named Lenna who is being attacked by monsters.  He helps save her, and once they get away from the monsters a meteor crashes to the earth, and the two find an old man there named Galuf who has amnesia.  They try to find out why Galuf was at the meteor and come across pirates in which they befriend the leader Faris.  Eventually, the four of them find out that they have been chosen to save four crystals.  They set off to save them and get powers in the meantime by having jobs with everything from black mages to white mages to knights to monks to dancers.  You gain more jobs as the game goes on.  The point of the game is to stop an evil being who will come back to life if all four crystals are shattered.  So save those crystals!  But there are several back stories so you won't get bored.Graphics-The backgrounds are good, but the characters are rather small.  I liked the graphics, and I thought that they fit the game well.Sound-The music was nice, I thought.  The songs were mostly happy, and although they played quite a few times, I never got sick of them.Gameplay-Walking around is really easy, as is talking to people.  Now fighting is pretty easy as well.  You select the characters and they can attack, do one of 2 special moves that comes from levelling up in the jobs, or use items.  To level up in jobs you stock up in ABPs(ability points) which you get from completing battles.  You also get EXPs when you complete battles (experience points).  These help you gain experience levels which improve your HP (health points) and MP (magic points) and other stats such as defense, strength, and more.  Your attacks can differ with the weapons you have equipped.  The weapons that you can equip are based on the job that you are part of at that time.  For instance knights can equip swords, summoners can equip bows, while freelancers can equip everything.  There are a few other things that you will have to learn as you play the game, but these are the basics.Fun-Yeah!  This game is fun!  The story is fun, the levelling up of jobs is rewarding, and it just is a great game.Length-The story length is probably 30+ hours, but you probably won't play it straight through, as you might get stuck once or twice, but it's always solvable.  And the boss battle is very tough.  Too tough, in my opinion, which is why I took off a star.  You might question whether that is a valid reason.  When you get to it, you'll understand!All in all, this is a great game that I recommend to all.  It has strategy, fighting, and fun.  I definitely recommend it for $30 or less.  It's definitely a steal for anything less.  Great game that is fun for all!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2010"}

In hindsight, I don't actually believe Chrono Trigger is nearly good as I once did when I was a kid, but it still blows this game out of the water.I didn't hate this game either, don't get me wrong, but its just not there. The graphics for the time were amazing I suppose and the battle system is different(often to the point of annoyance), but different isn't always good. They tried to create a plotline as lofty and intricate as something like Xenogears. You go to so many places and meet WAAAAAAY too many party members to the point where they all seem to lose their respective \"face.\" You only really need the first two main party members and then pick one more from the other gazillion to form your party. Honestly, I thought the choice to add so many potential members was quite stupid. Also, I feel the storyline is too confusing. Havign beat this game a few years ago I remember almost nothing of what actually happened except for the fact I had already forgotten about most of it before I was even doen with the game, which usually doesn't mark a very enthralling affair in my eyes.Many people love this game, and I suppose if you try to play it as a game set apart from the Chrono \"franchise,\" as it were, it is a fair stand-alone outing. The Chrono tag is merely a means to an end, however, it is there to sell the game. This game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel. I would not recommend this game as a good rpg to start off on if you've never played one before. If you want the best of the best rpg's then go pick up Persona 3, FF7/FFX/FFXII, Xenogears, Star Ocean, or Suikoden 2/3/5, to name a few.

An airborne division of the PLA lands to claim the island as the sovereign possession of the People&rsquo;s Republic. Russia turns to the US for support aid and they&rsquo;re quick to respond.

Yeah, yeah... Arma 2 this, Arma 2 that... none of that makes Op Flash a bad game.Contrary to what you will read or have heard there are no post-patch game-affecting issues with the AI in Operation Flashpoint. The people that say it's broken, it's buggy, it's unresponsive are flat wrong and have been playing garbage like Call of Duty so long that they have no idea what AI actually is or how it ought to function.OpFlash has a morale system. That means you're squadmates are only as effective at carrying out your orders as you are effective at leading them properly. If you suck, they're going to suck. If you're a good leader, they're going to be good followers. If you give them stupid orders they will either care them out poorly or refuse to carry them out altogether. LISTEN TO YOUR SQUADMATES. They will give audible clues as to how they feel about your leadership. That's how it is and anybody telling you different is wrong. I mean, we ALL have the same game so there is no reason that I and many others can play the game, even on hardcore, and have zero issues with AI while so many others play on easy and have nothing but. It's completely illogical.After patching, this game has the best, most intuitive and effective AI I have ever encountered in a console ported game. Your squadmates, when led properly are the most effective, accurate and reliable of any console game ever developed and while Codemasters ought to be run through a wringer for their lack of post release support for this game they deserve nothing but praise for it's AI programming.Enemy AI is complex, intuitive and challenging. That's right kiddies, I said, \"challenging\". This means no running out into the middle of the street with SMG in one hand and frags in the other. Sorry but you're going to have to think and plan. There is no hand holding (aim-assist) or RPG-proof body armour in Op Flash.Kinda sick and tired of all the little 15 year old ADHD-riddled, CoD addicts (and I know that all of you aren't) that have never had an encounter with REAL AI badmouthing this game because it requires learning, effort and skill.At any rate, the game is not perfect. The vehicles are weak to the point of being unuseable in most situatons and the controls complement their uselessness wonderfully. There are a couple of missions with timed objectives and this is pretty stupid but not gamebreaking. Your character is too slow to swap weapons, reload, etc. but you'll get used to it.The command radial on the console controller DOES take some getting used to but they all do really. There are a large number of commands to be issued in this game and making them all work with a controller takes some doing but once you play it enough you'll get them figured out and can issue commands with no trouble at all.You'll have to learn proper formations, spreads, fire orders, how to engage at long range, use terrain as cover, set up ambushes, when to engage, when to evade and when to fallback, etc, etc. It's not an arcade shooter and you absolutely cannot play it like one. You just can't and all these one and two star reviews are coming from people that are trying to. As a result nothing is working for them, ESPECIALLY the AI and they think the game is broken because of it. Well, I can't say that for certain because I haven't read every 1 or 2 star review for this game on Amazon but I'm not taking out what I just said either. There's no shortage of Arma-snots out there either that will reject the game no matter what.The combat is challenging, gritty and intense and unlike anything else available except for Arma 2 (the TRUE successor to the Flashpoint franchise) which is stupidly complicated, not to mention a PC exclusive. Yes, I have it so I can call it whatever I want to.Even now, this is the best shooter out there. Original Ghost Recon and original SOCOM is about the only thing you could ever compare to it... and talk about bad AI. SOCOM was some baaaaad AI but the game was still good.I'm telling you that the game is not broken, the AI is not wrought with bugs. Anybody that says different doesn't know what they are talking about and you can rest assured that they suck at this game. It's not without it's imperfections - no game is but it is not nearly the buggy, broken mess than 75% of the peole that have played it will tell you that it is.BTW, if you decide to get this game (and any shooter fan that at least thinks he has any skills must play it at least once) there is a bonus content button on the min menu. Go to it and where it asks for it type in this: BLEEDINGBADLY. It'll open up something like 6 to 8 additional side missions called FTEs or Fire Team Engagements. They're very good for practicing all the things you'll need to know how to do in order to be successful at this game.So, you can either pass on it because some incompetent CoD fanboys who have yet to fit into their big-boy pants can't get past mission 1 or you can take my word for it and play the thing but one thing is for sure: If you do play it and finish it you will have accomplished something worthy in the realm of video games (even on easy). If not, if you choose to continue shooting mindless CoD bots in a 5 hour campaign or whiney 14 year olds in MP, then you have accomplished.... well... nothing.End of Transmission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2011"}

In it, you just bop from place to place, with some platforming and macguffin hunting (here, it's light seeds), mixed with some combat sequences.The platforming is quite good. The levels are on a large scale and there are various paths from where you are to where you need to go. It's all well designed and fun. The macguffin hunting after you clear out an area is actually quite fun too. The combat is actually the most intense part of the game, built around a rhythmic combat system based on attacks and parries.The biggest thing of note here is that you don't die. Nope, Elika bails you out every time. Because of this, it turns the game into a relaxing sprawl across beautiful environments.

The game really was a bit frustrating at first, as the same for its real surprising sequel for Nintendo's Gamecube.Super Monkey Ball 2, follows suit the exact same way the previous one does, as you control one of four monkey through difficult courses, inorder to make it to the goal. It seems easy, but some of the courses were just extrodinarily difficult. The game itself at times, could also be frustrating, as you try to score play points for unlocking a series of party games.

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Disabled Smurf \"Chato\"","summary":"Frustrating but somewhat fun","reviewText":"The game graphics are very well done.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"Unique, and overall satisfying","reviewText":"Eternal Darkness is a definite \"one of a kind\" game.  And that's got to be the best thing going for it.  The idea that your character can actually lose their sanity puts an interesting twist on what could have been just another \"good\" game.  The whole idea and implementation of the sanity effects pushes ED into a class of it's own.The game itself kind of feels like a cross between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.  With similar control and the 3-D environments.  It's not as freaky as Silent Hill, but I did at times get some goose bumps from the screams that were in the background when my character was losing it.  And there are a variety of different effects that can happen when your character does lose their sanity.  But don't let anyone tell you what they are if you plan on playing it yourself, it is better to experience them for yourself and be surprised.After while of losing your sanity and seeing what happens, you don't trust the game anymore.  An interesting idea.  I have never seen a game where I didn't trust what it was showing me.  This effect of the sanity is the main selling point I believe in Eternal Darkness.  It's a good game, even if that wasn't present, but it would lose a lot of its \"punch\" without it.After a while though you pretty much know when the game is showing you some hallucination and while it's neat to watch, sometimes you just want it to be over and get on with playing.  So you have to heal your Sanity Levels up quite often.  The monsters you encounter drain your sanity by just looking at you, and you sanity goes down so fast that you could lose a lot of sanity in a short period of time.  This is most likely what the producers had in mind, so that your character go insane faster, but sometimes you wish that you could just get through an area without losing so much sanity.The story, while not ground breaking is pretty interesting.  How they tie together 12 different character from different points in time to one flowing storyline is quite well done.  The characters that you play as play very similar to each other, except with some small variances, like a heavy person running out of breath sooner than someone who is in better shape.  Again, while this is neat, after a while it seems like that all the characters are pretty much the same with no real advantages to anyone in particular.  There are small differences but not enough to feel like you are playing as someone totally different and unique.The graphics are very good.  The character models are a bit clunky on some of the characters, but most of them are at least adequate.  They aren't gong to amaze you like Resident Evil, but they aren't the worst either.  The environments are where the graphical power of ED is shown.  The backgrounds and environments are great to behold.  To light reflecting in mirrors, to mist rolling across the floor, the environments are a sight to see.  The only problem is, you keep going over the same environments throughout the game.  While you play with 12 different characters, you are pretty much covering the same areas with most of them.  There are some differences, but a lot of it seems to be about in the same places.  They are a few different \"main\" areas that the characters seem to cover.  One may go to one of the \"main\" areas while another character may go to the other one.  But that's one thing that could have been better, to see different areas instead of just a few.Overall though I would say that ED is worth getting and adding to your GameCube collection.  I won't say it's the best game ever, because it's not, but it is a very good game with some minor flaws, but most games do have them right?  I know I sound a bit critical of the game, but I really did like it.  I just didn't find it nearly as fun to play as the Resident Evil for the GameCube.  And I don't see myself going through the game again anytime soon, I didn't see any replay value there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2002"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMR6Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Mixed Bag","reviewText":"This game is a sequel toGolden SunandGolden Sun: The Lost Age, both for the Gameboy Advance. I do not own a Gameboy Advance, nor do I own a regular DS, so I have never played these games. I understand that they're really really good, but I only know this from hearsay. All that I've got to judge the series on is this game. And it is a bit of a mixed bag.The gameplay here is pretty clever. Your characters are given psynergy based on a specific element which allows them to do special moves. Earth adepts for example can move certain rocks, air adepts can blow flowers into the air making elevated paths etc. It leads to a lot of creative puzzles which is good. You gain new moves by collecting djinns, which you then attach to one of your characters. Think Pokemon except they help you fight instead of fighting for you. The mechanics of this are too complicated to get into in a brief review, but they are not too difficult to master. None of the fights are that difficult until the last one, at which point you better hope you've been leveling up enough!The characters in this game are pretty good. Matthew is your PC, and as such he never speaks. Just like Link. I could get real sick of this... On the plus side they do give you options as to how emotionally he'll respond: hyper, happy, indifferent, or angry. None of these matter, but they'll get a slightly different reaction out of whoever you're talking to and make you feel a bit more like you're controlling him. Matthew is also an earth adept. Karis is a wind adept who is basically the sensible one of the party. Tyrell is a fire adept, and extremely impulsive and volatile. They all appear to be children of the previous leads of the series.I like these characters. The only real problem I have characterwise is that we never get to see them interact. There are a few moments of character interaction (mostly towards the beginning of the game) but almost all dialogue is plot driven. And the plot is interminably boring and repetitive.In the previous games you saved the world by restoring alchemy, or so I understand. This did bad things to the world but was probably better than an apocalypse so you're in the clear. In this game, your quest is equally epic and thrilling. You're to recover the feather of a mountain roc so that you can repair your glidery thing. Yup, that is actually the entire plot right there. At the end of the game you're returning with that darn feather. Actually, the sheer inconsequentiality of the main quest is one of the funnier things about the game. Obviously you encounter worse problems on your way and end up having to save the world (this is an RPG after all) but the main quest remains something basic that feels like it should take five minutes. The problem is that the epic part of the plot doesn't kick in for way way too long leaving your characters drifting through a world with no real purpose. It's boring. They needed to introduce the real danger a whole lot earlier instead of just having you waste your time on contrived sidequests.For the first maybe third of the game you are trapped beneath a mountain range. There are three cities here and nothing else. You have to go from city to city and back to activate the device that will get you over the mountain. There's no sense of threat or danger, and nothing to keep the player interested. Then you get over the mountain and things slowly start to kick off. I did find myself enjoying the game by the end, but it took too darn long to get there and I'm not sure it was worth it. The guy who turns out to be the main villain is somebody from the first game, and I had to have my roommate who's played it explain to me who he was. The rest of the game is very open to new players, but this guy gets no explanation at all. He doesn't reveal his identity til the very end and I was like meh? Then you beat the boss and the game ends abruptly with a major cliffhanger, setting up a sequel that shows no sign of being released anytime soon. It's entirely unsatisfying.I did like the game by the end. The plot wasn't too bad apart from the horrible pacing issues. If a sequel came out I would play it, if only to see where they were going with this. The gameplay was fun and the characters entertaining. If they include a decent plot next time (and they certainly seem to be going somewhere with this) then it could be one of the best RPGs released on that console. As it stands, this game is part brilliant, part terrible. The brilliant outweighs the terrible though, and leaves it as merely good. A shame given its potential.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2013"}

Basically, the gameplay throughout each installment involves:1. Lots of combat and cartoony over-the-top violence2. Great jumping/platforming elements3. Satisfying and constant rewards/secrets4. Zany characters5. Upgradable, interesting, and multitudinous, weaponsWhile each entry in the series sticks to this basic format, it seems that each has done something a little different to keep things from getting stale game after game.  For example, the second game, Going Commando, offered some really fun races and space combat sequences that you could choose to enjoy and reward yourself with or mostly skip.  I found myself playing these mini-games just for the fun of them long after the story no longer required it to be played.  Up your Arsenal featured multiplayer and drivable vehicles that stayed true to the wacky cartoony nature of the game, but still nailed it with the destructive satisfaction of blowing stuff up.With A Crack in Time, the story continues where Tools of Destruction left off with a intro movie to get you up to speed if you missed the previous titles.  You were left with a bit of a cliffhanger at the end of the last game and this one answers everything.  Actually, this is really the only entry in the series in which the story is a direct sequel to one previous.  The other games were all separate adventures and could more or less be played in any order, although you would miss out in comic references to other events, recurring characters, and anecdotes, but otherwise would be fine. The story is a little deeper as well.  You are now getting into more details about where you and Clank came from and the fate (or destiny) of the Lombax race. The developers seem to be moving into some deeper material here.My only complaint about games through the series is that while they retain some recurring characters that we all love, sometimes other interesting characters from previous games don't make an appearance at all. For example, In Tools of Destruction, you are told that you are the only Lomax left in existence, however in a previous game; there was a female Lombax, Angela Cross, who was a pretty cool character.  She inexplicably never appears again in the series.  Captian Qwark more than makes up for this, however.  He redeems himself fully in this title.  Sure, he is still a coward that tries to take credit for everything, but you get the feeling that he is starting to realize it.  He also helps you out much more this time around.A Crack in Time dials in everything that made the other games so much fun, without question and finally adds trophies.  Everyone should give this series a chance because the constant rewards, the non-frustrating yet so satisfying gameplay, and zany characters are all here in full force.  There are clever puzzles in which you can use time devices to create other selves to help you push buttons to open doors.  We have generous use of the grindrails traditional to the series which are fast and furious linear where you skate around from place to place, usually while you are being chased down. Space combat is back and they did a decent job with it.  One complaint is that you cannot move vertically, but the areas to offer a decent variety and beautiful backgrounds and allow you to land on all the moons in each system hunting for hidden items and other things. They made it more sandbox-like in that you can either fly around aimlessly or decide to stop and get some side missions.  These areas are all completely optional and you can come back to them any time. While doing so, you have access to several radio stations that, even after 2 play throughs, I was still hearing newscasts, interviews with Captain Qwark and music that I had not heard before.  Pure polish.Clank has always been your pal and he can pull his own weight when not attached to your back which is good because a large part of the game involves Clank not stuck to Ratchet's back, but rather dong his own thing.  His elements are much different from the Ratchet portions of the game.  Clank is less combat oriented and his levels involve more platforming and puzzles.  He is a good character and his sections are a fun distraction from the comic mayhem going on with Ratchet.The real robot in this game is Mr. Zurkon.  Mr. Zurkon was featured as a limited use gadget in ToD, but is now an equipable weapon that can upgrade over time with the rest. He is basically a deployable sadistic killer robot that will constantly taunt your enemies and laugh at them when they explode.  He has plenty to say and always has your back.  He loves to kill things and listening to him is hilarious.  These are the polished touches you can expect with this game.Without spoiling anything, the ending of the game was probably the most epic among the stories told so far.  When a game can bring a tear to my eye and a smile to my face, the game definitely deserves to be recommended to others. I can't wait for the next one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

My only problem with it is they put all media in one folder, that includes games, movies, music, and they are only organized by most recently used.  I own 5 games, and i often use Netflix so basically 6 files keep jumping around in random order.  I like having them separate for quick access like the PS3.Streaming: I use Amazon, Netflix, and Crunchyroll.  All of them work fine just like the PS3 with similar designs, but a lot fast UIs.The News Feed: Think Facebook but about trophies.  This could be an interesting feature, but i only have one friend, myself on my japanese account, so i get constant updates about myself, its kind of annoying honestly and would love to be able to turn it off.Install speed: I was worried when i learned that the games have to do a full install now but was pleasantly surprised that when i loaded up Killzone a 40GB game, it started with only a few second delay and installed while I played.HardDrive: The 500GB harddrive it simply too small, with each exclusive being 40GB to install, my 3 disc based games already filled up 100GB of space.  With the required installed this new generation i'm expecting to be spending to much time managing the hard drive or replacing it.  I do like that they allow the hard drive to be replaced instead of needing to buy entirely new system though.Downloads: the PSN store is identical to the PS3 store in design, but much faster. my only gripe is that it doesn't have the full store, so PS3, Vita, PSP games aren't anywhere to be found.  Hopefully this will be updated when the Vita is even more intermingled.  I have not bought a full game off the PSN store yet, so i'm not sure how the play as you download works yet.Updates: I'm mixed.  The update system is automatic and can be done in the background.  so if you just want to play, you can start up and the update will be installed when you exit out.  My worry is updates especially the sony ones have a history of crashing systems and having an updates installed automatically is a recipe for disaster in my option.Trophies: I'm loving the new trophy rank system.  But again it has no organization, and is based on most recently played games, so again its a random mess and trying to find older games to oogle is a pain. And the only option is to have my trophies compare with a friend, and considering i'm my only playstation friend it's a bit lonely reminder.Controller: I actually really like the DualShock 3, and this one just feels like a fat version of that, with a giant touch button in the middle.  The touch button feels great and works a lot better then i expected.  Assassin creed uses it for its map, and it works just like a smart phone which just feel right.  I was impressed that the two games i own that use it didn't feel like gimmicks.  It also has a small speaker, that currently feels gimmicky.  In Resogun the announcer's voice comes out of the tiny speaker, and in Killzone audio logs are read through it.  But nothing interesting coming out of it yet.  My only gripe is the Bright Blue light coming out of the controller.  its kind of cool design wise, but when i was playing Killzone and one of the kind of scary scene was happening the TV went dark and my room turned blue killing the atmosphere.  Also while watching movies the light still shines, making it a constant reminder that its there.  I'd love for it to be disabled while playing certain types of games like survival horror and during my Netflix watching.  I'm trying to avoid taping it, but i'd not hold it against myself if i have to.Design: Personally think its ugly, not as ugly as the XBox One that looks like a VCR, but really close.  I miss the space age look of the PS3 Slim. I do like the light bar in the middle, i think it gives it a nice touch.Remote Play: Works... can be spotty though.  I played assassin Creed while taking dropping some kids off at the pool and it worked well.  about a 30 ft distance over a private wifi connection.  I moved to my kitchen on the second floor and played Contrast while i was cooking and i found my character randomly running into walls and not jumping when i pressed X.  Thats said i was able to beat the first level with out any really annoyances.  Killzone on the other hand wasn't quick enough and i found getting a head shot was more difficult, i was able to finish the snipper mission though using remote play.Blu-rays and DVDs: both play fine.  But just like all Playstations before it, the controller is a terrible way to control movie watching, expect to bump it and skip a chapter, or accidentally fast-foward.So these are my thoughts.  I'll update if any thing significant happens.  But as of right now the hardware seems very promising, and after a few hundred updates should be working like clock work.  I just wish it had a better organized UI, the Controller light could be turned off, a larger hard drive and the store have a more dynamic library even if the system can't play them.  But i'm very excited about the new generation of games coming out. If your on the fence, I'd recommend waiting till the Infamous bundle comes out in March by then this generation should be having a ton more new games coming out.  as of right now the library is a bit light.PS i currently only own the PS4, but will buy the Xbox when it comes down in price for the exclusives.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

The game itself is in a normal case inside the tin, so the game can be removed and the tin utilized however wanted (for instance, Dark Soul cookies).-Comes with a small art book that features many of the grotesque creatures in the game, final art, and conceptual art.

There is also a card for redeeming said downloadable items.Considering that this was a free upgrade when it was first released (I pre-ordered my copy), the additions were a very nice set of free gifts.  I am a huge fan of this series and would have gladly paid $10 more for the tin, artbook and soundtrack (the guide, in my opinion, is opposite of the purpose of the game which is exploration and learning and the behind the scenes I don't really care about).For a fan of the series, I would maybe spend $10 more than what Dark Souls retails currently, but I certainly wouldn't pay more than that for the few \"extras\" one receives.

Final Fantasy XII proves that this series can present an awesome storyline and graphics that all ages will adore.Don't worry if you haven't played all of the other Final Fantasy games. You don't need to. There are subtle carry-overs, but this game is meant to stand alone. You are a young orphan in a city recovering after a war. The cruel Empire has taken over your home town, and you enjoy causing trouble for the soldiers.Soon, of course, you're swept up in an epic rebellion. The storyline here is just *amazing*. Not just the plot itself, but the voice acting, the dialogue, the graphics, they are top notch. This is really like being a part of an extremely well done drama movie. They delve into issues of honor, loyalty, love, betrayal, and more. I'm an adult gamer, and I was staying up many long nights because I wanted to see where the story was going. Some of the subtle interactions between characters in cut scenes are just amazing. The small nods, the looks in their eyes, you are hard pressed to remember that they are animated in a computer game.Gameplay itself revolves around a party of characters going on quests, fighting in battles and moving through the large world. Each character gains experience and skills as they go. You buy them new weapons and armor, train them in spells, and aim them in their career growth however you wish. There is a dual system in play here. First, you need to physically own the weapon or item you wish to use - say an iron sword. But then you need to KNOW how to use it too! You can't just hand an iron sword to a 10 year old piano player and expect her to know how to use it. That skill is called a \"license\". You have an online license chart that lets you manage what each character knows. Licenses relate to each other. If your character learns the basics of sword work, now they can learn a more advanced version. It is very intuitive and adds a fun element to the game. It's not just one straight line that you choose and are stuck with. It's an all-directions layout where you can try new skills or expand out as you learn the system better.I really like combat in this Final Fantasy as well. Instead of random battles where enemies appear out of nowhere to assault you, all enemies are \"on the map\" with you. If you're running along a path in the desert and see something really scary in the distance, you run away from it! You don't have to worry about enemies springing up out of nowhere to slam you into the ground.The enemies in general are challenging but not impossible. There are spots where you really have to think about the enemy and what its weakness is to defeat it. You can't just brute force bash away at everything and hope to succeed.Still, as great as the gameplay is, and as gorgeous as the visuals and music and voice acting are, I really have to come back to the plot and characters as standing out here. There's been a lot of talk in the gaming world about a game that finally goes from \"little pixels on the screen\" that you move from X to Y to the point of *caring* about these characters, about what they are going through, and feeling emotional about their highs and lows. I really think Final Fantasy XII has hit that level. Yes, there are one or two twerpy characters that can be annoying. Even Star Wars had Luke whining about the Takashi Station at the beginning, to set his \"basis for growth\". In general, though, every single character here seems real, seems complex, and you don't want to put the game down.Highly, highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"An Avid 20 year SF Fan - I gotta be honest,....","reviewText":"Pros:Updated graphicsNew charactersIt's a new Street Fighter!!Cons:Poor controlsAnnoying soundtrackLacks Street Fighter charmWatered down gameplay feelNot many new innovationsI was really excited about the emergence of a new Street Fighter game after being part of the entire early 90's SF2 Arcade hoopla as well as all it's official and \"unofficial\" remakes, Alphas, Supers, EX's, Marvel tie-in's etc etc (long time SF fans know what I mean). After the release of Street Fighter 3 in the late 90's I was even more excited. I wondered \"how can they possibly outdo the genius of SF3??\" Truth is - they didn't.Upon first looking at the screen shots and synopsis' of SF4, I first wondered if this was a true sequal or simply a Street Fighter 2 remake? I mean, it's basically the same deal as the release of Super Street Fighter 2 - bring back all the original characters and introduce 4 new ones. Granted, in SF4, plenty more are unlockable. But it doesn't end there. The big problems lie in the fact that there really isn't anything new Capcom has brought to the table... not only that, but they actually managed to make the gameplay slower, clunkier, less responsive, and nowhere near as skill-based as in SF3. And WHAT IS THIS about no bonus stages???!! No more beating up a car for bonus points? No more breaking piles of barrels or parrying basketballs or ANYTHING of that sort that were staples of earlier SF games??? What were they thinking!?First thing's first most gamers will notice - the controls. As all PS3 owners know, the L2 and R2 triggers aren't simply buttons anymore like the Dualshock 2 (ps2), but triggers that depress even longer and pressure-sensed optimal for actions games like FPS shooters. Playing SF3:Anniversary Edition on my PS2 is super crisp and responsive, yet playing SF4 makes my controller feel clunky and broken. The L2 and R2 buttons literally LACK RESPONSE about 50% of the time! I mean, I'll be crouched, I'll hit the L2 button to sweep and nothing will happen. Plus, pulling off Ultra-combo attacks which need you to push these triggers also only work half the time - you'll literally sit there trying them over and over mid-match because the D-pad just isn't responding quickly enough. Why is this????? Weren't SF games always known for their super-crisp controls??? I think I know the answer - the SF Tournement joystick controller. This new controller can be purchased separately (well, for a hefty price considering they're no longer in stock anywhere) and promises to give way better response (as I've been told by friends who have the joystick). I'm sure it does - and it wouldn't surprise me if Capcom went out of their way to make the controls this clunky simply so that we'll all go out and pay another $150 for a joystick controller. Sorry guys, it's not gonna work on me, I'm not that stupid.Point being - the controls, while mostly functional, are a huge letdown especially since pulling off those super combos were always so much fun and I never had to worry about doing it JUST RIGHT to get it to work.Next flaw - the \"improved\" graphics. Ok, where in the world did the idea come to make these characters so cartoony and SUPER beefy that they don't even look healthy enough to be fighting?? I mean, you wanna make bigger characters, that's fine, but what's with the cartoony look with them all? Close-ups make them look super exaggerated and somewhat retarded looking (Ken appears to have some sort of birth defect, as well as others). Their muscles and bodies are way too exaggerated to be taken seriously, and the way they contrast with the backgrounds doesn't even feel real enough. There is no shadowing of any sort to make the characters look ANY different whether they're fighting night or day, indoor or outdoor - they all light the same, and feel more like cardboard cutouts than 3-dimensional beings. I feel this game could've had the same look on the PS2 or Xbox1. They may as well use the same background also because characters don't have their own personally set stages as in previous SF games. In the Championship mode, you simply don't get the FEEL that you're part of some grand tournement. That, plus the fact that you don't go through that many battles before you reach the end boss - Seth, who in SF3 had WAAAAAAAYYY more charm and character (in older games, there were more battles giving you a more \"yea i did it!\" feeling after you finally beat the game).In correlation with this - the sound has been greatly disproved. No longer do punches and kicks carry that OOMPH they once did - the hits sounds muffled and don't feel rewarding enough. Sure, it may sound more REALISTIC but SF games were never about realism like Tekken games. I want LOUD hitting sound effects, I'd rather not feel like I'm just punching a pillow. Along with more sound flaws, the music is downright terrible, nothing but a bunch of techno/electronic/house beats. The music does nothing to complement the atmosphere of where you're fighting. No more of the Sakura and Chun Li type cutsy music that brought so much atmosphere and charm to those old SF games.Which brings me to the next fault and probably the biggest flaw - the lack of SF charm. Back in the days of SF2 sequals and rehashes, there was always a certain charm to these characters, the way their stories were told and the way they fought and bad-a$$ looks on their faces during fights and such, but SF4 seems to be missing all that. The fact that ALL the original characters were brought back IN ALL THEIR ORIGINAL OUTFITS feels more like some high school reunion rather than a true world warrior tournement. Was it really necessary?? Why is this a SF2 remake and not a REAL sequal like SF3?? Sure, I know the complains from SF3 - that while there were all new characters none of them were very good to use. But besides that, SF3 really improved the gameplay, charm, and crisp feel of SF2. The graphics were somewhat more cartoony but not super-exaggerated steroid-induced parodies of original characters like this game tends to do. Characters in SF3 had good and cool little details, like swaying clothes and determined faces. All the SF4 characters have are these goofy smiles that makes it look like their just there to have fun and be remembered - \"hey look at me! I'm Chun Li!! remember me?!\"On top of this, SF3 also brought a great skill-based concept to the genre - the art of Parrying attacks. This was perfect because by tapping foward on the joystick the moment an attack hit, you could parry an incoming attack and have a split-second to respond. I felt this was a wonderful idea because it was easy for newbies to learn and also challenging to master for SF veterans. It's been stripped away in SF4 and instead replaced with a flimsy and tacked-on \"focus attack\" which is just tapping the two medium punch and kick buttons together to do an attack that can stun your enemy for a second, whereas you can hit him again if you'd like. It's more tacky than anything and really unnecessary. heck, if the controls were more responsive I'd be more excited, but considering I'm there trying 10 times to do an ultra combo and failing because I'm not rich enough to buy a $150 joystick I get stuck not being able to do half the moves because the game decides it doesn't want to respond well enough. In other words - they dumbed the gameplay down because they felt that parrying was \"too difficult\" (which is ridiculous) and now we're left with slowed down gameplay that is probably comparable to the original arcade version of SF2 (before they sped it up with the remakes).Overall - while SF4 definitely is a good fighter with some fun moments (2 player and online play is good), it's really a big disppointment than anything else. Unless you're an avid Street Fighter fan and need all its releases and sequals, I'd say pick this one up (or wait till the price drops), but if you're just a casual gamer looking for a fun fighter  - I recommend SF:Anniversary Edition for the Ps2 and Xbox1. SF3 not only plays very very similarly, it responds better and is just more fun overall. I should've bought Killzone 2 instead :(","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2009"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"C. Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Overhyped...","reviewText":"The reviews are in, and what they say is that Burnout 3 is the most incredible racing game ever made. What they don't say, is how it is rigged, the computer cheats, and vehicles are thrown at you for the hell of things. The action is intense, furious, and if you can keep your eye on the car, it is pretty fun gameplay mixed with incredible graphics and abysmal, I repeat, ABYSMAL in-game sound. But the best racer ever it is not.Burnout 3 is all about speed, speed, and more speed. Your car blazes through each course. (Or crashes through each course, depending on how many cheap shots the computer wants to take at you.) This game game rivals F-Zero GX in speed, but not in overall quality. The artificial intelligence, and the lack of originality, are some of the poorest productions on a system. Oh, plus the dreadful music.New features are introduced this time around, most notably being takedowns, where you do your best to bring your opponents down using a variety of different techniques, like slamming them into a wall. This is awesome to witness and pull off. Oh, at least for a couple of minutes.The sound is the worst in any game that I have. I think Pong does game music more justice than this garbage. But wait, Pong doesn't have music! Well, nothing is better than this. Punk from terrible bands, except for the one Jimmy Eat World track, are mixed around like waste in a toilet. No rap anywhere, pathetic bands, and even worse song to game matches are all you need to turn the sound OFF. Somebody do me a favor and kill that \"announcer\" while you're at it, will ya?Here's the bottom line. Burnout 3 is fun, if not impossible due to cheating shot constantly at the player. If you like racing, give this game a shot. It is hard to say stay away, but it is hard to recommend this standard and in some ways, very bad game, either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2004"}

Patiense","reviewText":"Frustration Vs. PatienceThis game is a balance between Frustration and Patience.  First off, this is a review for the single player mode and not the multiplayer mode.  If I were to play this with a friend I think I would have enjoyed it a ton more.  Just like borderland, that said none of my friends own this game, so I played alone.  I beat the main campaign and a large amount of the side quest by level 39, at 26 hours.Pro:*Grinding is addictive at first.  Became my only driving force by the end.*Has a stamina bar, it made me plan my attacks at the beginning of game.  Later on, it didn't affect me too much.* Melee combat feels really good.* The music is nice, and balanced well.* Driving is fun, and you get a car pretty soon on.  But, the car is weak and takes way to much work to kill a single zombie.Cons:*Enemies level with you, therefore, you never feel like a bad ass.*There is no way to block an attack, and for a melee combat game this gets really annoying every time you die.*You die constantly, without a friend you can't distract the enemies and hit them in the back, so expect to get hit by everything.*The missions are all the same, even in the last act, I was still doing fetch quest and kill that guy missions.*Enemy variety is terrible; there are 5 kinds of enemies and one boss for the entire game.* Guns seems cool when you get them, but they are never powerful enough to make them useful.  Also they are really awkward to use.Mixed:*You can kick.  A useful move, but later in the game it becomes useless and simply detracts from your stamina.*Graphics are a total mixed bag, from the sewers that look terrible, and the beach that looks great.*Leveling is fun, but has no point because the enemies level with you.* Glitchy, sometimes it glitches in your favor, like a zombie stuck in a door that you can easily kill, other times it's a guy with a gun that just keeps shooting you until you find him.Final conclusion: I found myself more determined to beat the game, simply to beat the game, rather then playing because I actually enjoyed the experience.  If you're playing with friends I'd recommend this game, the pitfalls won't feel as deep, but alone, it's completely not worth it.  And unless my friends stop being scared of zombies, I'll probably never buy the second one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

FPS goodness at it's finest (on a console, no less).  What's Not to Like: Getting used to the controller rather than a mouse/keyboard combo. Every home in America that has an Xbox should not go without Halo.  Microsoft acquired Bungie in order to get this game on Xbox, and after playing it, you can definitely see why. First off, you'll notice the somber music and graphics.  The graphics are amazing-as in better than what you've seen on a PC.  They are just incredible to look at and you'll drool in awe. Now, let's talk about the gameplay: in the beginning you'll awake from your cryo-sleep and you'll have to knock out the cobwebs by re-training your systems.  (What a great way to do a tutorial).  Then you'll see one of your fellow crewmen get killed as the evil Covenant troops overrun your ship.  Next you'll have to get off the ship, but of course the Covenant are after you-and boy are they smart.  You'll have other troops with you helping your cause and they actually protect you with covering fire and suppressing fire. You can hide behind obstacles and take cover, but in later missions, you are attacked from above so be careful.  You are only allowed two different weapons to carry at one time and boy you'll find a huge number of weapons to choose from, adding another strategic element to the game.  Grenades aren't considered a weapon so you also have them in your arsenal.  Weapons are as lame as an 'energy pistol' and move up to more impressive guns, such as a very cool sniper rifle that lets you zoom in up to 10x and really pick your targets. Of course you don't have to go in all guns a blazin', instead you can also sneak attack and take out some of the Covenant baddies.  The sounds these guys make can help you out in order to determine their location, especially with the bad guys I like to call clowns, and when you play the game, you'll see why I call them that. The levels of the game are incredibly deep and there's no one way to finish a level, which adds immensely to the replay value.  The game is very challenging as the Covenant soldiers don't act the same way twice, and I mean that in a good way: they react to where you are and what you are doing. Halo isn't just a first person shooter-in fact you'll also have to do a bit of driving of certain vehicles in order to get where you want to go.  The Warthog is a nice vehicle with one problem-the gun is in the back.  Since you can't be in two places at the same time, you should go on a quest and find some other troops that have crashed in the forest so they can operate the gun.This is the great thing about Halo-the missions make a heck of a lot of sense and you'll enjoy your time playing it. While I enjoyed my time in a single player quest, a multiplayer split screen option is also available (sorry, no internet play yet).  Everything looked smooth and enjoyable in the cooperative mode as well.  You can link multiple players and Xboxes together using the system link, but I'm not sure how many will take advantage of this. Load times are very fast and you'll see the game auto save at various checkpoints which makes it a snap to stop and play again later. One of the biggest issues people have mentioned with any FPS on a console is \"Yeah, but it doesn't support a mouse and keyboard..\" The Xbox controller feels good in your hand and you'll find it very easy to play the game with.  The right trigger shoots, while the left trigger is your grenade button.  The left stick allows you to move while the right stick lets you look around.  It is very intuitive and not once during the game did I say \"I wish I had a mouse and keyboard.\" If there is any game that is a system seller, it is this one.  You need to have this game.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

I notified the seller, who sent a replacement cable, which works fine.  I did have to raise the PS2 off the top of our VCR (yes, we still have one) because there was some interference that was causing the picture some issues.  I just put a couple of small wooden blocks under the Ps2 and now it's fine.So, do these cables make a difference?  Yes, and it's worth the minimal investment to me.  If you don't tend to notice such things, then it might not be worth it to you, but text and subtle details are smoother and more defined.  To my eye it's a substantial improvement, but \"substantial\" only because I was never pleased with the way the Ps2 looked on the flatscreen.  I'd noticed a similar improvement by hooking our Wii up with component cables, and so gave this a try, and I'm glad I did.I followed the suggestions of others in these reviews:  1. changed output on the Ps2 to component from RGB, 2. turned off Ps2, 3. changed cable, 4. turned Ps2 back on and switched to appropriate input on the tv and voila - improved Ps2 visuals.I also have to give kudos to the seller, who replaced my cable immediately without questions.

Yes, the campaign is great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. What is the point of upgrading your car and getting good at it if you cannot take your car out for a challenge among your peers? You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow racers. This game clearly states the ability to race with up to 16 people. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that the XL edition only came out about two and half years, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony and'or PolyPHONY should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Gran Turismo 5 community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Gran Turismo iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Gran Turismo 6 customers. Same goes for Resistance which also fell to this bad business practice.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

Virtually everything that can be done offline can be done online.  It is the perfect combination of offline/online fun and provides the most integrated experience.In brief, the game allows you to play through a beautiful and cute story to learn the basics of the game, its physics system, and possibilities with its tools.  Providing you with both a play mode and create mode, one can either play levels, the ingame levels, as well as any online level, or one can spend their time creating their level and then putting it online.That is ultimately all that there is to this game, level creation and playing these levels.  The tools are out there and for those who do not want to take the time to make their own levels there are over 100,000 levels and growing that can be accessed online.  Just play them.  Speaking of multipleayer you can take as many people online as you have controllers for, so you can have 3 players on your one system and one online and you can play the levels.The DLC and support for the game has been implemented well and there are features being added virtually every few weeks. DLC is added every other week just about and caters to the season as well as to popular Sony and Playstation properties.This game is lovable, with the sack toys you can play and create, it has endless possibilities for level design and creation, and if you are good enough you can become an elite designer too.  I have not found a way to get tired of this game and key levels online make it a benefit to own.  Definitely go out and add this game to your PS3 collection today.Additional info:  The music is great, with several, \"regional songs\" that are great like, The Go Team's song as well as the song that plays in the canyon.

The hack n slash action in this game is satisfying, and did i forget to mention the blood flys when you slash someone? You seriously spray blood everywhere when your slicing someone up with Wolverine's claws. What fun! This game is literally what every Wolverine-related game should have been. Even though it wouldn't be Game Of The Year material that follows the same storyline as the movie in which it feels like \"seen it, don't need to see it again,\" you're really not gonna give a care as you go around, slashing people up. Kinda makes me wonder why the movie couldnt be like this?There really isn't anything in the way of replay value to justify coming back to this other than costumes to unlock and play as a Wolverine of your choice to replay the storyline. My best advice would be to just rent this if you're looking for a change of pace in your games, or if you're a Wolvie-diehard, it may be a full price game to you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

Up to eight players from eight different cities can compete head-to-head, either one race at a time or for an entire circuit.  Getting exploding-shelled at the last moment, then finding that mushroom you need and powering through the finish still in first place - this is quite a way to spend an afternoon.Then there's challenger mode, which works like a time trial except that the three ghosts racing against you are real people racing at the same time as you are.  You look for a 'room' without too many people, and take your place in line.  Then when your time comes, you take your place as one of three challengers, and race against the champion.  Whoever wins the race then becomes champion and gets to race again; the losers have to go back to the end of the line.  Then as champion you are challenged by three more challengers.  The first challenger in line gets to choose the track for the next race.  While you're waiting, you get to watch the current race from the champ's point of view.  It's a blast.But that's only in my dreams.  For now.  I will buy Nintendo's next home console, in the hope that they will get their online gaming in order.  And maybe the next system's Mario Kart game will work online something like this.  For now though, Mario Kart Double Dash is a very good (off-line only) game.  The action-packed, no-race-is-the-same-as-any-other gameplay is fun enough that I have kept playing long after unlocking everything (and there is a lot to unlock).  I thought that it might get too weird and complicated with two racers in each vehicle but it doesn't.  With such a huge lineup of characters and karts you will find one that works for you (mine is Luigi's baby buggy).  More challenge in Grand Prix mode could have given it even more replay value (250cc maybe?), but if you want more challenge you can try to score first in every race - the game keeps track.  That's not quite enough, but that's what multiplayer is for (more frantic challenge).  Don't think this game is just for young kids though -- in Time Trials just releasing the course ghosts is a challenge, and I have never come close to beating one.  I do wish there were more tracks.  This game isn't that flashy, won't thrill you, but is very, very fun.  But not online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FDOTN6","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Worst. Madden. Ever.","reviewText":"It pains me to write this review, since I have been playing Madden since the days of 8-bit consoles and the series' humble beginnings.  Madden could always be counted on for 1 thing: innovation without sacrificing the great core gameplay.  That's why gimmicky buttons and animations and minigames never really detracted too much from the overall Madden experience: the core game was solid and reliably fun and addictive.  No longer.  This iteration of Madden is the weakest yet, and truth be told, it is a disgrace to the Xbox 360's capabilities and the Madden name.  Try as I might, this game has so many flaws and holes that I just can't recommend it to anybody.  The bad has finally come to outweigh the good.The GOOD: Graphics.  They are really phenomenal, and the new animations are more fluid and realistic than ever.  The player models are well done, and on a HD television, this game is truly the closest we've come to photorealism.  The new ability to control other players on offense (such as a lineman, or a blocking fullback) is one of the few cool innovations.  I love being able to lead block for my HB (go Tiki Barber!), and it adds some depth to the gameplay.  The superstar mode also has something fun about it in an RPG kind of way, but it does wear thin pretty quickly. The new playbook organization is a great help, allowing you to choose a play based on play type, key player, formation.The BAD: Oh boy, where do I start?  In no particular order: there is only 1 camera angle.  That's it.  The new minigames stink up the joint and make the create-a-player feature all but useless.  Since your ratings are derived from your performance in 4 silly and difficult minigames, it is nigh impossible to create a playable character.  You also can't edit the existing rosters.  This means that this game has zero replay value, since you can't manually update the rosters to reflect player improvements, etc.  You can't save a game in progress, so be prepared to play through or lose all of your data.  The franchise mode is pathetically weak compared to previous years, and you can't adjust anything once the franchise has been started, it's set in stone.  The player AI seems to have regressed, especially when you are trying out the new (and fun) lead blocker feature.  Running backs will often cut back upfield into a tackle even though you have a perfect block on somebody.  Receivers similarly get tangled all the time, and playing defense is a losing proposition.  Defensive line players sometimes don't respond right at the snap, and trying to guard somebody manually just has never been feasible.  Also, there is no Madden in this game, just some really irritating guy trying to sound like Jim Rome.  The game tends to have graphical hiccups during transition scenes, and it takes forever for keypresses to register during menus.The UGLY: The menus and menu interface.  Just an unintuitive piece of junk, reflecting a recent trend in bad interface design from EA.The worst part?  Because of the EA sports monopoly on NFL licensed football games, we are stuck without a competitor to challenge Madden and really make it work for our money.  Shame on you, EA.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2006"}

You get WoW and expansion, which would cost 50 bucks if bought separately.  You also get two strategy guides, but the strategy guide for the expansion (see my review for it hereWorld of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Official Strategy Guide (World of Warcraft)) is terribly lacking, so we're really looking at one valuable guide, one crappy guide.  What you also get, and not even the box mentions this, is the game on DVD!  Oh, how many times I've installed and reinstalled the original WoW on multiple computers at home and at my friends place, swapping disks.  Well, no more!  Unless you were lucky and bought the original Collector's editionWorld of Warcraft Collector's EditionandWorld Of Warcraft Burning Crusade Collector's Edition, you're stuck with 4 CDs each instead of 1 DVD.Overall, I would buy (in fact, I did).Update December 2009:I've bought my 4th copy of this battlechest (yeah, I try to enlist friends and families to play WoW, so call me the Wow drug dealer....), which arrived the week before Thanksgiving 2009.  Instead of 2 DVDs (one for WoW and one for The Burning Crusade), you now get everything in one DVD, with the two activation codes both printed on separate labels on the DVD cardboard sleeve.  Not very different, but it's nice that they at least save a bit of plastic by packing it all in one disc.  Still comes with one month of play included, contrary to what the one comment on my review claimed.And until they release a new battlechest that will include Wrath of the Lich King (which I doubt Blizzard will do until right after they release their next expansion [to be titled Cataclysm {which I preordered my max of 3 from Amazon already!}]) this battle chest is still the deal to buy.  Also, in my opinion, including the Burning crusade makes sense, since it does include 2 new player races as well as their corresponding zones in Azeroth, which can be played from the beginning, whereas pretty much all of Wrath of the Lich King isn't available until you're at least lvl 55, and then Blizzard sinks in the extra hook.  Would have been nice if there was a battlechst that included all 3, since that would have potentially saved me money, but oh, well....Still greatly recommended for the person wanting to start playing WoW.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}

I'm generally really calm in gaming situations that would make people go mad, however trying to play through 30 rounds of the arcade mode just convinced me to nearly break my hand against my desk with rage. Pretty good choice, I'd say, considering how disgustingly obnoxious the CPU can be. Against other humans I'm fine, against some of the bots it's seemingly impossible to win. I build up my brave meter to 7000 earlier and one of the foes brave-breaked me with one across the map hit when he went into EX mode. Another character blocked every single brave attack I threw at him and then broke through all of my blocks with HIS brave attacks(Jecht) and then went on to attack me with some of the most obnoxious attacks the game has to offer, constantly saying stuff like \"comeoncomeoncomeon, one more time, here we go, gonna cry now, comeoncomeoncomeon.\" I'm currently in a fight with Onion Knight, he just spent a few minutes attacking me in midair, not even giving me a chance to dodge, attack him back or even fall back onto the ground.Dissidia is a disgusting beast. It could've been so much more but the game design is pretty much made so that anyone who plays this is bound to run into some of the most frustrating experiences a human being can have playing a game. I haven't been this frustrated at a game since Spyro: Season of Ice on my Gameboy Advance(I destroyed my Gameboy Advance after playing a segment over and over again and constantly losing). The game doesn't have much to offer most players anyways, the writing is horrendous, the voice acting's just as bad and the story is abhorrent, not only that but I cannot stand the character Lightning and she's all over the freaking game.Do not waste your money on this.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Psychic Cypher","summary":"Loads of fun!","reviewText":"This game is awesome. Far exceeded my expectations. It looked like a decent shooter that was reminiscent of most FPS games. I thought it might be a lot like Borderlands (which would not be a bad thing...Borderlands was awesome!), based on the \"points\" received for well-executed shots, along with the ability to upgrade equipment and/or abilities along the way. In that sense, it really is like Borderlands. But it's really a very different game overall...and not in a bad way. It's got its own identity, and a very high fun factor.The good:+The skillshot system is awesome. You can play the game like any other shooter, if you want, and ignore the skillshots altogether. But it's so much more fun if you embrace the skillshots and pursue them. Note that not all of these are actually \"skill\" based, so that's a bit of a misnomer. For example, one of them is to get a kill by shooting or kicking someone into a high voltage fence. This doesn't really require any skill...just taking advantage of the right timing and use of the environment. Some of them ARE skill-based, though, and even the ones that aren't don't make them any less fun to pursue. Watching a guy get frizzled on an electric fence is pretty cool, even if it doesn't really require me doing anything specific to make it happen.+Along with the skillshot system is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your equipment and (to a lesser extent) abilities (things like health and so forth). This is very cool, and gives the game a bit more depth than most shooters. It also give you a little bit more incentive to pursue the various skillshots.+The graphics are actually pretty good. Colorful, detailed environments, many of which can be used with the skillshot system, and the effects are quite well-done.+The story is actually pretty good. It's completely absurd and over the top, but not necessarily in a bad way. If you don't go in expecting a riveting story, it's actually a pretty good premise. I won't spoil any of it, but it's got a decent antagonist who you really love to hate.+The length of the single player campaign is awesome for a FPS, especially compared to other recent shooters (COD games, for example, which are offensively short for the single player campaign). The SPC should take at least 8 hours for most players, and if you try to go for the skillshots, it will take even longer. The combat doesn't get repetitive because of the skillshot system.+The sound design is excellent. Effects on shots and environmental takedowns is great, the music is very cool. The only downside of the sound is the laughable voice acting, which can get grating after a while, but it does go along with the over the top story.+The \"fun\" factor. This game is just plain fun. It's frantic, hectic, and loud. Lots of energy and a fast pace throughout. Sometimes I wished that it would slow down a little bit for some contrast, and while that happened a slight bit, it didn't seem like enough. That said, though, this is also in line with the over-the-top nature of the whole game. The skillshots are loads of fun, and I just had a blast with this one. Very well done.The bad:-The game is very linear. Definitely an \"on rails\" kind of game. And by that, I mean it's VERY linear. When linear is done really well, it's not noticeable at all (like the Uncharted games - very linear, but I never felt like I was being pushed along a particular path in those). Here the linear nature of the game didn't really bother me much, because the skillshot system kept things fresh throughout, but I was definitely aware that it was linear throughout most of the game. You are pushed along singular corridors...and pushed, and pushed. There is almost no variation in approach to different areas, enemies, etc.-The user interface is somewhat confusing and unhelpful. It lists the various skillshots, but without any seeming purpose. It doesn't tell you how to accomplish those skillshots, nor does it clearly identify which ones you've successfully achieved and which you have yet to go. Many of the skillshots are only unlocked as you progress through the game, or as you perform other skillshots, but it's not clear which ones are new. Fortunately, this didn't seem to hamper the game or the skillshot system, but it could have added something to the game that wasn't, and it seems like a missed opportunity.-Language. SO MUCH CURSING. Why is this kind of language necessary? Some of the quips were funny, once. But they repeat the same jokes and foul language, over and over and over. It does go with the over the top story, but it's just not necessary, and would have been a much better game without it.Overall:This game is loads of fun. A more open-world format, a better UI, and FAR less foul language would have made it near perfect. Here's hoping for a sequel that addresses some of these issues, but the game is definitely recommended for FPS fans.Gameplay - 8/10Plot/Story - 6/10Graphics - 7/10Sound - 6/10Length - 8/10Fun - 9/10Overall - 8.5/10 (not an average)NOTE: I didn't include anything about the coop or multiplayer aspects of the game, because I never play multiplayer at all...ever...so I couldn't care less about it, and can't speak to it. Sorry. But apparently the coop is somewhat limited but pretty cool, and the multiplayer is pretty neat in itself. Others can speak to this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001Y7404","description":"Silent Hill 4: The Room offers a new cast and story, full of dark mysteries and horrendous new creatures. Henry Townshend is trapped in a cursed apartment. Mysterious portals have appeared in them, leading him to disturbing alternate worlds. This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"This is more like it.","reviewText":"My first reaction to previews of Silent Hill 4 was that they had run out of ideas and this was going to be a lame attempt to make this instalment a bit different. Well, I think I was wrong. Silent Hill 4 has rewarded me with more fear and unease than I experienced in the second and third games, and I've really fallen for the new structure. In case anyone is not yet aware, this game takes place in an apartment, from which the main character, Henry, is unable to escape. Henry is thoroughly cut off from the outside world until the day he finds a strange hole in the wall, which leads to adventures in hideous, nightmarish locations. The main innovation here is that all action inside the apartment takes place in 1st person prespective, and although I was initially skeptical about this, it really works. After walking around in it, and returning to save in it between trips through the hole, I got to know where everything was and it really felt like MY apartment!It becomes the restful respite from the horrors of the \"other\" worlds... and it's a secure feeling that the game designers obviously wanted to instill, as later in the game - skip this bit if you haven't played yet - the apartment itself starts to get invaded by supernatural manifestations, and you can no longer roam around it in safety. This overturning of the game's only \"safe space\" really worked on me, and I longed for a way to rid it of the evil prescences that were taking it over.The adventures that take place through the hole are in the traditional SH style, 3rd person, running around looking for items and attacking weird creatures. Again, the designers have come up with some new monsters, and the two headed baby-faced creature is definitely the most memorable. The game also includes floating ghosts that can't be killed  - they also attack you, so this is pretty frustrating at times. And watch out later for some very dangerous \"Frankenstein\" creations that roam around the hospital level - very dangerous. On that note - what is it with Japanese survival horror games and hospitals? That's all four SH games, plus Siren and Resident Evil that use hospitals as a location! The other levels are more creative, and include an orphanage and a particularly weird cylindrical prison standing in the midle of the sea. There's also an apartment block which is far better than the one in SH2.Again we have multiple endings, and in this case, the conditions that have to be met to obtain them are much more satisfactory. So in all, I have no hesitations in recommending this game to Silent Hill fans, and it's a welcome relief, after the 2nd and 3rd SH games struck me as duplicating the first one too much. The character models and scenery are all superbly rendered as I expected. The graphics in SH games just continue to get better every time. Drawbacks? Well, just a few. As the game draws to a close, you have to revisit all the locations again in the same order and carry out slightly different tasks. This seemed a rather cheap way to pad out the playing time to me. Plus you can now carry only a certain amount of items, so lots of trips back to the apartment are needed to drop off unwanted items in one central storage box. And every clip of 10 bullets counts as one item! So carrying a gun means you are going to fill up all your slots with bullets. A bit mean, that one.But as a result of this, I did nearly all my fighting with melee weapons, which, it has to be said, was much more fun anyway as these weapons are all random everyday items like golf clubs and spades. Oh yes I forgot to mention the new fighting system - you can land lots of little hits on an enemy, or you can launch one very strong attack by \"charging up\" your strength and then letting rip. You'll see how it works when playing. And every weapon has it's own attack style, all superbly realised. Watching Henry fling his steel pipe all the way around and almost topple over with the effort is almost worth playing for alone.I can see reviews here that must have been written by people who haven't played the game...my advice would be to ignore them. Try it for yourself. Its definitely a frightnener. There are a lot of very painful deaths and other sickening sights on display here, so do not apply if you are squeamish. For the rest of us, though, it's a great ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"K. Geddings","summary":"Its still Final Fantasy just with a new twist!","reviewText":"I know what a lot of reviews and previews have said.  This is a stripped down final fantasy....the graphics arnt as good as the PS3 version...etc.I am here to tell you that first of all the graphics still look amazing on the 360.  If you do not have a PS3 and only have the 360 you will NOT be let down in any way by playing it on the 360.  Unless you own both systems and both copies of the game and are playing it side by side.. i do not think you will really mind.  It looks just as good as any other 360 game out there if not better.I took the time to play through the first part of the game twice (as the first time i was in bright sunlight in my room so wanted to play it at night for a better view).  Haven taken the time to examine the cut scenes and close of views of the in game model of lightning and scenery and such.  I believe it looks amazingly good.  Lightning alone looks better then any pre-made CGI Final Fantasy character in the past!While some may gripe about the linearity of the game.  I say it is a good thing.  Lets face it how many of you here have played a rpg only to not know what the heck to go ....or what to do?  You have to wander through town talking to 100 mindless NPCS till you find the right one to trigger the next event or wander a cave with 50 passages and floors just to find the correct path of the way out?  This game cuts that out but still gives you a very enjoyable experiencea big thing to keep in mind is even though it is more straight forward the game still manages to take a good 50 to 60 hours to finish!  So that means..that despite the one track path in many cases. the game still has just as much content as any other final fantasy game...just in a different way.  Meaning that ...you will still get your moneys worth out of the game!Some say this is an \"action game\" and not a \"RPG\" well the battle system is still menu based and once it opens up you still have to deal with much tactics...you still advance your charterers and gain new items and abilities over time. The story is still epic and detailed... and the scenery is still Final Fantasy.This is not some game that was redone with the \"Final Fantasy name\" tagged on (ala Final Fantasy the movie) this IS Final Fantasy just in a different light.Also to note after you finish the game there are still around 60 side missions you can take part in too! and you can return to previous areas in the end you visited so its not like its just ..one story...one path and then nothing else.The main thing that should draw you to the game is the story, the scenery and the adventure.  It may not be your old final fantasy you are used to but i think its just as good enough to stand as it's newest member. and to be honest after playing for a while i feel just as excited for it as i did with Final Fantasy 7.  While i wont say this is \"better\" then final fantasy 7 per say...i will say it if you put on the right mindset ...it can be just as fun!Give it a try!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

Very cool and very fun.  You get an assortment of weaponry which is easy to use and also fun.  You blast through waves of aliens while also exploring and wrecking stuff with your hammer and a few new gadgets to help wreck stuff.  Very satisfying!  The new thing I like is the ability to re-build stuff you've destroyed!

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

All in all it is a great magazine, it's packed with beautiful imagery which is what I mainly subscribe to it for. I've always felt once you sort of get the basics to intermediates of photoshop down, you can pretty much do anything provided you have the patience. With that being said some of the tutorials aren't really tutorials, more of the authors techniques on how he achieved a certain effect. That's great, but I do wish they had more technical tutorials as opposed to more \"subjective\". By that I mean making a pretty girl with layer blending is pretty much something you'd know how to do, but say creating rain from scratch to implement into your designs is more \"technical\". I'm not complaining too much because it is nice to see other artists tips and techniques, but it's mainly always \"play around with it to get your own personal style\".Also, the goodies on the disc are almost always borderline useless. Occasionally there are some gems from istock or .psd files they used in the design that will have some neat effects, but almost all the brushes and gradients are ones they've already had before and the rest of the stock imagery looks like it was taken from someone's backyard. At 15 bucks a pop you'd think they would put more useful things on there, like free plugins or actions, or real video tutorials that people would actually use. Heck, how about reusuable text effects or layer styles instead of the junk they chunk on there.Overall though, if the magazine didn't have the beautiful imagery on the cover and on the inside it would be a throwaway. The great artists and imagery is really what we need, giving us inspiration for other projects and artworks.I had subcribed to photoshop user and layers magazine, and the quality of work just wasn't up to par with Advanced Photoshop. But AP is a full 150 bucks a year for a subscription. I do always get my issues on time or early and they are in good condition espeically since they come from the UK. I just wish they had more useful tutorials and more comprehensive reviews of tools and plugs instead of \"press release\" based ones. If you can swing the 150 bucks it is a good investment in your creativity. Otherwise if youre just begining Photoshop you'd be better served getting Layers or Photoshop user magazine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2011"}

Harley","summary":"Multiplayer is fun but solo campaign is too bug riddled","reviewText":"I normally prefer the solo campaign over multiplayer due to the countless cheaters out there who are too lazy to take time and get proficient at games, so they hack their way to being \"good\".  However, the solo campaign in COD BO is so bug-riddled, I'm just about ready to throw in the towel on completing it.  I've had the game freeze numerous times after I'd passed several checkpoints and nearly completed levels.  It wouldn't be so bad if I could resume at a checkpoint but if the game has to be forcefully ended via task manager (as is the case for just about every freeze), you start over at the beginning of the level (or wherever you left off when you last exited the game properly)!  An \"easy\" work around is to frequently quit the game manually and restart again after the last checkpoint, but seriously, who wants to exit the game after every stinking checkpoint???  I bought the game eight months after release and this is the nonsense I'm dealing with???  And before anyone starts chirping \"Well, you shouldn't play the game on a lousy system\", not only is the system way more than sufficient to run the game, I've played through several solo campaigns of Crysis 2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 without one single crash, ever.  And that's with all the visuals maxed out on both.  If Black Ops works flawlessly for some, I'm glad for them.  Maybe certain drivers or software elements of certain systems get along better with the game, resulting in no crashes, but there is no way I'm buying that this game isn't flawed after playing countless other games that are just as demanding or even more demanding on my system.Now the multiplayer is actually pretty fun.  Not only can you play against human opponents, it also has a training mode that lets you play \"multiplayer\" against CPU opponents. Granted, as you jack up the difficulty, your team members get dumber while the enemy  gets much smarter.  On the highest levels, the CPU opponents get laughably cheap, camping nonstop (yet if you try it, an enemy will quickly sneak up on you or fire a random sniper shot from some impossible far away angle and pick you off), enemies spawn at your must vulnerable spots, enemies walk right through grenade blasts and dozens of bullets while you fall from a single shot, and while the enemy spends time flanking you constantly and working as a team, your computer teammates run around aimlessly like F-Troop. After a while, you'll start thinking the human cheaters aren't so bad.  I guess that's one way to look at it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004X56OU8","description":"","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"Two Hedgehogs, One Epic Adventure!","reviewText":"Three eras, two hedgehogs, one epic adventure! That was the slogan for what would become possibly the best Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast. This is the WhitWire review for Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 (also given a handheld version on the Nintendo 3DS).Since the blue blur's introduction to 3D-styled gameplay, opinions on the quality of his games have been mixed between the two halves of his fan-base. Modern Sonic games have been criticized over and over again for having too many scripted scenes, implementing bad cameras, causing motion sickness, and shoving unnecessary gimmicks down our throats.With the debut of Sonic Generations, the fans' attention was immediately drawn to one fact: now you could play as either \"classic\" Sonic or \"modern\" Sonic as you progress. Sonic Generations was Sega's attempt to celebrate 20 years of their beloved mascot--but does it live up to expectations?It isn't until you finish the very first level of the game as Classic Sonic when you're introduced to some story elements. The basic plot of Sonic Generations is that a mysterious time-travelling creature has captured the Sonics and their friends and sucked the \"color and life\" out of the surrounding world--all with the aim to stop time itself.Through the game's progress, you will save Sonic's friends--who have been eaten by this creature and set into alternate dimensions. Playing as Modern Sonic, you'll save your fox-friend Tails. Tails--who is just as perplexed about this strange world as Sonic is. After this, the hubworld given to you expands, you can decide whether to play as Modern Sonic or Classic Sonic, and you'll now have to zip your way through four more levels before Classic and Modern Sonic finally meet up.Upon discovering that there are two Sonics, the game's storyline goes through a very simple formula: save your friends and stop the evil that threatens to tear the world apart.As Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, it's up to you to run through this world--which comes in the form of various levels--to bring them back to life. All these levels are based on past levels from the all the Sonic games created in the past 20 years. Each of these levels are set up into groups of three--referred to as \"eras\".There are three eras: Classic, Dreamcast, and Modern. The Classic era consists of Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, and Sky Sanctuary. The Dreamcast era's levels are Speed Highway, City Escape, and Seaside Hill. Finally there's the Modern era--which is made up of Crisis City, Rooftop Run, and Planet Wisp.Both Classic and Modern Sonic will have to run through the levels in these eras. Every time the Sonics run through these levels, they travel through time and space. As a result, they restore color and life to the universe.It isn't until the end where a \"certain someone\" and his \"friend\" show up and admit to having caused all the havoc in the Sonics' world. Who are these people I speak of? I don't know, guys; I probably shouldn't spoil it for you!All this being said, the story of this game--especially for an anniversary title--is incredibly simple but manages to tie in well with the actual gameplay.If there's one thing I think many of today's Sonic games lack in, it's variety. In the past, however, games like Sonic Adventure were criticized for having too many characters to play as--half of which were completely boring in the eyes of many fans. Despite everything I've just said, Sonic Generations gives an equal balance of diversity among levels.People who played Sonic's titles on the Sega Genesis will feel immediately at home with Classic Sonic. He's everything you'd think he would be; he has the old, stout, beady-eyed look, old side-scrolling gameplay, and same means of reaching the end of levels.Classic Sonic plays identically to how he played in the Genesis days--with a few exceptions. The first difference you'll notice about Classic Sonic is the power in his spindash. In the old days, if you really wanted to make a powerful spindash, you'd have to press down on the D-pad and constantly mash the jump button. In Generations, however, you get all the power by only pressing the spindash button--and and nothing else but the spindash button--once. Once you decide Sonic is done revving up in place, you can let go of the spindash button and cause him to skyrocket across the screen--bouncing on enemies all the while.One of the major downsides to Classic Sonic--a feature that will become immediately apparent to anybody who has played the Genesis titles--is his inability to gain momentum while going down slopes. Rather than going down slopes, you'll be expected to mash the spindash button often.Modern Sonic plays exactly like he did in Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors. This being said, Modern Sonic comes equipped with the Sonic boost and the homing attack--all in a 3D environment.The Sonic boost serves as a means of speeding Sonic up. While using the boost, all enemies in your path will be killed simply by you running into them. The homing attack will serve as a means to launch Sonic at enemies and other obstacles while he's in midair. I highly recommend you use this attack if you find bouncing on your enemies in a 3D world to be tedious.A big downside to modern Sonic is his controls--which are incredibly stiff without the drifting and side-stepping introduced from Sonic Unleashed. Such stiffness makes me yearn for the controls given to him in the Sonic Adventure games.Apart from the two Sonics, Sonic Generations gives us a very close attention to detail--so close that the game is sure to make it very hard to catch all the detail all at once on your first run-through. I must admit that even I know I haven't seen all the details and alternate paths to take. The largeness of these worlds makes these possibly the largest Sonic levels since Sonic the Hedgehog 3's acts.Sonic Generations adds many minigames--all of which are based on the actual game levels--to help add to the largeness of the game. The actual replay value of these minigames can range from, \"Sure; let's give it a go,\" to, \"No! No; not this part again! Anything but that!\" In my opinion, the best levels are the ones where you race to the finish line against another Sonic. If you manage to beat all the levels in a particular area, all the color will be restored to that area based on the level it surrounds.Although Sonic is mainly known for his mind-blowing speed, there are plenty of platforming sections you'll have to go through in order to progress. I honestly think it's safe to say that this game has a perfect balance between speed and platforming.Added to this, you'll also be encouraged to search for red medallions--medals that earn you art and music. While I don't care much for the artwork, you can actually play the music pieces during actual gameplay. All these music tracks are, of course, tracks from almost every Sonic game ever made.If there's one thing in this game many die-hard Sonic fans will complain about, it's the Skill Shop. It is here where a small, blue robot named Omochao will sell you \"skills\" to use in the game. Some skills include the elemental (electric, bubble, and fire) shields for Classic Sonic and the Direct Jump for Modern Sonic. If you want to \"equip\" these skills, you have to put them into a \"skill set\".There are only 5 \"skill sets\" and you can only hold one at a time. Added to this, the amount of skills you put in your sets is limited depending on how effective the skills are to your performance. Why might people like this system, you may ask?Notorious games such as Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) and (notorious for some people) Sonic Unleashed used skill shops. Many people will argue that all of Sonic's non-game-breaking abilities should be available from the get-go--and I agree.If ever in the game you're having serious (and I mean SERIOUS) problems trying to figure out how to play the game, you have the option to activate the Omochao: who will tell you exactly how to play the game.Once activated, you can run into the Omochao anytime during the game. Omochao is slightly hard to avoid, and no matter how fast you run, Omochao will still be able to catch up and tell you every little detail concerning gameplay. For people who have never played a Sonic game before, I recommend you keep this feature on. For those who are already familiar with the series' mechanics, turning on the Omochao is sure to annoy you.Sonic Generations may have problems, but thankfully they are very few and small. Like I said before, the story of this game is incredibly simple and--I must add--slightly underwhelming. Although the story and the Skill Shop may catch people off-guard, Sonic Generations manages to bring the perfect balance between speed and platforming we've all come to know and love.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

The title alone brought first person shooters to the console and players everywhere could jump in and play. Fast forward to the year 2009 where Activision made the announcement that they were making a remake to the classic N64 shooter; some gamers rejoiced while others were a bit cautious. It caused quite a debate between those who loved the game as it was and those who were ready to see how it would turn out. The remake was released on the Nintendo Wii in 2010 and overall, it's a good remake and worth checking out for anyone who is currently into playing first person shooters and/or loved the original title.Goldeneye 007 is the remake to the N64 title made back in 1997 by Rare based on the James Bond movie of the same name. In the main single player mode, you control James Bond in several stages where you must complete certain objectives, rescue hostages and make it all the way to stop the main villain from using a satellite to destroy the world. Then there is the multiplayer mode comprised of two parts: local multiplayer where up to 4 players play against each other and online multiplayer where up to 8 players can shoot it out against each other or in teams during each match. Both modes offer different match scenarios and a sizable chunk of options including time limits, weapons, handicap settings and stages. Online multiplayer also offers players the chance to earn experience points to increase your rank, overall score and the ability to unlock different weapons, gadgets and special attributes while online achievements also reward you with experience points.Controls are a big focus here as you are able to control turn speeds (left to right, up and down), customize your buttons (or select preset configurations), music & sound volume and what kind of controller you can use (Wii Remote w/ Nunchuk, Gamecube controller and Classic/Classic Pro controllers are all supported.) If you use the Wii Remote, the customization abilities go even further. Since this is a big game to cover, I will give my pros and cons for the single player modes (local multiplayer and online multiplayer.)SINGLE PLAYER MODEThis is a remake and that means there were some changes made between the classic shooter and the modern version. First off, not all the original characters are represented here (Pierce Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig, the nerdy Russian programmer, gadget master \"Q\" and Moneypenny are gone) and with the exception of \"M\", all of the remaining characters look different. Second, parts of the story had been changed with some scenes entirely taken off. Lastly, it is set in a modern day world so it has a more current events type of feel to it.The PROS: Eurocom and Activision did a great job in bringing this game to the modern era of video games. The graphics, presentation and overall feel like you're right in the middle of the action. The sounds and music are top notch while the controls are easy to customize and learn no matter what kind of controller you use (by the way, using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk is the best way to experience this game, in my opinion.) Everything from the locations, the characters, the game mechanics and options were faithfully recreated as if you are playing the original Goldeneye. The difficulty levels from the original game are here as well as the number of objectives you have to complete: the higher the difficulty, the more objectives you must complete. Levels are long, detailed and they all have save points scattered so you can always take a break and come back to where you left off. Quick time events are mixed into the action and don't feel like it was an afterthought at all. The cut scenes are well done and never overstay its welcome unlike cut scenes from other games.The CONS: If you are a die hard fan of the original and prefer to keep the original as is, then this game isn't for you. As I said before, there were changes made here and there. It comes down to whether you can play through this remake and not complain about the changes you see. The only complaint I can say here is while the graphics are really good, I can imagine some people say it belongs on the PS3 or Xbox 360 and that's just ridiculous. In my opinion, it wouldn't be noticed if it came out on the other consoles since there are way more first person shooters available compared to what is on the Wii.LOCAL MULTIPLAYER & ONLINE MULTIPLAYERThe PROS: If you options, you got them. The original title was known for its multiplayer mode and the remake doesn't disappoint. Everything that was part of the multiplayer from the classic title made it here, complete with updated graphics, sounds, music and controller customization. Up to 4 players can shoot it out and it feels like the good old days. So if you got friends, try out the local multiplayer. As for online multiplayer, only one person is allowed on each Wii console to go online. Online multiplayer is completely different but just as fun. Connecting online is easy and when you create a profile, you can see how many achievements you earned, your rank/score, your friend list and set up different weapon profile setups (up to 5) and select them on the fly. As you rank up, you're rewarded with better weapons, useful gadgets and special attributes. All of the weapons you use have their own achievement awards and the more you use them, the more effective they become. With different matches happening under various scenarios, you won't have a problem jumping into a game session. Exchanging friend codes is useful since you can join your friends' matches whenever they are online and invite them to sessions you host.The CONS: Local multiplayer is just that which means you don't earn points and unlock achievements. Online multiplayer is NOT perfect for a few reasons. First off, expect to see hackers and/or funny activity so if you don't want to deal with that, just leave the match you are playing in and get into another one. Second, sometimes matches are interrupted if the host of the match loses his/her connection or leaves the match entirely. There will be a time when, for whatever reason, you lose your connection and return to the lobby to choose another match to get into. Thirdly, you have to adjust your controls and customize it prior to logging to the online multiplayer.

Rose","summary":"Just check the other reviews.","reviewText":"I can't say much to top what's already said in the \"Most Helpful\" reviews for this game. I'll simply agree -- The Witcher (I have this enhanced edition and can't speak to technical aspects of the original) is a GREAT game. Truly stands head and shoulders above the bland 'vanilla' RPGs plaguing the genre (Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age, etc.).Geralt is an awesome player character. He gambles, drinks, steals, curses, sleeps around, and is an all-around bad@ss. His world is well-conveived, visually stunning even by the standards of modern computer games, and much more dynamic than those of more mainstream RPGs, mingling many races and cultures fluidly (thanks in large to the fact that Andrzej Sapkowski set the stage so well for them in his Witcher novels). The plot is creative and refreshing. I rarely saw what was coming and never found myself sighing 'ho-hum' at cliched plot devices like I did with NWN2 or, most recently, Dragon Age. The Witcher's story is truly innovative.Speaking of innovation -- the combat system rocks. Magic, potions, and swordsmanship must all be employed to really excel in combat. Herbalism and alchemy play a major role, as you're forced to supplement your equipment and skills, which are limited (intentionally! it's a good thing in this game), with various potions to augment various abilities.It's strange, but gambling, stealing, and drinking play important roles in the game just like swinging your sword and clicking \"Okay, I'll accept the quest!\". These seemingly small details go a long way in adding depth to the game.Bottom line: if you like RPGs, get this game. Graphically and musically great. Storyline is solid, refreshing, unique. Main character is awesome and unique. Combat is almost revolutionary for a single-character RPG. Lots of items and secrets. Loads of fun. The Witcher sets the standard by which other RPGs will be measured in the coming years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Jshelt21","summary":"Final Fantasy 13-2","reviewText":"This game has good parts and bad parts to the gameplay and story just like every other game. While I did like 13 and the story even though it was hard to follow at times. It was a good game but just like everyone else it was too straight forward. 13-2 is much more open with vast timelines to explore but the story is easily figured out. While still good some aspects of the game annoy me. At first I enjoyed the monster part of the game collecting different types and advancing them but eventually you get tired and wish there was more characters. It is dissapointing only really having two characters, but not a game breaker. The story is good perhaps not as good as 13 was to me and the battle system is the same which I enjoyed. The mane problem I have with this game is the DLC's. These companies are getting way out of hand with this stuff, now 60 dollars isn't enough for a game now they make you pay more money for the rest of the game. It makes no sense. But anyways this is a good game fun to play and advance through the story and advance your characters but not as good as previous final fantasy games.Well I've beaten the game and my final review of the game would be a high 3 to a low 4. Yes the game is much more open with a lot of extra's in the game for when you beat the game however there were things missing from the game that was disspointing. There is no summoning in the game which I missed from the older games and only two playable characters which was very disspointing. While I played this game I did enjoy it but I wasn't as into it as I have been for previous one's so it is an improvment and a downgrade depending on how you look at it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2012"}

There is a saying in SciFi - once you introduce time travel, you've jumped the shark.  This game is not the exception.  Characters from the last game make appearances, most of which make little sense.  The storyline has huge holes in it and mostly consists of go to an area, fight random encounters, go to the same area in a different time, do the same thing, rinse and repeat.  The final chapter consists of rotating platforms that do not take skill to figure out, just sit and wait.  There is an incomplete gaming planet where you can play unwinnable slot machines (worse then Vegas) or race your chocobo.  Don't get too excited, you just sit and watch, maybe pressing boost.There are also several bugs to the game.  Archylte Steppe has several bugs that keep you from farming end game materials for example.Finally the ending.  You think that there is one, but wait, no there isn't.  Your eyes weren't deceiving you.  It's a 'To be continued'.

The sound is incredible, with great vocals and Bristish slang in between. Use of the &quot;F&quot; word is good in some spots, but sometimes it seems deliberately used. This can be annoying if you aren't much into cussing. The music is generally bad, but that's not terribly noticeable. The controls are easy as hell if you use auto-aiming. They are impossible if you are using manual. There's really no in between or stable controls to be found here. You'll love the missions, and you'll feel that there just aren't enough. However, some in Mark Hammond's scenario are near impossible to beat! Replaying them can be fun, and free roaming is fun as well.The cinematics are great! Gamespot seems to view them as unskippable. They are, at least the second time, fully skippable. Just press R3! That'll do it!Overall, Gamespot and many other resources were not fully fond of the game. Neither am I, but it is really good!

The good news is, this is much MUCH easier than the controller-grinding frustration of GTA. It also conforms to the central european gangster genre(i.e. foul language mixed among Britishisms). In that sense, it also has amazing character development and a driving plot(i.e. the main character can only take so much being bullied around before he decides to take the dominant role - oops, was that the ending?!). Anywho, the bad is that it's just slightly frustrating if you can't adapt to the game's high standard of visual puzzles(i.e. blinky=turn, blinky blinky=stop, drop, and boogie). There are some nice challenges, and you WILL beat this game if you try hard enough. Whereas in GTA, it makes you physically ill to repeat a task, in Getaway, it's actually a possibility.So hey, it's extremely linear and it's \"trying to be a movie\".

{"product_name":"B002I0IVC4","description":"","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The SSFIV port for the 3DS done......RIGHT (4.5 stars)","reviewText":"Super Street Fighter IV has been enjoyed by the PS3/360 crowd for a long while now and it was really surprising for Capcom to bring this title for the 3DS AND it would be one of the launch titles. So finally when it was released alongside the 3DS in March of 2011, it quickly became one of the few titles gamers had to pick up. Yes, this port of SSFIV was done right. Here's why:Super Street Fighter IV lets you choose from a variety of game modes: arcade, versus, 3D versus, internet match, training, figurine collection and challenge. In all of the modes, you choose from one of 35 characters each with his/her own moves. Arcade mode is the main story where you learn about each character's background, Versus and 3D versus (over the shoulder view) lets you play against another player via local wireless. Internet Match is where you go online and play against others online from around the world. Training is just that; pick a character and go through his/her own training levels where you learn how to perform all of their moves. Figurine Collection is rather unique; you get to earn player points and use them to buy figurines of every character on various levels. Not only can you collect 500 of them but you can assemble teams of 5 and send them out via the StreetPass feature to other gamers to fight against their teams. You earn points and bragging rights for each battle won like this. Finally, challenge mode lets you take each character through the bonus stages featured in the game to set high scores which are saved for future reference. The game also lets you tweak game settings via the options mode and to look at your player data to see achievements earned and how much you've played.As far as controls go, Capcom has set up Lite and Pro Controls. Lite Controls basically use the touch screen to display buttons that automatically pull off your character's traditional and special moves while you use the buttons on the 3DS to perform punches, kicks and throw/grabs. This is for those who generally do not play fighting games. Pro Controls use the touch screen to display other specific moves and are geared for the gamer who already plays fighting games and are comfortable performing traditional and special moves manually. SSFIV uses the \"3D\" filter for subtle 3D backgrounds and effects so it's up to you if you want to use it.The PROS: This port comes really, really close to how it looks and plays on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and it's a great achievement. It has all of the features from the HD consoles plus extra content just for the 3DS. Capcom set it up for just about anyone to jump in and see why so many gamers love to play it. You can customize the difficulty, controls and duration of matches, decide to play against another person standing next to you (regardless of whether the other person has a copy of the game or not.) There are achievements to unlock and playing through the various modes will keep you busy. If you're looking to play against others online, you won't have a problem as there are lots of people still playing SSFIV to this date. Plus, the figurines you can collect and assemble teams to challenge other players is an addicting feature; you can even trade figurines you have with others if you don't feel like buying them yourselves. Really, there is a lot of stuff to do in this game.The CONS: There is one flaw that kind of hampers the game a bit. You can use the circle pad or the tradition \"cross\" pad to control your character but be warned: pulling off moves with the circle pad is a little harder because you need to be more precise as opposed to using the \"cross\" pad. Also, your hands will cramp up after extended play sessions because of where the circle and \"cross\" pads are located. You will need to take breaks to let your hands rest.Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition is a game you don't expect to make an appearance on the 3DS but Capcom brought it out and showed that you can enjoy quality console titles on the go as long as you do it the right way. Even if you're not a hardcore fighting game player, you can still enjoy parts of the game and even learn how to play. I'm not into fighting games as much but I still enjoy these kinds of games and decided to buy it. I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have it yet. Don't hesitate; give this one a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Looks amazing..not enough to do.","reviewText":"LA Noire looks absolutely outstanding. The graphics are exceptional, however the game itself contains a few niggles that I wish had not been there. The look of the recreated city and the appearances of the characters you encounter means that you never grow tired of watching the screen, but you may sometimes grow tired of some of the things you have to do.The reason for this is because it's such a simple game to play. You are a detective who is sent to various crime scenes. The structure goes something like this: Search the crime scene and pick up clues until there are non left. Visit all locations until you have visited them all. Interview people at each location and see if you can spot when they are lying. End with a chase, gunfight or punch up. Next case. That's it in a nutshell. No matter if you score top marks in the interviews or miss loads of vital clues and hints, you will still always close the case. There's no game over for making bad choices, which I found odd...it would have been better to have to replay the cases if you ended in failure, but you always end up catching the bad guy, with only a high or low star rating to give you any sense of achievement.I can't fault the physics of the game play though, the walking, running and driving controls are great, gun fights are easy - a bit too easy actually - and as mentioned before, everything looks totally realistic. But it's very linear...unlike Grand Theft Auto (from the same stable), you can't free roam the city of L.A., unless you answer a few calls for help that pop up mid mission. But there is no between mission \"down-time\" at all, so all those intriguing streets and buildings that fly past as you drive are just impressive scenery...which struck me as crazy because the city is VAST, and yet there is no reason to ever stop and explore it. No mini games, side quests, achievements, nothing that happens outside of the storyline missions. Sometimes this means that even the driving gets boring - the map is so large that a drive from one location to another seems to go on forever - there's no fun in causing mayhen, as you are playing a policeman, and damage caused to people or property only reduces your final score.What also jarred a bit was the limited use of choosing vehicles. You can pick up any car you like and drive it about, but as soon as you arrive at a storyline save point, the game replaces your chosen car with the standard one again. Plus all damage to your car caused in a long reckless journey disappears at every save or new scene, so I eneded up driving like a maniac just to save time, as I never ever ended up in a wreck. (Maybe I was just a good driver!)Of course, I can't review this game without praising the cast. The highlight of the gameplay is interrogating suspects, and I loved this. All the characters are modelled on real actors and their faces are amazing. So many expressions and movements are captured, it's like watching real people. I certainly wasn't disappointed by this, and trying to work out if someone was lying or not was a constant challenge that never got boring.But sadly some other elements did. The driving from one location to another got VERY boring. No points are awarded for time challenges, stunts or meeting any conditions at all. I was hoping for some skill based set-pieces (as in GTA), like having to escape armed gangs driving only an ice-cream truck, or drive without bumping anything to avoid detonating a bomb, but there was nothing like that at all.So to sum up, this is an amazing game to look at, but what you actually have to do can become repetitive. The realism of the location and the cast will keep you fairly hooked though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2011"}

I had a great time dancing with my family, and stayed up for hours with them the night it arrived. Just Sweat mode was fairly challenging, but offered a welcome break from a traditional workout. Most of the time I used On Stage mode, which is just the normal dancing mode. I really liked that you could choose to be either a lead or back up dancer. The game also had some pretty good songs. We had fun with the music that came free with the game and didn't bother paying for any of the additional songs. It's nice to have that option.

Sure, there's still a lot to do with crime, and you steal cars, there's hand-to-hand combat, and there's drive-by shooting, but you're still on the \"good side\".  Another valid point is that this game takes place in an actual city; not a make-believe city like Grand Theft Auto.

No doubt about it, this is one of the most ambitious titles to have ever been published.  Bethesda has really set the bar to astronomical heights.  With regard to the PC version, I've not experienced any problems with installation or gameplay.  It runs at a smooth framerate and looks astonishing.  The UI is easy to learn and navigate.  Customization options are near limitless.  Story is compelling and deep with all of the optional side quests.  The VATS system adds a nice combat option if you're not an FPS nut (which I am, but I still like VATS).  This game will consume a lot of your time and effort, so prepare to expend a great deal of both in order to complete this thing.  That's probably the one thing I wasn't really prepared for (I was shocked at the size of the strategy guide).  However, I think most will achieve a great sense of satisfaction upon successfully making it through even the main quest.

Jet Set Radio Future was a victim, and so is the X-Box version of Soul Calibur 2 -- meaning simply tapping the buttons won't get you any response. Everyone I talked to doesn't notice this in either game, so maybe I'm just crazy or have gotten defective copies.As for the game itself, Soul Calibur 2 is little more than another scenario along with Soul Calibur [1] and Soul Edge. The controls remain untouched (I'm not making a stupid joke either): Block, [Normal] Attack, Vertical Strike, kick, and Power-Up. Also, jumping isn't a simple matter of pressing Up. You have to press an attack button too, and press it hard.If you aren't irritated by having to press-hard buttons like I do, the X-Box version is the best one to get. After all, it features Spawn. Although Spawn isn't the best character in the game (that honor, in my opinion, goes to either Ivy or Inferno), he's the best exclusive character. How this version compares to the others in other areas, however, is unbeknownst to me. I did do graphical comparisons between the X-Box game and a GameCube playable demo, and noticed that the GameCube version's graphics were slightly richer. Maybe it's different when you use an S-Video.I haven't touched the PS2 version yet.Bottom line: If you don't have sensitive fingers, get the X-Box version.

Why is it more now than when it first came out($59.99)?!?  Anyway, I thought about pulling the trigger, but hadn't read up much on the game and from what I had seen on the box artwork front/back, seemed kind of silly.  I didn't know whether I would really like it or not.  Boy, was I being a really poor judge for myself.  As the saying goes, never judge a book by its cover.  I read about it and it seemed to have a rather interesting plot.  When I saw a Best Buy sale for $39.99 a few weeks later, I placed an order.  I am sure glad I did.

Each game was completely transformed from the inside out with updated graphics and sound effects.  Also included is the Japanese version game, Super Mario Bros.:  The Lost Levels.  The original NES version had never been released in America -- UNTIL 1999, when it was included in Super Mario Bros. Deluxe for Game Boy Color.  It's still a rare game to find in itself, but if you do, the challenging levels are a real doozy.For veteran players, each of the 4 games feel very new and fresh.  However, my personal favorite has always been Super Mario Bros. 3.  An excellent over-world map with various levels and suits for Mario to wear, it can quickly get you hooked.  This particular game would also become the groundwork for later Mario installments such as New Super Mario Bros. 1 and 2 for the Nintendo DS/3DS.  And believe it or not, I actually bought this cartridge that also included Super Mario World for the Super NES.  So basically, it is 5 games in one instead of the usual four.

That same arrogance led me to foolishly think I could buy a new Fender and be rocking out in no time, after all, I know chords... I know song composition and I already play an instrument.Of course, the reality is that unless you're some ungodly prodigy you can't apply what you about the piano and instantly perform the same stuff on a guitar. So with my ego thoroughly put in its place I purchased Rock Band 3 and the 'real' guitar with it's hundreds of fret buttons (which is quite good I must admit as it's midi too). After many nights though, I really didn't get a feel that I was learning anything. This was borne out when I picked up my Fender and attempted to play along for real with the song. Anything I had learned seemed to rely on buttons and not the intricate and complicated chord formations that you have to do on an actual steel stringed instrument. The buttons offer no feedback, no tactile report that you have strummed the right string... so I knew I had to get Rocksmith as it would work with my REAL guitar.The biggest leap for me was the fact that a real note was coming from the guitar. With RB3 and the Mad Catz you're note really playing, you're merely plucking the note hopefully at the same time that the game is expecting... miss that timing or play the wrong note and you hear nothing. This is a missed opportunity and I would've liked to hear the note even if it was wrong or even if it was right but played at the wrong time. With RS you get that and this alone makes it worthwhile. Of course, the fact that you are actually playing a real guitar is the second biggest plus.I did originally see the lag issue brought up by other reviewers and solved it by using headphones - not ideal but I can appreciate why the lag happens. There are several solutions which others have found and the one that works for you will depend on your TV multi-media set up.So aside from that if you're on the fence between Rock Band 3 and Rocksmith - get the latter. It's real learning, playing a real guitar making real sounds. Very happy I switched.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

You can drive all sorts of cars and bikes, boats and choppers weren't as easy to come across in this game but still in existence. You can still have several safehouse and a girlfriend of course. Rockstar basically cut the fat from the steak and left all the meat in my opinion as far as variety and choices.The missions are fun, vast, and full of variety. Some are a bit over the top challenging or just plain stupid but that was only 4 or 5 missions out of around 90.The controls aren't all that clunky like most say, the only problem I had was getting in and out of boats and controlling choppers.The graphics are great just like you'd expect, maybe not as good of Gears of War 2 or Assassin's Creed 2, but otherwise better than average.The story and characters aren't going to rock your socks but it will suffice. After all, who really plays GTA for the cut scenes?Most of what I liked about this game is that you can take a taxi and practically warp to most every location in the game for just a few bucks, the only locations you are restricted access from is if the bridges are blocked, but they all will be eventually cleared as you progress through the game and you will be able to take a cab there as well. It saves a lot of time and effort driving from one side of town to the next just to die in the first few minutes of the mission. Some said this made the game unchallenging or cheap but I don't know what they're talking about. Buyng a taxi for a few bucks versus driving around for five minutes - really?Also, if you fail a mission you get a text on your cell phone that gives you the option to try it again. If you select yes you will instantly warp to the beginning of the mission. A lot less hassle in my opinion.There are a few negatives to this game. There are no gang wars unless you buy Episodes and the multiplayer isn't anyting near the level of Modern Warfare 2 or Halo 3. However, I still believe GTA IV is way better than its respectable spin-offs like Saint's Row 2 and The Godfather 2.In the end, everyone that says this game is the worst of the GTA series or is a step down from San Andreas needs to stop playing Xbox 360 and go back to Playstation 1 where you played the entire game from a hawk's point of view and your character looked like a freakin PEZ.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000R37S78","description":"More Information Coming Soon.","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"A Great SRPG for the PSP","reviewText":"Perhaps the best SRPG for the PSP, Jeanne D'arc (Joan of Arc in French - thank you commenters!) is a RPG play off of the history of Joan of Arc, and is the story of a French peasant whose village is burned by the English and decides to wage her own war against the English. Her friends join the fight, and she finds others along the way that fight with her to liberate France.Set in the time of Joan of Arc, being an RPG it is obviously infused with many fantasy elements, such as magic (spells), the ability for Jeanne to \"transform\" herself via a mysterious bracelet she finds or rather chooses her (she herein becomes France's \"Savior\"), and of course monster warriors that the English use as part of their army.STORY 8The story is not incredibly original, however, it uses the fantasy elements well to enhance it. It includes corruption on both sides - English and French, and other twists that make it engaging and never boring. The cut scenes are beautifully done - excellent graphics and sound, and are just enough that you never get the sense that there are too many.GRAPHICS 9The cut scenes graphics are beautifully animated. The rest of the game is played on the battlefield, looking at the world map, or from menus. I would have enjoyed the opportunity to enter the actual towns outside of battlefield play... instead, you can choose to \"SHOP\" which takes you to a menu where you can purchase items, weapons and spells from the town that you are occupying on the world map, which is typical for an SRPG, but I always am looking for a hybrid between RPG genres. As far as graphics go, though, the world map is also well illustrated.SOUND 9As I said, the sound in the cut scenes is excellent... the voices sound real, and outside of the cut scenes the music is never annoying, whether in battle or world map.GAMEPLAY 7I separate battle play (next) from gameplay because the battle part of the gameplay deserves a higher rating. Like I said, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to enter actual cities outside of just battlefield play instead of just a menu (again, I always ask myself why SRPGs don't hybrid that way). The other reason gameplay gets a 7 instead of an 8 or 9 is because the game is too linear. There aren't many opportunities to deviate from the storyline that has been set for you, such as random exploration or side quests. This is one of the most fun parts of an RPG for me, and one of the only big things that makes Jeanne D'arc less than perfect. You can replay past battles to level up at anytime (see below), but there are few purely optional side quests.On the positive side, you'll see that battle play gets a 10 below, and also, the element of \"Open Combat\" is great... after clearing certain levels, you can go back to those towns and engage in open battle play for the sake of leveling up your characters and aquiring gold, items, spells, and other treasure.BATTLE PLAY 10Battle takes place on a grid, classic SRPG style, and harmoniously unites turn based play with strategy. You're goal is usually either to defeat all enemies or to reach a certain point without either being wiped out, or, sometimes you have to make sure not a single ally dies. You spend turns moving and attacking, and making strategic choices with regards to the placement of your army. When you have allies on adjacent squares, it aids in your defense, however it can also work against you if you, for instance, have a large group in a row and an enemy has a spell like \"Impale\" which allows them to slice through any and all characters lined up in a row (you can get the impale spell as well).Like I said, it is an excellent melding of turn play combat with strategy based battle. Also as mentioned before, you have spells, and the main character (as well as another character met along the way early in the game) have the option of \"transforming\" into a stronger warrior based on their bracelet and what gems they hold to enhance their transformation.Open combat is another great addition, as stated before, to level up your characters and gain gold to buy new weapons, spells and equipment.OVERALL 8There are not enough great SRPGs for the PSP, and this is one of them. My only major complaints are the story/gameplay being too linear. Aside from that, Jeanne D'arc is an excellent SRPG for the reasons given above that most of you RPG'ers will enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

I don't know what became of that original copy, but I was overjoyed to find this republished here on amazon.com.  There are places in this game that stick in my memory - the dead city buried under Ragpicker's Square, Curst, and the Fortress of Regrets.  The wonderful city of Sigil that seemed to possess so many dark corners and odd inhabitants from all corners of the multiverse.  There was something vastly different about this game, something that set it apart from the wonderful BGII and other games of the day.  There is even something that sets it apart from the games of today, such as Dragon Age and Oblivion.  Granted, the graphics are aged, but still catch the eye.  They possess an art style that still makes them intriguing.  The depth of ideas, philosophy and wonderful fictional history floating within the text conversations that frequent the game is what sets it above most of the RPGs of years gone and even the ones of today.  Upon playing it again, I am enjoying it immensely, but find myself in a way rather sad.  This game was a pinnacle from back in the day, back when you spent hours delving into conversations and puzzles trying to find the next step to solve the riddle of a man, your immortal protagonist that ever struggles to find his scattered memories.  However most of what is produced today doesn't seem to come close.  I found I greatly enjoyed Fallout 3, a wonderful example of depth with improved graphics.  But discouraged with the linear fare typical with many console/PC games, such as Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and the latest FF offerings.  It would be absolutely killer if someone revisited Planescape with something akin to Fallout 3.  Alas, it will probably never happen.  If you like RPGs however, I highly recommend you snag a copy of this gem while it is still available.  One of the finest examples of the genre out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000F3AADE","description":"Dead Rising follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, a freelance photojournalist after the scoop of a lifetime. In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"Zombies!","reviewText":"To paraphrase a Marine Corps saying: \"Killing zombies is easy and fun\". At least, it is when you're playing \"Dead Rising\", the latest zombie title from Capcom.But let me clarify the above point a bit. When I say \"easy\", I'm talking about dealing with individual zombies or small groups of them. As one character tells you in the beginning, \"The good news is, zombies are slow and stupid!\" The bad news is that what the shuffling undead lack in speed and smarts, they make up for in sheer numbers. Dealing with one zombie is easy, dealing with 20 is a whole other matter.\"Dead Rising\" puts you in the shoes of Frank West, a freelance photographer who gets wind of something going down in the secluded Colorado town of Willamette. After bypassing military roadblocks by hiring a helicopter to ferry you in, you touch down at the local mall to investigate.The early stage of the game is peppered with quite a few cutscenes, but they are surprisingly engaging and set up an intriguing storyline. The character models are alarmingly realistic, right down to those wispy hairs women have on their cheeks, but there are quite a few uncanny valley moments.As Frank explores the mall, you will discover vast array of zombie-killing implements, each with their own unique effects. In just an hour or so of play last night, I used a lead pipe, a 2x4, a baseball bat, a golf club, a cleaver, a sickle, and a pistol. The sickle was particularly satisfying. After Frank buries it in a zombie's neck, he dislodges it by bracing a foot against its chest and kicking it off, which has the effect of decapitating zombie in a gush of blood. I guess that why they say sickles really satisfy.But even zombie-hacking would get old after a while, and so it's to Capcom's credit that they've designed a deeper and more engaging game. Frank's real objective is not to mow down endless numbers of zombies, but rather to uncover what the hell has gone so horribly wrong in Willamette. He does this by tracking down survivors and piecing together information from a couple of apparent government agents also trapped in the mall.Frank also has to document what is happening by taking photos. The game walks you through a tutorial that instructs you on how to compose pictures with horrific, dramatic or erotic compositions. The more of those elements you can squeeze into a photo, the more \"player points\" you earn and the faster your skills improve.There are also plenty of side missions, from checking out mysterious developments to rescuing other characters and leading them to safety.I do, however, have two complaints. One is about the camera. Instead of staying right behind Frank all the time, he can rotate in your field of view so that what he's looking at isn't necessarily what you're looking. Sure, you can reorient the camera behind him with a click of the thumbstick, but it's still annoying, especialy when you're beset by a dozen zombies coming from all sides. It also makes it hard to use aimed weapons like the pistol.The other complaint is about the save system. Basically, you have one save slot, and you can only save at your \"home base\" of the security room, or in the mall's bathrooms. Unfortunately, you can find yourself quite a ways away from those places while carrying out a mission, and if you die, you've just lost a good chunk of progress. Also, from some of the reviews, the single save slot can also be problematic because many of the missions are timed, and if you save at the wrong point, you may not have enough time to complete the mission, requiring a total restart.Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to some good old-fashioned zombie bashing, with a bit o' \"X-Files\"-style conspiracy thrown in to boot. If you're antsy for some good 360 action during the summer lull, it'd be worth your time to check out \"Dead Rising\".","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2006"}

Joy","summary":"Been with the series since '98, this is a mediocre effort","reviewText":"Pros:Full licensingLots of modes to playSkill games are fun and newCons:FULL of glitches/bugsFirst-touch addition is badOnline play is tediousEasy to lose to cheap tacticsI've been with the series since FIFA '98.  Anyone remember the indoor mode in that game?  That was awesome.  This year's showing is mediocre at best.  Since the \"pros\" listed here are basic, I won't discuss them as they should be included in every game.I've had this game lock up my system at least once per session.  I will try to play online and I get frozen in the arena.  I can move around, but it never progresses to the game.  Other times, it will just flat out freeze in the arena.  Other times yet, I will get into the arena and I will be controlling another team's player, then the game will quit once I get to the stadium.  Even further, I can go into my roster editing before the game and it will only show my default team, even though I may be playing with another squad (e.g., my default is Man Utd and if I were to play with Germany, I'd see I'd chosen Germany, but the roster would display United players).  FULL of glitches and bugs.I want to say that the first-touch mode is terrible.  I can play against the computer and they have perfect first-touches all game.  I play a pass with Xavi or Scholes to Messi or Nani (I'm using examples of good passers and excellent dribblers/ball controllers) and the ball ping-pongs around the pitch.  I can understand if I'm playing with a League 2 team and someone with a 55 rating, but when the superstars in the game can't even pass and receive the ball without issue, something's wrong.  It rewards build-up play, but it's hard to build up when it becomes a giant mess of 5-6 people clamoring for the ball.  It looks like a little kids' match.Online play?  No one seems to press forward into the game.  I'm stuck watching the introduction and anthems.  FIFA lets the celebrations go on forever.  The goalscorer can run around the pitch forever before finally going to the replay.  I just want to play the damn game, not have some little kid rub it in and make me watch the intros, celebrations, and replays.  There are some screens/animations that can't be skipped.  This is tedious and significantly detracts from gameplay.  I recognize it's the other person that needs to press X to move it forward, but some of this is on EA for allowing this to happen in each year's edition.For all the talk about realism and first-touch, the game is still prone to cheap tactics by other players.  I was Division 1 in last year's edition..  I'm hovering around Division 6/7 in this year's edition because I keep losing games on cheap tactics that seem to work despite EA's insistence they've made a \"realistic\" game.  Anytime opposition plays a through ball, I will switch players and my player will stand still, this allowing the opposition player to continue unobstructed to the goal for an easy score.  Other times he will get someone in on goal and his team will come up to provide support, where's my team?  NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.  This allows for the cheapest of cheap, crossback pass to tap-in goal.  Frustrating to dominate in possession (60/40) and have twice as many shots, then to lose on balls played over the top and cheap tap-in crossback passes.Bottom line:  If you like the series, this is still worthwhile, but there are lots of issues that make this extremely frustrating at times.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

I jumped numerous times.  I couldn't believe it kept getting me, but it did!  The key is that it doesn't inundate you with enemies like most games (which kills suspense).  You are also rarely ganged up on, which is nice (but you better be ready at ALL times).  My only complaint is that the game character is a bit sluggish (compared to Halo 3 for example), but this only adds to the realism.  How fast could a person really run around wearing a heavy-duty work suit and wielding a big tool for a weapon after all?  And speaking of tools, nearly the entire weapons arsenal is industry tool based (in a distant future of course).  I found such an approach to be an awesome (and unique) experience.  The sound track is unbelievable and really adds to the intensity and suspense.  The graphics are also excellent which of course makes a game like this even more realistic (and scary).  The storyline and voice acting are also top-notch.  If you are brave enough, turn off the lights, crank up the volume and really let yourself get immersed in the game.  If you are not creeped out in short order something is probably wrong with your amygdala.  Highly recommended.Update:I am increasing this game to just under 'Masterpiece' status.

Being tricked into eating a Vacuum Mushroom Bowser sucks in everybody in Peach's Castle and now Mario, Luigi, and Chippy must find a way out of his body. Yeah pretty crazy right? Well it works and it's a warm welcome.You switch back and forth between the Bros and Bowser. On the top screen you control Bowser, and while controlling Bowser you get to use various attacks to help progress through levels in the old Mario fashion. Bowser must find his minions trapped in cages by Fawful to learn new special moves during battle, but the Bros must unlock new moves outside of battle for Bowser in his body (more on that later). Bowser can do moves such as a punch, breathe fire, do a shell slam, and even roll around as a spiked ball. All these moves must be used to progress through levels.Battles are played in RPG fashion, but a bit differently. You can punch, breathe fire, use items, use your vacuum move (to suck in certain enemies so the Bros can fight them inside Bowser's body during battle) and use special moves. Special moves for Bowser are down using the stylus and besides a few mini-games with the Bros the stylus is only used for this. Battles are pretty challenging, but never so tough you can never beat them. You can avoid damage by using counter moves or evasive moves by either punching or ducking. Each enemy is completely different and has their own unique attacks. Learning how to dodge them or counter attack is vital to winning battles (especially boss fights) since some battles can only be won this way.There are a few battles where Bowser will turn into a giant and fight huge enemies. You hold the DS horizontally to do this and it's all fought with the stylus. Each giant boss battle is epic and very fun to play, but counter attacking and evading is vital to winning. If you can't get your timing down you will lose guaranteed. While battles aren't random there are a lot of visible enemies in the areas and you have to level up or you will never beat the bosses. Once you do level up you can choose one stat to add extra points to. A wheel of numbers spins and you have to hit A to pick the number and it will be added to that stat. There are a ton of different items you can use and buying plenty of these is crucial to staying alive during battles.Of course you can also buy gear to equip the Bros and Bowser with. Some add to stats and some help reduce damage, or even SP spent for special attacks. There are plenty of items to buy, but make sure you always have the best stuff at all times.Of course playing as the Bros is a little different. You control the Bros at the same time so you can jump, spin, hammer, and drill your way through levels. Each of these have to be acquired over time as well to progress through levels. You are inside Bowser through 90% of the game trying to find a way out and help Bowser acquire his abilities to save the Mushroom Kingdom. The Bros work the same way in battle as Bowser except special moves aren't done with the stylus and you have to acquire them by finding 10 Attack Pieces in each level. These are easy to find since they are always marked on your map so this is very helpful. The Bros also get mini-games that use the stylus and buttons and they very, but there are plenty so you won't get bored.While this is a Nintendo brand game its not perfect and does have it's flaws. It can be drawn out pretty long and will take you a minimum of 20 hours to beat. The game does get repetitive since towards the end of the game you just want to get to final boss and the battles get annoying and dull. There are some level design flaws that make figuring out what to do next tough and you are left clueless on what to do some times. While the story is different with Bowser helping the Bros and vise versa it's essentially the same Mario game we've played over and over again.

Fight in tanks, jeeps, motorcycles, even a bomber.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"YAY!  LET'S KILL NAZIS! . . . AGAIN!","reviewText":"First of all, I want to say that I was not that impressed by the original Call of Duty. Sure, the gameplay and interface was solid, the Russian campaign was a nice escape from the norm, but overall, Call of Duty just didn't do anything revolutionary in the FPS genre. Just about everything in COD was done before by games like Medal of Honor and Battlefield 1942. Admittedly, COD did some of those things better.As for this new expansion pack, it really is not that good. For one, the original COD could be beaten in about 10 hours. Not a very long game, by any current standards. And it's safe to say that expansion packs often (if not always) offer less gameplay time. So how did they remedy this? Easy. They cranked up the difficulty by having scripted bombs kill you if you stand in the wrong place for too long, or the wrong place at the wrong time. And worst of all, I literally saw Nazis SPAWN in front of me due some invisible spawn point. I kill one wave of Nazis and then \"Poof!\" Hitler magically warped some Nazi stormtroopers onto the battlefield, or something. Shortly after this feeble attempt to defend the chateau, I died.I also want to point out that the COD games are trying to emphasis the fact that \"You are part of a Team\", like when you follow SGT Moody around. But the AI for my teammates is INSANE! My fellow soldiers walk right by Nazis and don't even realize what they've done! As a result, \"I\", me, personally, have to kill these Nazis that they've conveniently overlooked. Very very rarely has a fellow soldier taken out a Nazi troop for me when I'm reloading.I tried to be patient with this game, but in the end I just couldn't deal with it. Maybe I could put up with the game, if it had some redeeming replay value (I didn't buy it for multiplayer, only singleplayer). But this game has little or none. You won't find secret areas, you won't find secret maps, you won't find secret weapons, and, let's face it, any of those elements would be a little out of place in a trying-to-be-historical WWII game anyway. This isn't Doom or Half-Life.It's much worse.If you like linear games, then you'll love this.If you like more freedom, you'll probably hate it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Return of the Gabbits.","reviewText":"MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the first game in the Oddysee franchise that I have played.  The first two games in the series were released on Playstation formats, but MUNCH'S ODDYSEE came out on X-Box and was one of the launch games of that system.  I first played this game at a friend's house not long after it came out.  I was fascinated by the amazing graphics and having different characters in the world literally follow the main characters around.  It wasn't until recently, however, that I was able to get the game myself and play it all the way through.MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the third game in the Oddworld series.  If you're like me and have never played any of the other games in the series, that's okay because there's a movie at the beginning of the game that explains Abe's adventures in the first two games and the connection between Abe's race, the Mudokon's, and Gabe's race, the Gabbits.  Munch is the last living Gabbit, but is captured by the evil Vykkers, a race of creatures bent on domination, consumerism, industrialism, and environmental destruction.  Munch is taken captive and one of the early levels of MUNCH'S ODDYSEE involves helping Munch escape from the Vykker's labs' ship.  Once Abe and Munch meet up, the general storyline of the game involves getting back to the Vykker's Labs ship to rescue the egg crates full of Mudokon young and save the last can of Gabbit eggs in existence.The graphics in the game are amazing.  It feels and looks like you are playing a movie.  This shouldn't come as a surprise because the Oddworld series was originally conceived as a set of films.  However, the company, Oddworld Inhabitants, started making video games instead.  Oddworld Inhabitants has gone back to their original plans and the first Oddworld movie is apparently in production.As for game play, MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is simple enough that even most beginning gamers can play along fairly easily, yet the game has enough challenges to make it interesting enough for life-long gamers.  The game is fun to play and appeals to children and young adults, but has enough humor and oddity to appeal that it appeals to older gamers, too.  Now that I've experienced Oddworld, I'm looking forward to the cinematic tales Oddworld Inhabitants will bring.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2007"}

In this game, you'll plow your way through hundreds upon thousands of enemy thugs in this movie meets video game hybrid. Imagine Scarface if directed by 90's era John Woo. In addition to the wonderful voice acting and narration, this game has an impressive musical soundtrack that should not go unnoticed. While most gamers will come for the action or storytelling, take the time to listen to the music, I really liked the way the drums and synthesizer were used to match every scene in the game. I suppose this makes sense since Max Payne 3 feels every as much like a movie as a video game. Also, the gun fights in the game are absolutely hilarious, this is on international incident scale here, as Max Payne will take out several small armies on his march through the game, and the cops apparently don't hear any of this.If you enjoy duck and cover style action games, be sure to check this one out.Overall, I thought Max Payne 3 is a nice story-driven game with good action and good music.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

I loved the PS3 exclusives like UnCharted, KillZone, Resistance, but also loved cross-platform games like COD series, Battlefield, and especially Mass Effect 2 and 3. I love the strong stories of Mass Effect balanced with battle actions, and this is where it leads me to try Halo 4.I like the environment in Halo 4 very much - space and fantasy worlds. The details are on par with the very best. In the space ship, details including steams / smoke, electrical sparks are all very realistic. For the nature scenes, many of the tree, rock, and plant details are well articulated. Animation / frame rate is very smooth. I experienced no lag. The details on the faces of humans are among the best there is.  I do, however, feel many of the ship and platform structures and corridors are very similar. This leads me to believe it's the capacity limitation of the DVD.The sound effect is clear and detailed, and the music score in some scenes are very well done. I frequently slow down to hear the music while enjoy the view!I played the entire campaign mode to the end. Without playing Halo 1 to 3, I obviously don't have as much of the same sentimental attachment to the characters or their dialogs as those who played the series.  (But I do plan to go back and play the early titles!) Also I just finished the Mass Effect series, and are used to being non-linear. None of these justify knocking any stars off.  But the one area that didn't get the sentimental feeling that I got from Mass Effect, is the realistic feelings in the voices that matched the characters. Master Chief is more robotic which I understand. But for Katana, at the beginning her facial expression articulates a great deal (include frowning), but the vocal did not match the facial expressions. Again, my bar was raised after playing Mass Effect 2 and 3, which both female characters (e.g., Miranda) had great matching of facial expressions and feelings in the voice.All in all, I like this kind of FPS game, shooting but more in fantasy/sci-fi rather than brutal battle as in COD. Its style fits me so I think that's what matters and it was worth paying the full price. And it's enough for me to go back to the beginning.I have not tried multi-player mode yet.*SIDE NOTE* While I enjoyed viewing it on a 125\" HD projection screen and 50\" LED HDTV, the best experience I had playing this is actually onGAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

I was blown away how good this game is: the side missions were fun-- not repetitive; the story is bad ass because it reminds an old movie from the 90's Tombstone. Furthermore, the multiplayer is awsome, if you want to be a cowboy, you can ride horses in a free roam world, use turn of the century guns, and if you get the dlc (downloadable content) you can play poker/liars dice, fight zombies, and much more.Having said that, this is a real man's game, it's not for kids which I'm glad Rockstar (game developer) didn't scaled down anything to make this a teen rating.

I picked it up not even knowing if I'd like it.  I played Oblivion 5 years late so everything the game was good for was outdated/bad now. The dungeons were awful copypasta, generic setting, story, and you didn't even get to save the world.  Someone else did and he doesn't even live.  It was lame.  The combat was terrible, swords might as well have been inflatable baseball bats or some other nerf toy.  I quickly traded that in for BF3 and it was a great choice for me.Anywho I took a big risk buying Skyrim.  I kept my eyes on this gem right here from the start.  I loved Fallout 3 but the game was extremely buggy and have lost my saves on Fallout 3 about 6 times.  Never picked up New vegas but wanted to.That brings us to Skyrim.  I walked into gamestop, picked it up and it was the last copy.  Usually that's a good sign that you will enjoy the game.  I turned the game on and then I played it all night getting immersed in this rich breathing unique world that Cyrodil failed to do in comparison.  The graphics are some of the best right next to Cryengine 2/3, Frostbite 2 and Gears of war 3 in terms of graphics.  The scopes and vistas are breathtaking and awe inspiring, the combat has alot more oomph to it than previous bethesda games and you can \"feel\" the blows.  The game looks great in HD and sounds great with 7.1 and 7.1 just pulls you in.The music is some of the best I've ever heard in any single player game besides mass effect.  The fights against dragons are epic but on normal difficulty they're fairly easy compared to wooly mammoths, Giants, and maybe centurions.  They're tough but still killable.  The magic is fun to use.  I've never had so much fun \"shouting\" at chickens, shooting lightning and fire at rabbits and accidently killing allies with dragon shouts.Awesome game, some of the best escapist entertainment in the world.  In the game I'm a warrior that can use destruction magic.  When you play this game it really does make you feel like a hero.Don't question it.  Just buy this game.UPDATE IF YOU BUY THIS BEFORE 12/08/11 DO NOT GET THE UPDATE OFF XBOX LIVE 1.2 IS BUGGED EXTREMELY BAD.  PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE TO AVOID A BUGGY PATCHUpdate 12/15/2011I've ventured 80 hours into Skyrim clearing out about 80 dungeons, got my Daedric Armor, Ebony Bows, level 100 in smithing and Archery and can confidently say it's not getting old.  There seems to be always something new or different you haven't seen yet.  For example you'll be doing a quest and you'll see a fight between a dragon and mammoth and want to glory hound it, or you'll see the northern lights and be mesmerized by it's beauty too much to want to do anything.You see this game is just so rich and unique compared to your common fantasy.  The problem with most fantasy games like wow, guild wars and fable is they all look the same, generic medieval magical forest type of lore.  Now I hate to sound like the COD fanboy of RPGs but Skyrim will be considered the gold standered of RPGs till Fallout 4 which I anticipate.This isn't a game, it's a gift to every person who doesn't have anything going on in life, No girlfriend?  Not enough hours at work?  Unemployed?  Bad Social skills?  Just play this.  It'll keep you busy.What's cool about this game is all your experiences will be 90% different than the other 10-20 million people playing this.  My first night playing Skyrim I remember boldly picking a fight with a giant.  To keep it short I got to touch the big moon \"masser\".It's hard to review this game in detail but I can say if you want to enter a living breathing world and become a hero in it buy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"One of my Favorite Games this Generation!","reviewText":"I am impressed with Demon's Souls. It has be always wanting to come back to more even when I have many other new games. It does many creative things but the biggest thing about it is its the scope in size of the game. It is a brutal game so if you don't have patience than it might not be for you but you will feel really rewarded and excited to beat certain bosses and you won't feel frustrated like you been cheated in death. Enemies will kill you because you either are not strong enough yet for the encounter or you made a mental error.The game's premise is a dark world run by demons and  your the savior. What you have to do is go through kill demon's and collect their souls that can be used as currency or traded in for new armor, level up your weapons, spells, and such. The ablities your able to mix and match your pretty difference considering you can manipulate a with what you can do with your character. Before you even start your given the option to start as a mage, barbarian, wandered, knight, and so on. Each one has their own strenghts and weaknesses. When you level them up, you pick between what strengths you want to enhance your character from the ability from things such as strength, faith, luck, and such.The enemies you encounter in the world have amazing designs and great animation. The places you travel through by a hub called the nexus is like a save zone outside of the demon's ability to touch you. From my understanding its between the death and the living. When you die you will go there but you can start again and retain all the items you lost except the souls which is very important to level up. Its like experience points you can lose while in battle. Anyway, the nexus is where you find other people that allow you to store items, learn new magic, buy items, and such. Keep in my mind when you die, you will become a soul and will have to beat a boss or come across a stone piece that allows you to get resurrected.The creative aspects of the game allows a single player experience with members able to join in your gave via your request that they want to enter to help you out. You and some random player will go around take out enemies and they will often join to help beat a boss which will allow them to live again. On another note you can get invaded by a player which is someone who is a phantom trying to kill you to gain some of your souls and gather some items of yours in your world. To do anything of this, you need a certain stone piece.That is not all. When you see a blood stain on the ground, you can pick it and see the animation how someone (real player) actually died which could hint you as to what's to come. More so on that, you can actually lay hints and see hits that are placed on the ground to warn you of traps, arrows, a ledge, or anything. Its a preset list but pretty vast in what message you can lay for others to read.That is all. I will say. I said a lot as it is. The game is extremely good. It is deep in tons of weapons. It has the depth of Fallout 3 in what you can enhance via yourself, weapons, and the many items throughout the game. Its a big title. Its hard at first but gets easier if you grind. This is one of the best games I played all year and this generation. It is a unique game that deserves a chance. It is one of my contenders of game of the year. It has no flaws.Great gameplay, vast world, great music, great, great atmosphere, lots of depth, and such. It is a must play. There is nothing like it out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

This title is third in my book only behind Uncharted and MGS4 for the best exclusive title on the PS3 to date.You've most likelly read all about this game by now and know what to expect. As a gamer of 20+ years, having played almost every rpg ever made, this one stands alone as probably the most unique title I've played.First off, it is as difficult as everyone says, but let me say not to the point where you will never play it again after having died 65 times to the same group of enemies. I hate overly difficult gaming experiences like Devil May Cry 3 or Ninja Gaiden(at some points). They are frustrating, annoying, and just aren't fun after you've died more than a handful of times. THIS GAME, however, basically rewards death. You need to die. That's the bottom line. Why you ask? Because you will have gained the precious knowledge of your enemies weakness, his attack pattern, and what you need to do to own his demonic arse this time around. You do lose all of the souls you've acquired, but only if you outright turn the game off. If you go back into the same zone, you simply need to find the bloodstain where you died, touch it, and you've got all your precious souls back. Not only that, but you'll have gained more souls defeating all the respawned enemies and probably have gotten some nice, fresh item drops along the way. See what I mean about dying? It rewards those who understand it is necassary.The classes in the game really just boil down to starting equipment. Once you've beaten the first zone/boss and started to level your character a bit, you have the choice to make any class anything you want. There are some classes that have it much worse in the first zone though, like the Mage or Royalty. You'll be better off for it though now understanding how hard the game can really be.Weapons, armor, items, and your Soul Levels(how you upgrade your stats) are all purchased using souls you reap from kills in-game, so often you'll have the very hard choice to make on which to upgrade this time around. You can always just do multiple runs of certain levels and harvest more if you want, which is also made that much better by the fact that the levels are nothing short of titanic. Every single zone in the game has tons of areas closed off to you at any given point, whether it's because it's a shortcut to be revealed later, or a section closed off by tendancy(the world changes based on whether things in the zone are happy or sad basically ;p), or an area that is actually revealed in a later zone within that zones. They are setup in a sort of chapter format such as zone 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and so on. You beat the boss and unlock the next section, but also the previous closed off sections of the entry zone. It's a great idea and adds so much to the replayability tally.I'm only on my first playthru myself and I'm getting highly addicted to the gameplay. It is endlessly enjoyable to farm equipment, souls, and search every nook and cranny of all the gorgeously designed levels.The graphics and sound more than do their job on every account. The sound is, of course, bleak but fitting. There are gentle strings and aching melodies that pull at you while you search dark corners for the inevitable enemy waiting to ambush you. There are creaks, drops of water, and moans of the nearby undead waiting to jump on you like a pack of wildabeasts. There is so much atmosphere that it is often frightening, but so much the better. You must tread carefully lest you die an unseen death from the shadows and I find it to enrich an already brilliant design.The bosses...are...scary. They are massive, often the entire size of a throneroom, and they are not always slow because of this. You will need to find their weakpoint and by this I don't mean hitting them after attack A, running away, and hitting them during attack A again. I mean you will need to dodge, then parry, then counter, run away, get behind them, hit their ankle...yeah, it's involved. Once you finally beat them, however, you're left with this incredible sense of satisfaction and a whole heap of souls to upgrade yourself and own the next zone at your whim, hopefully.Combat is intense. Always. You need to learn how best to act in any given situation. Some enemies cannot and will not be hit unless you riposte(counter) their attack. Others can only be hit from behind. Others still cannot be damaged physically. There are so many varied ways to kill things, though, that it's never really overwhelming. You even have the option to utilize level traps against them. Within just the first level you can release a bunch of boulders on a group of enemies and watch them become soulless pancakes before your very eyes. It's fun to say the least.This is a game you need to learn how to play. You need to study it and its combat and you need to master it or you won't go far. But take it from one gamer who despises overly difficult games that are more about learning wrote patterns than they are becoming genuinelly skilled at something; this game is worth every single ounce of effort you put in and you will get rewarded for your hard work, more than any game I know. From what I hear, the real game doesn't even start until your Newgame+ when a heck of a lot more is unlocked within this games already brimming walls. I'm looking forward to that very much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Yes its a clone, so what?","reviewText":"Once upon a time, God of War was made, and it was good. Much was the slaying and rejoicing in the slaying, and many saw that it was good. Then more games were made in the vein of the God of War, and they were not good. Many thought the majesty of the God of War was lost. Then came a time, following much depression, when the God of War returned to us, lead by a poem of Dante, and a tale of Revelation, and again, it was good.Darksiders takes a healthy set of liberties from the Talmud and the Book of Revelations, casting the PC as War, the rider of the Red Horse, called before his time, and accidentally setting off the Apocalypse. Returning to the Council, he is stripped of his powers by forces unknown, and returned to Earth to find who circumvented the seven seals.Graphics in this are a surprising let down. Nothing is bad, to be sure, but so much of the levels repeat, and I'd expected realms more tailored to the new masters after 100 years of demon rule. The angels and demons are nicely countered: angels clad in techo looking armor and steampunked, demon organic and visceral. High tanking Demons and angels are a bit hit and miss, though are well done for their roles.Audio and voices are well done, and well cast. Samael the demon, a crucial character, is exceptionally well voiced, and will make your skin crawl. War, though ahving precious little lines, manages to convey much of his personality in the few words he says.Gameplay is essentially God of War, swapping between weapons and equipment as you scythe through hordes of demons and angels. Chests contain power ups, incremental power ups, and a variety of equipment that's very familiar. Weapons are almost all useful, though some are cripplingly underpowered. The only real crushing blow is the sand box element, which does not work for a story of this type: there's no real reason to revisit most prior stages, but you basically have to to collect health and magic power ups and other trinkets that you did not have the tools to reach initially, despite sometimes being in plain view, which is a frustrating annoyance to players.Many people complain that the majority of the games elements are cobbled together from other games: God of War, Zelda, and a level that reminded me of Orca. Its pretty much impossible to miss at certain ventures, but the game designers made a smart play, taking things they knew people liked and were used to and porting them. Not wasting effort reinventing the wheel isn't plagiarism, its using good ideas to help tell your story. And a good story, though a little light on involvement and cutscenes out of the gate, will carry through. A rare buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2010"}

So there is no point in me writing about it again because you know so here's a review about the game itselfFIFA 14 on the PlayStation 3, was already a fantastic game of footie, and without question, one of the best entries in the franchise to date.So when it arrived on the PlayStation 4, it was tough to imagine what else could be done to the game to improve it even more.  And for the most part, the game doesn't get any major improvements, but the visual polish and enhanced physics do stand out, giving the next-gen version of FIFA 14 some extra points.All the modes that you find on the PS3 are still there, such as the Ultimate Team, career mode, matches from the current week and of course the online modes. For those who had previously picked up a current-gen version of the game, you can pass your season over to the PS4.As expected, the biggest differences from the current-gen and next-gen versions are the graphics.  Players, stadiums and the pitch look extremely sharp and detailed, not to mention more colorful and realistic. Even more minor improvements like how the jerseys and shorts ripple during play, look pretty cool, so without question, this is more of a visual feast.  I also mentioned physics, which is another improvement in the game.  EA built FIFA 14 on next-gen from the ground up with a new engine and you notice it quite a bit with the way the ball moves around the field.  By that I mean that the ball seems to have more randomness to it, so that when you're passing it around, be it as a lob or a through-ball, it appears more independent than I'm used to seeing it.  In relation to that, you'll notice player animations to be less canned and more realistic than ever before, as it's clear that the amount of animations is a lot deeper than in previous games, and players react more naturally not only to the ball, but to other players, regardless if they are on the opposite team or on your own.A.I. also seems more authentic than in the current-gen versions as players on the other team appear to be more aware of what you're doing and react accordingly, so that using the same exact defensive strategy doesn't always work, forcing you to be more tactical and precise with how you play.At the end of the day FIFA 14 on the PS4 and Xbox One doesn't make huge improvements to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, but they're certainly more appealing to look at and provide a bit more realism to player and ball movement.  It's a nice effort for a game that didn't need a ton of changes, and if this is how good the game can be in an first-year effort on the new consoles, then I can't wait to see what EA can do with another full year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2013"}

I may have had some issues with Dragon Age 2 but I have gotten over them and have actually come to like it a bit more than origins, but I was tired of replaying the game and romancing Fenris over and over again so I needed something else to play lol. I saw Dragon's Dogma and decided to pick it up after reading the many good reviews here.What I liked about the game:Game play is great. It's fast paced and I love the epic boss fights. The grab system is awesome, so much so that I hope BioWare take a look at what Capcom did and use it for the next dragon age game. I got a real sense of teamwork out of the pawns, watching my pawn hold an enemy down while I slice it up was awesome. Being able to climb on top of a huge beast and hack at it was amazing! The Pawn system was also well done. I like sharing pawns and getting rewards for it. The open world is huge with lots of NPCs to talk to. Some of the clothes and armor is well designed.Update Note: While the pawns do work well together with the grab system, I sort of wish Capcom has set up some sort of tactics settings. Those rare moments when the pawns are targeting the same enemy as me were wonderful! too bad they tend to spread out charging at any enemy nearby instead of working as a solid force.Now what I hated about the game:Too much slow mo in the Gameplay. I felt like I was in episode of Spartacus. The first few times were awesome but after having to fight the wave after wave of enemies it wore very thin. The pawns are annoying and uninteresting, all they do is prattle on about a lot of nothing. Sometimes they give useful tips which is why I don't mute it but the majority of it is just yammering on about a lot of nothing. They need to take a cue from BioWare and give us interesting banter.Update Note: You can turn off the slow mo cinematic in the combat which is awesome!The open world is huge yet their travel system sucks! This is perhaps my biggest issue with this game, no horses, donkeys or wagons that can take me from one place to another. I can understand areas that aren't revealed but having to keep traveling all over the map on foot with an effect on stamina feels like a chore and makes simple quests take longer than they should, which is why I started to just skip some of them. Having to fight re-spawned monsters, bandits, and wolves while trying to travel makes me very unhappy and sometimes they all cluster together which means you could end up fighting all of them at the same time! I once had a huge Griffon(boss), some bandits, wolves, and harpies all after me and watching my character slow down to huff and draining my inventory using stamina pots trying to run away well...It's not fun and is just more work and all of this while trying to get to the location of a quest. Having to fight random boss fights in the middle of all of this ticks me off. Sure the boss fights are epic but they become a pain when done randomly.Update Note: I just want to add that the game does offer Ferrystones that automatically take you to Gran Soren (main city in the game) and they can take you anywhere on the map provided that you've placed down a port crystal. This cuts travel time down a lot. Only one major problem. You don't even get a port crystal until halfway in the game and you have to run all the way to the location you want to put it at,they seem to be rare, and you can't have them duplicated by the forgery guy in Gran Goren (or you can but it doesn't even work.Inventory system is a pain, just let me share one inventory with my group and be done with it. The save file system sucks too. An RPG that doesn't allow me to have multiple save files?? wth?! Today I actually stopped playing because I saved my game before doing something, it didn't turn out like I thought and decided to go back to where I last saved. Turned out it sent me back several hours in my game play. which meant that I had to do all the traveling I did all over again, finish the same quest all over again, and place the portcrystal where I wanted it all over again. No way am I doing that. It just seems like work and not a game I am having fun with. I do believe that if capcom fixes some of these issues they will have a great game.Update Note: word of advice. Before doing any quest in this game just pay the 50 to 500 gold to rest at an Inn because that is the checkpoint the game will send you back to if you wish to reload from the last save.Storyline:What story? All the quests are stupid and boring, the main quest line isn't separated from the side quests, the romance is so half assed it might as well had not been done. I created a female character and I have been trying to romance Barnaby(a male pawn guild leader), then suddenly my character is acting like she's in love with the duke's wife(after only knowing her for a few seconds), who, for some reason is suddenly in love with her as well. This came totally out of left field. I have no issue with lesbian romances but I have been trying to romance Barnaby. Mind you the romances mean nothing, so don't expect Dragon Age here. You basically do an escort quest, give them some gifts they like and hear a chime to let you know they like you or something.Spoiler:Then I hear they get taken by the dragon. However, the romance system is so dumb to the point where the love interest can be any last npc who just so happens to have a high affinity score with you. I've even seen a post by one player claiming that his Arisen had a child as his love interest because of this and I believe had sex with it(as I think sex with the love interest is implied post game?? Not sure), which freaked him out.Anyway, as much as I don't like it, there are things I do like about it. I really like my pawn and wanted to romance him, there is a good potential for a story here in how the pawns are treated by the humans they are trying to save, you get your heart ripped out so are you dead, alive, are your emotions gone like a pawn?? Sadly I don't think any of this will be touched upon. Perhaps when the expansion come out I'll get it when the price drops as I hear traveling is easier but right now I will put it aside and find a new game. I just can't justify spending $40.00 bucks on an expansion just for unlimited ferry stones.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

So, you're an average guy just living your average life in your average town ...Suddenly a dragon attack which leaves you, sort of...heartless. You then spend the rest of the game powering up in various missions in various towns within a medieval-Lord of the Rings looking world.all building up to the final showdown with that said pesky dragon. Simple as that.The game employs a pawn system. You design your main character, and your pawn (buddy) who has their own unique attributes. Your pawn is attached the the Playstation Network. You will also require a third pawn requiring you to connect and interact with various other pawns that were designed by the other players. If you require one that has a level significantly higher than your own party, it will require in game money that you obtain from having your own pawn pimped out to other players across the PSN. While they are off on other missions with other players, they may learn about areas and monsters and can offer you useful advise. Neat huh? The downside is, that this said advise is repeated over and over and over and over....I had a lot fun with this game. It was a moderate challenge up until about level 13 or so. I then had to put it down for a couple of months due to real life getting in the way.....but due to my pawn being rented out so much, when I returned I was filthy stinking rich with in-game money, so I wasted it all on a level 72 strider named Kurgan McAsskicker who turned the &#34;challenge&#34; into a nice interactive adventure.........no, seriously, that guy kicked the crap out of everything in his path o.O","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2014"}

And for the most part it did.Initially, the game spends quite a bit of time preparing you for melee fighting a la Batman Arkham Asylum/City. It's true that later in the game guns do come into play, but hand-to-hand combat is the main focus and once you've upgraded your skills you can really kick some butt in a variety of satisfying and quite violent ways. Want to stick someone's head in a table saw or pop them into an ice grinder? How about hanging them on a huge meathook? Sleeping Dogs is your man! There's also a parkour element but it doesn't really reach its full potential and feels tacked on and not particularly necessary except in very rare foot chase missions. Later on there's a nice matrix bullet-time feature added in but by the time you get that option you'll probably be almost done sadly.Sandbox-wise there's no flying at all in SD which is a huge shame and there's also limited vehicles. Don't get me wrong, there are an abundance of cars, bikes and boats but very little in the way of tanks, RC cars and fun stuff like that. SD is more grounded in reality though and so I'm willing to give it a pass. I do wish the area of Hong Kong was more accessible though; there's many chain link fences and unclimbable walls which really inhibit your ability to explore your surroundings. Sometimes you literally have to take a mile long detour because there's a fence cordoning off an entire area and only one entrance. It's not a deal breaker but can get annoying to find yourself on foot unable to climb a wall shorter than ones you normally leap over just because the designers won't allow it (and stuck some barbed wire on it for show).My final gripe and again, this is just for the sake of honesty, are the multiple missions where you cannot and will not catch a perp despite having to run after or chase them in a vehicle. It doesn't matter how well you drive, how well you romp over walls and bushes, the game is waiting for you and your prey to hit a specific target area for a cut scene and then usually a showdown or two. It kind of makes a mockery of the proceedings once you realize that almost every chase mission is like this. Just once let me be rewarded for taking corners and driving better than my enemy.Graphically it's quite nice and bright - very blade-runner neon as one would expect for the locale. The weather effects, especially the rain look good, but this is no next gen-looking title frankly -don't expect to be wowed by the visuals too much. Indeed the physics of the driving leave a little to be desired too, although the arcade nature of the handling makes for easier missions. So both serve well but are nothing to write home about. Audio is fantastic, especially the atmospheric ambient fx and  the acting in the real-time rendered cut scenes. No complaints there at all.Now I'm usually fond of extensive exploration versus game completion when playing sandbox games and I will hold back on main storyline missions until I feel I've upgraded my character through submissions and excursions. But with SD you're much better off finishing some storyline missions first for the most part, then tackling the sideline quests and 'favors', as you're rewarded much more by doing so. This was a refreshing change and one that totally drew me into the story much more so than any other sandbox game, including RDR, has done. By the time I finished it I was cheering out loud and then looking forward to doing some of the races and gang fights that I'd held back on earlier because my character was so weak. The bulk of the missions are extremely varied and nothing is insurmountable. By the end you know what to do, what needs to be done and will have the tools and motivation to do it. Awesome.All in all I put 35+ hours into Sleeping Dogs and enjoyed each hour more progressively than the last. I didn't get 1,000 gamerscore points but I came close. And that's about the best recommendation I can give.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Cavs Fan","summary":"Very Good Open World Game- Give it a Shot!","reviewText":"I'd give Watch Dogs a 4 out of 5 or maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10 as an adult gamer. I wanted to wait until I had played it through to give it a review. My first impressions were not great- and more like some of the negative comments that have been given regarding the similarity to other games. But as I've played all of the main missions and a good bit of the side missions, exclusive missions, collecting items, etc., the game has gotten more and more fun. I found this similar to Far Cry 3 & Assassin's Creed 4. I think that it's the mark of a great game when it gets better as you go.Yes, the game looks a lot like GTA. There are missions, car chases, etc. that look pretty GTA. There's also some of the slickness of Sleeping Dogs, along with some of its elements such as gang fights, camera hacking, etc. Then there are also parts of Deus Ex Human Revolution with network hacking. So if Ubisoft was trying to capture some of the good elements of those games- they've succeeded.What I've grown to appreciate more about Watch Dogs is the ability to blow up streets, set tire spikes, lift bridges and other barriers to keep chasing police/enemies at bay. Yes there are too many times you have to escape via car chase, but these elements make those chases much more interesting.The ability to hack cell phones along the street & cause problems for enemies is pretty sweet. You can really get all the money you may ever want using this pretty easy method. The hacking to open doors in missions presents challenging puzzles along the way.Pros: The game looks great & is next Gen. It's not even close to PS3- open a PS3 game & see the difference. I like great graphics, but most truly open world games have not pushed the graphics envelope (GTA). So don't let this talk dissuade you. This is pretty low on my criteria of what makes a game that's actually fun to play.-Wide variety of missions, side missions, collecting, secret missions, to keep you entertained.-There's also a nice mix of stealth or more straight out shooting types of missions. The stealth elements are appropriately challenging but not impossible as in some games.-Cons- They also try a few Saint's Row crazy side games. Maybe it's a nice change of pace for some, but those really elements don't seem to fit with the tone of Watch Dogs. I'd love some parachute, flying, or boat missions. Those are always great in the GTA games.-There really isn't a great story as most people have related. Although I want to succeed in missions, there really isn't much giving Aiden a real sense of purpose. Again, this is pretty common in games that are this open-world.-Initially I felt ripped off due to the similarity to other games. I can understand those who feel that way. I'd encourage those folks to keep playing to really get a sense of the scope of this game.-For a game that took so long to get into customer hands it would have been great to see some more really original elements. What's there is good- but it could have added something more.-This is the first Pre-sale I've bought for quite a while since most end up as disappointing. Had I waited, I may not have bought it yet due to customer reviews. It wouldn't hurt to wait until the price goes down, but it is worth a shot if you like any of these types of open-world games. Will definitely give you many hours of play & has replayability.-Overall- I definitely recommend it. I'm not over the top as many out there who absolutely love or hate it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Mark Carson","summary":"A decidely mixed bag for me...","reviewText":"I suppose it's obvious I am not a big fan of the series, considering how long I waited to purchase this game.  But I figure anyone sitting on the fence at this point is pretty much like me, so this review is for you.  MGS4 is simultaneously the most amazing and underwhelming game I have played on the PS3.  It paradoxically sucks and rules, but let's go beyond that and break down what (for me) worked and what didn't.  This game is incredible visually...the color pallette is a bit muted (as one would expect from this type of game), and had too many \"Final Fantasy\" type player models in the supporting cast for my taste, but overall oustanding graphics.  The gameplay is at times interesting and varied; I particularly enjoyed the \"on rails\" sections.  But...it does get more than a bit repetitive.  Without spoiling anything, certain boss fights follow a similar pattern, and some just plain disappoint completely.  Getting a load screen about every 300 feet of game area at times is more than a slight annoyance (why all PS3 devs don't just go ahead and ask Naughty Dog for lessons on how to avoid large installs and lengthy load times is beyond me).  And then there are the cut scenes...holy crap, the cut scenes.  Don't get me wrong, some are well done, and a few characters turn in decent performances.  But mostly the scenes are overlong, overly indulgent, and just plain boring.  I found the sporadic attempts at high drama and humor to be mostly just silly.  The majority of reviews indicate many people really like this game, but I wonder what kind of scores it would have gotten had it not come with the Metal Gear label.  I would highly recommend renting this game and playing for a few hours to decide if this one is for you!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002F9005O","description":"","reviewerName":"Quoad Toad","summary":"Can't stop playing","reviewText":"This game was my savior on a recent long flight.  It really helped the hours go by quickly.I was never a huge fan of Bejeweled, but I found myself taking to Bejeweled Twist.  In Bejeweled Twist, the player rotates four gems at a time clockwise, with the goal of matching up at least three gems.  Points are scored by matching up the gems, with extra points for matching large strings of gems or for making multiple matches in a row.The game becomes very challenging when bomb blocks appear, which require the player to match them up within a set amount of time.  At first, this is easy, but in the more advanced levels, it becomes quite challenging when there are several bomb blocks on the screen at once.  Even more challenging, in later levels, the player has to blow up a certain block before the time runs out.  This involves creating a bomb jewel (by matching 4 gems in a row) and then blowing up the bomb jewel next to the appropriate block.  As the game continues, it requires fast thinking and great dexterity.The game also has a \"challenge\" mode where the player is given a variety of challenges to complete - such as matching up a long string of gems or destroying a certain number of gems in a specific time frame.  Each challenge contains about 8 similar tasks which vary in difficulty (for instance level 1 might require the player to destroy  200 blocks in 5 minutes, while level 8 might require the player to destroy 700 blocks in 5 minutes).The game also features a mode that allows players to play freestyle with no winning or losing involved, which I found dull since the challenges were removed.  It also features a two player mode that I haven't had the opportunity to try.Overall, I am having a lot of fun with this game and it's perfect for passing the hours in a long plane ride.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0041OWQUI","reviewerName":"JckDnls","summary":"Falls short but still enjoyable","reviewText":"Borderlands is one of those games that has so much going for it, but falls short of greatness because of some stupid, needless issues.  Graphically, the game is very nice and rarely shows slowdown or \"choppiness\" unless you're in an intense online game.  There's a good dose of humor (always a plus) and lootmongers will enjoy opening every chest from beginning to end.  The base game is also fairly lengthy (I think I spent around 40 hours completing it) and the GOTY contains all of the DLC.  The DLC is mixed in quality, but adds a lot of gameplay for the money.One of the issues I have is with the menu system; the map could use some improvement and the quest tracking is often terrible.  Further complicating things is the online co-op.  It was extremely hard for me to get into games where people were actually close to me in terms where they were or what quests they were on.  Instead of a seamless transition from their game to going back to yours, you have to load up your singleplayer again when you quit and spawn at some predetermined point, often requiring a considerable travel time to get back to where you were.  The quests can also get very repetitive, especially the \"fetch\" quests.  Often you will only have one waypoint, and the game will send you back and forth across large areas on purpose to collect everything.  The fun factor wears off quickly in these situations and it starts to feel like a grind (and there are quite a few quests like this).  Some of the glitches in this game are, in fact, nearly game-breaking  (achievement hunters google \"It's Like Christmas glitch\" to save yourself a huge amount of wasted time and anger).  The fact Gearbox never fixed this is inexcusable and makes the entire Knoxx DLC less fun than what it could've been.Overall, the game still offers quite a bit for the asking price, which is honestly the only reason it earns four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2012"}

Rather than an ambitious next-gen RPG, it seemed like a typical Miyazaki-inspired bright-eyed youthful \"We'll NEVER give up!\" romp/quest that I've played seemingly hundreds of times over the last 15 years or so. Then the demo came out a few months ago, and after playing it a couple of times I had completely lost all interest in Blue Dragon. And that was that... or so I thought.[...]For the most part, all of my fears were confirmed. The story and characters are as dull, banal and insipid as I thought they'd be. The characters are a half step away from being literally blank slates. The story is incredibly dull... even when it predictably picks up a bit of steam in the final act. The battle and ability systems aren't exactly old school or old fashioned, but they're certainly not cutting edge, unless you still consider ideas from 2001 to be cutting edge. I must admit, the battles are much more fun in the full game than they were in the demo. (Giving you access to pretty much every single ability in the game in the demo was a huge mistake.)The two things I find myself truly enjoying are exploring the dungeons, and the graphics. The dungeons are very well designed and laid out, and the the whole affair is very easy on the eyes. We've finally reached the point where an in-game engine looks as nice and solid as FMV cutscenes... from 1997.EDIT: I apologize for the bracketed sections and bizarre disjointedness of this review.

The characters are good and the mecha models are very solidly designed, with seamless and flowing graphics throughout the game. Explosions look nice and the particle effects really lend themselves to the futuristic setting. The details and environments also do an excellent job of emphasizing the scale.Graphics: 7.5/10Sound effects in this game are fitting and appropriate. The slashes of your charged particle sword sound believable and the basic energy shots may not be astounding but nothing in the game is irritating or sub-standard. The only problem is that music, voices, and sound effects can't be altered independently - the only option is 'stereo' and 'mono', but at least the volume leveling is intelligent so the music never drowns out the effects, and the voices are always clearly audible.Sound: 7.9/10There are some beautiful pieces, though the majority is meant more for ambiance. The worst you'll hear is 'forgettable', and the rest depends on your taste.Music: 7.6/10Execution is where this game really shines. The action is fast-paced and intensive, but rarely if ever aggravating (and even then only against some challenging bosses and bomb puzzle). No game before this has ever challenged the sensation of a war machine that is not just powerful but also fast and agile, and the final boss fight is a work of art against a frame quite nearly Jehuty's equal. Although the run-up to the boss might be nerve-wracking the ending is more than worth it. The fun of playing is so good, you'll be replaying it even though it lacks a 'new game plus'. Versus is surprisingly fun, it's the only game I know if that doesn't do split-screen when you play a friend: instead one player is in the foreground and the other in the background and the camera smoothly tracks both.Gameplay: 9.5/10Besides the pleasure of the play-through, the only thing you gain by re-playing the game is unlocking more options in the versus mode. Fortunately, the Versus match is quite fun in itself, allowing you to pick and choose your Frame and go up against almost anybody you've faced, excluding the enormous bosses. Matches can be quick or long and both you and your friend will enjoy them. Play with a friend or against the A.I.Replayability: 3/10This game really shows what it means to hit hard and fast, despite its short length (an inexperienced gamer could finish it in less than 10 hours). The only complaint I had was that the controls on the menu was 'backwards' - the circle confirms and 'x' button cancels. PS3 owners with the limited-compatibility models will be pleased to know this game plays as well here as on the PS2.Overall: 8.6/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Spence","summary":"Surprisingly lackluster and derivative.","reviewText":"First off, yes, I'm a fan of Call of Duty. I enjoy it. I also enjoyed the last two battlefield entries. This game was very hyped up, and it looked very good. I was starting to think it might even be better than Mordern Warfare 3. Not being certain, I decided to rent the game and see if it's worth the $60 purchase.No. No it isn't. First of all, I couldn't play the multiplayer, as you have to purchase the game new in order to even get online. If you have a rental/used copy, you must spend another $10 for an online pass. This, to put it mildly, is a total ripoff. So the game has no resale value, and if you choose to purchase used you have to spend an extra $10 just to play online. Way to go EA, you just lost my possible purchase on that alone.So, frustrated, I began playing the campaign instead. It starts out pretty cool, and it looks great, but as I got deeper into it I saw it for what it was: an attempt to beat Call of Duty by doing a Call of Duty style campaign. This is especially disappointing, as all I heard about was how this game was striving for \"realism.\" In the first 30 minutes I blew up a building, survived an earthquake, survived being shot point blank by a tank, and heard the \"F\" word about 40 times. Unfortunately, it comes off as a sad attempt at Call of Duty action movie style gameplay, and it doesn't work.I was also disappointed in the visuals. For all the hoopla about the new graphics engine, it didn't look particularly better than any of the other games I've played recently. Crysis 2, Deus Ex, even Modern Warfare 2 all looked comparable or better than this. The much talked about destructible environments appear to be missing from my copy. Red Faction would laugh directly in this games face before smashing it with a sledge hammer. The physics are also glitchy and kind of crazy. When I shoot somebody with a shotgun from 10 feet away, I don't expect them to fly across half the map. Or shoot straight up in the air, or slide across the ground. But they do, and frequently. It's a bit like playing one of those crazy modes from Goldeneye, except all the time.So they won't let me play the multiplayer because they are money grubbers, and it didn't take me long to find complaints online about lag, disconnecting, etc. Also, the campaign is a lame attempt at replicating the game that DICE was trying to beat this holiday season. The graphics aren't that impressive, the destructible environments barely destruct, and dead enemies fly around like they're on some sort of morbid pogo-stick. So, essentially, Battlefield 3 is not only a bad game, but also completely full of both itself and... something else. something smelly.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005YVTW","description":"You are the vampire Kain, the most evil figure ever to appear in a video game. Cloaked in stealth, you will move unseen through crowds, travel stories above the peasant herds on which you feed--leaping from rooftop to rooftop--and use mind control to overcome vampire-proof inventions. The combat choreography unfolds with dancelike precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike. The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves are designed to appeal to even the most jaded of fighting-game fans. The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"Vicente Drago \"Shaun O'Donnell\"","summary":"A fun game and good continuation to LEgacy of KAin","reviewText":"Blood Omen was one of PSX early titles.  the over the top perspective helped tell the tale of KAin, a noble slain by a group of assassins hired by a mysteriouse benefactor.  While in the fires of Hell Kain is given the opportunity to avenge his murder, at a price.  Kain returned as a vampire to slay his assassins. From there he found out that only he could save nosgoth from the corruption that had fallen upon the pillars, which control the essence of life.  After slaying the guardians, the final which not only ressurected him, but had him killed as well.  Kain was given the choice to either sacrafice himself for he was the final pillar, or reject the choice and help insure Nosgoths destruction.  He chose the later which helps build the story of the second game.In the time since then KAin has created an army of Vampires and went on the warpath.  The sarafan were reestablished in the hope that the vampire menace would be defeated.  The sarafan lord eventually defeats kain and the armys are scattered.  Kain however not dead but in a deep sleep for he next 200 years.  Kain is awaken to a time when the Sarafan are no longer just protectors but tyrants.  The vampires lead the resistance to stop the sarafan.  Kain weakened must go in and help the resistance to get revenge towards the sarafan lord, as well as rebuild his army and continue his conquest.THe game itself is not set up as the passt entries were.  Instead of nonlinear gameplay and a huge world to explore, the game is seperated by levels, where you continue to build your swtrength and gain skills, by this method the story does not get lost as the player may at times.  However by doing this the game also loses some of the appeal that Blood Omen and Soul Reaver had.The difficulty is like the first Blood Omen in that it is a challenge to play through.  Some of the humans are dumb and just run away screaming while the guards will whip you...if you are not careful.  The bosses are sometimes stupid but to fight them is in the set up of puzzles.Speaking of puzzles that is the primary weak point of the game.  The puzzles are all involving switches.  Flip this, turn that, push this.  SO in that manner it detracts from the game.  But over all this is definetly a must own for those who are fans of the legacy of Kain series.  It is definetly a great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2002"}

Believe me, u will love it","reviewText":"Killzone 2 is one of the best first person shooters i have ever played.The graphics and audio in this game is one of the best i have ever seen. Amazing animations, life-like visuals, great character models, incredible textures, awesome gun models outstanding VO (voice overs) and the explosions in this game never get old. This is one of the most atmospherics games ever, when you play this game you fell that your in a middle of a huge war. Grenades are blowing up everywhere and bullets flying every directions. This makes it a extremely intense game.The gameplay is also outstanding. When you are using a weapon, every bullet effects the enemies. And like i said before, this game is really intense so you never want to put the controller down. They also added a cover mechanic which works really well. There are many different environments you will be fighting on and the environments look amazing. Also there is a good variety in weapons. Every weapon is extremely fun. The A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) is also very smart. When you throw a grenade they will jump away and duck for cover.Also, Killzone 2 has one of the best multiplayer ive played so you will be playing this game for a very long time.BUY THIS GAME!!!!  andWhat a roller coaster ride this game is, it is like watching an action packed blockbuster that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the the film is finished........... But the difference with this is it is not a film and you feel that you are right in the middle of the action and any mistake you make will get you head blown off, until you realise that it is a game and still you get your head blown off.It is so fast paced that you have the sensation that the only time you can relax is when you get to the end of each episode and the game is saved............ You then take a deep breath and carry on eagerly with great trepidation.I love everything about this game, it's graphics, storyline, characters, scenery, the pace, the weaponry etc etc There is no doubt that it is a difficulty game to play and there are times when you scream profanities at the screen and wish it was a much easier game to play but what is the fun in that.........

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch.

After much roaming around empy corridors and wards with no random battles or anything of note happening, your patience is finally rewarded when everything suddenly plunges into chaos as the whole world is obliterated before your eyes. This is not a spoiler by any means, in fact your adventure only really begins when you awake after this wipe-out and find that your entire existance is changed forever...Wow, this is somewhat different from RPG's that I am used to.

But thanks to him, you are now a half-human, half-demon, with strength and magical powers beyond your understanding. And you will need them too, to fight your way through this bewildering new world.To start with the basics, any RPG is only as good as it's battle system, and this game has a pretty good one...here are the main points: Fighting is turn-based, although in this game the whole side gets all their actions over with before the turn passes to the enemies, so you can choose all your actions and see how they pan out before they proceed to take all their turns. Now here's where things get interesting. A number of \"turn\" icons appears on the screen to let you know how many actions you have remaining before the round switches to the enemy. You can add extra turns to your round if an attack exploits the enemies particular weakness (such as hitting a fire demon with an ice attack). And the more you do it, the more turns you can chain together. Of course it's not always as easy as guessing that ice magic beats fire. And if you are careless or have not established the enemies weakness, you run the risk of hitting it with something that it is immune to or, worse still, that can heal it. And if you do this, you LOSE one or sometimes even all of your upcoming turns. I think this system is really clever. It means you can never just bash away with your best skills without thinking. Plus it also means that if the enemy attacks your weak spots or manages to miss you, it will also build up or lose turns in the same way. So fighting is a battle of wits as much as power, and some harder bosses can never be whipped unless you find away to stop them taking all your turns away and having loads of extra goes themselves. Great fun. And luckily save points are quite liberal so you can always weed out the weaknesses of difficult enemies by trial and error (this is especially crucial for some bosses), and then reload and go into battle fully prepared.The other novel thing about the fighting is that you are to all intents and purposes the only playable character. Well, you are certainly the only human character. But, you will be aided and supported in battle by a legion of weird and wonderful monsters that you meet throughout the game and manage to convince to join your party. This adds a new dimension to fighting, as you can choose to break off the battle at any time and use the \"talk\" command. This allows you to negotiate with any monster you are currently fighting and see if you can get them to join your team. Now, there are dozens of variables that dictate whether this succeeds or not...they may ask for steep sums of money or rare items, or they may pose moral dilemmas and make their decison based on whether they like your answer. Sometimes other enemies may step in and mess it up for you. At other times you may be surprised to find that the monsters themselves actually ask to come with you in return for sparing their life, which is quite nice!  Although this one usually only happens with enemies who are at a lower level that you are...try asking a high level monster to surrender and you'll just be laughed at. Anyway, it all adds more to the gameplay, especially as there is never a sure-fire formula for winning a new monster, they are an unpredictable lot at best. You can hand over huge wads of cash and jewels, only to be told at the last minute: \"I'm sorry, I just don't think we are compatible\"...bah!So, once you are holding a good supply of monsters (limited to about 6-8 at the start of the game), you can select a team of three to participate in battle with you. If a battle starts and you realise the monsters in your team have got the wrong skills for this particular fight, you can use the \"summon\" command to swap any of them with one from your reserves. It's that easy. Your monsters level up with experience the same as you, and learn new skills if you let them. Refreshingly, all your stats are customizable, but those of your monster allies are not. If they level up they may learn a new skill or change an existing one, or even evolve into a whole new monster if you let them. But none of this can be predicted, and the results can be fantastic, or they can cause you to regret it!  Now, I said this was refreshing, although on paper it sounds like it could potentially be a complete nightmare as all your careful plans go awry because your monster went and changed the skill you were depending on into a completely useless one. It happened to me when my Pixie changed her healing magic into one I really didn't want, called \"Taunt\"...and I was ages on from my last save. So save often if a monster is getting close to levelling up - thankfully a \"points until next level\" counter is always at hand for you to check on! But in reality, the times when the changes end up being worse are very rare, and I found it great fun to see what new spells my monsters produced. It's also a proud moment to see the unexpected times that a monster you have been training up finally mutates into a brand new creature. It does not happen to all of them, and you can't foresee it, but when it does, it's always an enhancement in all departments.But even that's not all. In each \"town\" there is usually a place you can go and \"fuse\" your monsters together, which, put simply, means combining two monsters to make a new, more powerful one. This process is also really good fun - and this time it's all under your control. The process lets you see every outcome available before you commit to doing the fusion, which is really important as otherwise you would be saving and re-loading forever to get a good result. As you may expect, there are many factors involved in fusing that can affect the result, so be prepared to spend a long time on this if you want to make some really high ranking, rare monsters. You'll need to spend a lot of time ammassing a team with a nice selection of skills, too because you'll need plenty of back-up for the bosses. And in this regard, be prepared for some real trials. The Matador ( a really cool-looking skeleton in a bull-fighter's outfit) that you encounter a few hours into the game makes for a huge jump in difficulty and for a while I thought I must have got to the area he was in before I was supposed to (I hadn't - he's just hard!). Of course after finally beating him I wanted him in my team and to my delight I was able to fuse him later, and now he works for me...another very satisfying aspect.Now that I have praised the game enough, I need to list the drawbacks. Although there are not many, and the fun with the monster team is good enough to outweigh them....My first niggle is a simple problem of localization. The names of the monster families, spells and abilities are impossible to remember, being, as they are, all Japanese in origin. So, for example Agi is the name of the basic fire spell, while Media is the name of one of the healing spells, and a defence raising spell is known as Rakukaja.  And sometimes (as in the case of fusion or skill replacing) you need to know what something is pretty sharpish before you can make a desicion...would you prefer your demon to keep Tarunda or replace it with Makajam? You also can't name the monsters in your team, and I spent a lot of time early on having to check the Status menu to see which one was the fire-pixie (it was Hua-Po), and work out which one Nozuchi was (a big hairball with feet and an elephant's trunk, if you must know). I suppose it's good to learn something akin to a foreign language, but as there easily over 100 different skills and types of monster classes in total, it's almost impossible to remember what they are without a guide.Secondly, I found the graphics quite...unusual. Although the characters are very chic and dynamic looking cel animations, the locations can be severely bland. Most noticeably in the early hospital and shopping mall sections, every single room was identical, with a distinct lack of variety anywhere in the level as a whole. Apart from being boring, it means you have a lot of trouble knowing whereabouts in the building you are. At least the game provides a very good map for every indoor level, unlike the outdoor areas which appear as a drastically miniatuarised landscape for which there is no \"world map\", so exploration with trial and error is really your only option here. The battle animations are quite good though, with some very nice spell effects - although the characters \"dodge\" animation is absurd - it's a completely static \"slide\" to one side and back again, which looks like just plain lazy animation. The monsters look great, and they all have a little signature \"victory dance\" move that you can see when they level up - some were so cute I was actually reluctant to fuse them...I miss my little Shiisaa...I would recommend this game to lovers of RPGs - and if you are the type who likes a bit of experimentation, you're in for a treat. You might have to make your own notes to keep track of a lot of things, though! And the dungeons are often both puzzle-based and maze like so expect to get lost a fair bit too, which adds to the overall time!You should have hours of fun with this game. I was wary of an RPG that had a large bias towards munster hunting...I didn't want to play Pokemon. But it turned out to be very addictive and fun to play. Even when it was hard work it was good...I soon realised that when boss battles were too hard I was just going in without paying attention to strategy - because just being buffed up is NOT the key to success in this game. But with lots of saving, you should never be too frustrated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2006"}

This is one of the first next-gen games I gave a shot, partially because of the price and partially because of the reviews.Let's just say, to me, this game is amazing. I would like to disagree with the critical reviews in every way.The graphics work great for the game; they are an anime style most people will enjoy. The shading is also very colorful contrary to the reviews.The level of gore IS a lot more extreme than Resident Evil or House of the Dead, both of which I played long before this game. Also there is a lot of cussing....The game play is much more complex than flinging the remote around. You attack high and low, you stun high and low, you recharge your weapon, you block high and low, you dodge enemy attacks high and low, you use finishing moves, and you use throwing moves. The controls are simple, but when you play long enough, battle is a complex and rewarding experience.The game, in general, is about the main character wanting to become the best assassin. He is the 11th best assassin and must kill the top 10 to be the best. The boss battles are the 10 top assassins and there are plenty of enemies in between. Between boss battles you need to complete missions and earn money. With the money you can train and develop your character.Over all, this game is a lot of fun, complex combat, good story and dialog, and tons of gore. I would recommend this to any fan of action games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2008"}

This was one of the most inventive games I ever played, and is a legend even today, at least to me. Chrono Trigger stood out with its combo attacks, its battle system and of course, the time-travel, along with the unique side-quests. Honestly, there are so many possible endings, and different ways you can play this game. I also liked replaying the game after I defeated Lavos, thus being able to start a new game with the stats I had completed the last game with (making enemies really easy to beat)What made this game stand out most was the time-travel and how things you did in one time period would affect the rest, as well as the time-travel aspects of some of the sidequests along with the main quest. It's too bad that one of the Final Fantasy games didn't have time travel or anything like that.

J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"The games that launched an empire....","reviewText":"It pains me. Only when all nine planets are in perfect alignment is it possible for me to hate a Square-Enix game. For the game to come from the much-loved Final Fantasy franchise, there has to be a lunar and solar eclipse at the same time. Anyone's heard the story right? Square was a struggling developer back in the eighties facing bankrupty. They made a RPG styled after Dragon Quest, Japan's top-selling RPG, which turned into a mega-hit, saving the company and launching one of the most revered videogame series ever.It's strange that I never played Final Fantasy when it first came out on NES. I know that my family owned the cartridge, but I'd never played it. I figured that the first game would be something special. Final Fantasy to me has always been the epic stories, the memorable characters, and the solid gameplay mechanics. Those were the qualities that just enthralled me when I became hooked on Final Fantasy II (the 4th one really) for the SNES. Unfortunately, the story is barely there and the characterization is nil. You are a band of heroes that is plopped down in a medival fantasy world and given the task of restoring the four crystals which will save the world. That's it. Most of the time you are wandering about aimlessly, trying to figure out where you are supposed to go. The method of exploration is go into cave, if monsters kill you in one hit, leave cave and find another. There are some towns you can visit and be treated to wonderful dialogue like \"Bless the Crystal!\" only thing half the idiots in this world say.If that weren't frustrating enough, this is a really hard game. Unfortunately, the difficulty feels like it comes from poor game design than actually being meant to challenge you. Perpare to spend tons of time leveling up. You'll be attacked often, after one or two steps sometimes, the monsters appear in droves, and your attacks will miss as much as they hit. In dungeons, there are no save points for you to save and restore your health with a tent. The healing items and magic is woefully inadequate most of the time. The magic system is also messed up. Instead of having magic points to use as you please, Magic is divided into 8 levels and you can buy 3 spells from each level. You can only use magic from each level a certain number of time. This annoying because by the time you reach level ten most of the low level spells are practically obsolete but you'll have tons of them and few higher level spells. There are also no items to revive fallen party members, so you have to leave the dungeon, track back to town, and get a priest to revive you. This is really annoying when the town doesn't have a priest and you have to go halfway around the world to find one.I managed to play for 10 hours before I could stand no more. Final Fantasy II is a little better. You play as a group of youths fighting for a rebel resistance movement. The characters have personalities and the game actually gives you missions to accomplish. However, I didn't like the leveling system. Depending on how you fight, your stats increase and decrease accordingly. You'd think that would have the characters highly customizable? Wrong! The characters are still inclined towards certain jobs and weapon types. Maria has low HP and can't hit the broad side of a barn, so she has to be a mage. Give her a javeline instead of her bow and arrow and some animals will have gone extinct before she lands another hit. It takes forever to get the stats to increase.The presentation of the games are pretty good. The graphics and spell effects are bright and attractive. The music is still exceptional. If you loved Final Fantasy I when it first came out and have been itching to play it again, ignore this review and buy this right away. These games have never looked better and they come will a host of unlockable extras. For everyone else looking to play the RPGs are yesteryear, get Final Fantasy Chronicles or Anthology, as Square has perfected the formula for RPGs by then.Final Fantasy Origins is a relic of a long-ago era in gaming that has aged like Buddy Hackette. It's a definitely a historic benchmark for the industry, but for me it's only novelty is that it shows that \"You've come along way, Baby!\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2004"}

They look good enough to be released on the PS3. The cutscenes that use the ingame engine do look pixelated, but the cutscenes that use CG look really good. The ingame action looks great and Santa Monica Studios should be rewarded for this remastered collection. The games themselves should be tried by all fans of the genre. They have a nice story throughout, even though the second lacks in this department. If you've never played it then give it a shot, or if your a long time fan then refresh you memory for God of War 3. I had never played either of these titles before I bought this set. I have since preordered God of War 3: The Ulitmate Edition. Below are my reviews of both games, and don't worry no major spoilers are revealed. The set overall gets a 4/5.God of WarGod of War has a little problem with pacing. It starts out strong then tapers off towards the middle but then picks up in a major way toward the end of the game. The main problem with pacing is the the amount of puzzles. You just get through a room full of guys, and the action stops as you have to figure out how to move a doorway into place. They're not that hard, but I wish they would have given you some more clues as what to do. You are allowed to go back to where you were before, and this leads to unnecessary backtracking sometimes.The combat is flawless, the special moves are well developed and you gain a form of XP through the game to upgrade them. The controls to use them is is also very well done. As you can switch between a special move, and a medium attack without ever missing a beat. The climbing sequences do get annoying as they were not necessary. They are not particuraly difficult just that it slows the game down, as Kratos is the slowest climber in video game histroy.The story is pretty well done, and really escalades throughout the game. The ending of this game is epic. I wish Kratos would have had more lines, but the voiceover of his journey is nicely done. It was a little slow in the beginning, but as you peel away Kratos's story it really picks up well.There are some annoying very PS2 like problems in GOW. There is no auto save in the game. You have to walk into a golden column, and manually save. This really gets annoying after the millionth time doing it. Also the respawning of enemies is terrible. You think you killed everyone in the room, and someone hits you from behind. Also the number of times your enemies respawns increases as you get farther in the game. It's supposed to increase the difficulty, but just makes it frustrating. Finally the camera angle is a problem. You can't rotate the camera, and there are more than a few ocassions where you're not able to see where to go, because the camera is staring at Kratos's face instead of the path ahead.Overall this game had a great story, kick butt action, exciting unlockable powers and of course an even amount of blood spewing courpses added in. There were some frustrating parts in this game that invloves the puzzles, but a great game none the less. I wish I could have played this when it came out as now I have been spoiled by some great PS3 games, still God of War holds it's own, even though it will soon be five years old. Overall 4.5/5God of War 2This game really started off very well in the first two or three hours. The story was engaging and full of twists. The only problem is that after that point there was very little story development until the end. The game just seemed to drag on like the developers had a minimum length that the game had to be, and they just added rooms for no reason to meet it. There are very few cutscenes in this game. Most of them appear in the beginning, or end of the game. They should have made the game shorter, and the story should have been better written. It does end very nicely as it gets ready for God of War 3, but it didn't make up for the eight or so hours in between where very little happened to move the story forward.The combat in the game is basically the same as the original. They have given you some weapons other than your blades, but the blades still work the best as the new weapons seem to be powerful but slow and bulky. The new powers you gain are given a different name, but are very similar to the ones that you had in God of War 1. The only exception is the demon souls are part of one of your weapon upgrades. I didn't know this and unlocked them last, therefore I was unable to take advantage of them. The developers also took away the L1+X attack from the first one. This was my favoirite attack, but for some reason was taken out this time around.There is a new whip system in place. You can swing from hook to hook, but it isn't used as often as I would have liked. In this game you can also fly and stop time. They are way overused throughout the course of the game, and become annoying not fun to use.The puzzles in this game are on par with the first game. I didn't have as much fun with them though. They seem to be more monotonous than challanging. Moving a statue into place in order to open a door for the hundreth time gets very taxing on your nerves.The same save system is used from the first one. There is no autosave in either God of War and that becomes annoying. The enemy respawn problem from the first game is not as evident in this title. Both games do have a nice feature that allows you to watch all the cutscenes in order. This game has like 4 cutscenes so it's not as impressive as the half an hour of cutscenes from the original. The camera angle was not a problem for me, even though it is fixed I never had difficulties seeing what I was doing like I did in the original. Also the climbing is better developed. He climbs faster this time around, and these stages are not a big problem.Overall this game was entertaining for the most part. The story should have had a bigger role than it did. The original kills the sequal in story quality. The game seems to drag on and lasts for over eleven hours. That's not too long I know, but with the lack of a story through the middle made it seem like a hundred hours. The new powers were annoying and overused. The whip was a nice addition, but didn't seem to get used to it's full potential. The game was a decent adventure that atleast built to a nice conclusion, keeping us in suspense for God fo War 3.

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed.

Much like the sequel, Jak and sometimes Daxter must accomplish a variety of tasks to prove their worth, which include everything from driving challenges and arena fighting to hang gliding and just shooting things to smithereens. It's literally more of what made Jak II so popular--having all sorts of gameplay modes that smoothly mesh with the entire story. Halfway through the game, the story starts to actually unfold, and the two heroes find themselves uncovering a plot that not only connects the politics of the old city, but also somehow involves the fate of the entire world. Jak's world is essentially two worlds in one. You can actually shuttle between both free-roaming towns and explore or take on various tasks at your leisure. There's a lot to see, too. Each town is designed to have distinct neighborhoods that come alive with their own detailed structures, colorful topography, and wandering inhabitants. And like in two, you can get around faster by \"borrowing\" a hovercraft, or, if you're in the countryside, a two-legged oversized rodent. Indeed, the core of Jak 3 is the multifaceted gameplay. But if you thought some of the challenges tipped your frustration level to high last time, just wait until you play through this third round. While completing most objectives can be moderately challenging, there are a handful of missions that can easily fill your rage meter, which newbies to the series might not appreciate. Jak 3 also tries to utilize every type of button combination--a trying task especially when you need to quickly remember how to switch between four weapons (with multiple variations), dark and light power, your hoverboard, and various fist and jump attacks. Still, although it can be overwhelming at times, being a part of all the different action is actually a fun experience. True, various gameplay styles have been included in other games, but Jak 3 does it the best. It is about presentation, and Jak 3 presents the action in an engaging, meaningful way that keeps you glued to the very end. Jak certainly continues his charm as a classic adventurer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00BRQN2H4","description":"","reviewerName":"Mali","summary":"Virtual Reality & Aliens Can Be Fun?","reviewText":"Anyone expecting a follow-up to the last Saint's game may be disappointed if they don't keep an open mind. It IS in many ways exactly like the last one, with a new story. And just minutes into the game, that new story is revealed to be that you are the President of the United States. That's when the alien's attack. They aren't little green men, but giant muscly thugs that look like they are on steroids.The main alien- or head alien, Zinyak, is intelligent, poetic, and he hates how stupid and thoughtless humans can be. Instead of killing you you kidnaps you and drops you into a simulation of Steelport that is suppose to be based on your worst nightmares. And in the beginning it is. You are in 1950's America until you shoot your way out of the illusion. After that, it's missions to bring down Zinyak and rescue other players or go on missions to disrupt the simulation. I personally think that both aliens and zombies are overdone, but the humor in this story, plus the intelligence of Zinyak is enough to get past that. Also the super powers which basically make the cars and planes pointless and guns kind f secondary.In the past, we relied on cars to take us across town to missions. Now, probably prematurely, we get super speed running right away, and it upgrades into never running out. So you can literally speed across town at high speeds instead of driving and never stop. And why would you drive when it takes longer? It's kind of a shame because the streets and cars are so detailed, as in the last game. Around that time, you gain the power to super jump which lets you leap up tall buildings and jump across them. After that you get Glide which may be my favorite. This allows you to jump off that high rise tower and glide across the city to each destination. Like flying. Shortly after you get the ability to run straight up a building instead of jumping and bouncing up bit by bit. Hitting the ground does not hurt you because this is a simulation. The super powers you use to fight include in order, freeze, fire, telekinesis (mind lift people and throw them), stomp, and telekinesis energy drain. You also can upgrade guns to alien type which means it has a laser that needs to recharge instead of bullets. Other weapons include the dub step gun that kills with music, the black hole gun that sucks people into a black hole, and a floppy adult toy bat. The side mission that you need to unlock these powers (that and scattered power orbs you collect like currency) are the Fraud missions, tank missions, Genki missions that are much like the ones from SR3, but with new ones like alien ships and other alien themes. You also fight waves of enemies to take over the town just like in 3, but with super powers you can jump to the top of a building and aim from there. Unless you have flying enemies they can't get up that high. You also hack stores with a pipe/lazer puzzle that can be challenging and impossible alternately. I think I preferred when you could buy them.The downside is sometimes odd and unfun missions where for example, you are a 2-bit tank that upgrades into a modern tank, you fly a ship through crevices, or you drive a bike. The bikes in simulation are terrible to control, and the ship scene in the beginning is tedious and not fun.Lastly I wanted to mention that in the beginning the game was plagued with bugs and glitches.Now, in 2014, I have picked the game back up and started over, and in 5 days, it has frozen randomly three times. It freezes the entire PS3 and you need to get up and restart it. It also has glitched in a tower and refused to let me out via invisible walls more than once. If you look on Youtube you can find all kind of glitches recorded. I actually e-mailed the company, and their response was that they already released patches, and that I should try the game on a friend's PS3 to see if it was my PS3 or the disc. Okay. So who is going to let me borrow their Ps3 for a few days OR let me come over and sit on their couch for 6 hours a few days in a row to see if it glitches eventually? Oh, I'm just going to be in your living room shooting aliens, don't mind me...They said that it is not normal to for it to glitch or freeze that many times, but look on the internet and you will see that it happen to numerous people. I mentioned that which they ignored. The problem here is that i like this game, but at this point, with it glitching and freezing, I may not get to finish it. The only times this has ever happened was with Assasin's Creed 3 and 4 (3 was plagued with glitches and freezes and although I hated it, I finished it and took it right back to Redbox), and one boss in Lego Lord of the Rings. And I own over 40 games. So apparently their patch did not fix everything. Think about that before you buy this game, because some freezing experiences I have read have been worse than mine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2014"}

To be honest, they didn't even get the violence right. It's not clever enough to be funny, and too comical to be serious. I beat the game a day after buying it and sold it the day after that.So why a 3 out of 5 overall rating? Despite the obnoxious announcers who oftentimes repeat the same sentence 3 or more times in a row, the horrid soundmix and disappointing-for-a-rental gameplay length, there's something that Madworld has that many Wii games don't: Potential. At least the developers tried to make something a little different and they get an \"E\" for \"Effort\".The art direction is taken from Sin City and, for the most part, works. With a lot of fine tuning and initiative Madworld 2 could potentially turn into a good game. But as things are, the original Madworld is nothing more than a curiosity. An \"M\" rated game for the Wii. Although it isn't made for kids, it is, in many ways, more childish than whatever party game preceded it. Having looked forward to this game for a while now, I was very disappointed in its eventual gameplay.Here's hoping The Conduit finally gets it right.

Not only did I love the cinematic approach they took in Mass Effect 2, but I also accounted the leap forward from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2. The combat from 1 to 2 was updated to be faster paced, more mobility and an over all more polished experience. The conversation system was improved adding more camera angles so each discussion was like a well directed movie. The emotional ties to each character was multiplied as well.So, in short, I guess what I am getting at is I value the quality of a product AND what improvements have been made.I HATE paying $60 for a re-hash of the same game. I have no problem with more of the same, but that should be under the title Downloadable content. If there are going to be real improvements then that warrants a full purchase.That said, right here, right now I want to dethrone Mass Effect 2, holder of Best Xbox 360 RPG game for over a year and hand it to Dragon age 2.Surprised? You shouldn't be. Download the demo.The game has had a MASSIVE overhaul! The graphics are now on par with its cousin Mass Effect 2, and the storytelling is far more engaging.

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Little Mermaid 2?....NOT!!!","reviewText":"I loved Bioshock; I became immediately immersed in it and spent well over 20 hours completing it during my first playthrough because there was so much to explore in the game. Bioshock 2 is no different. What a cool game Bioshock 2 is so far. Let me say up front that I haven't finished it, and I don't want to be finished. I have played for over 6 hours and I don't get the impression that I'm remotely close to finishing.After 6 hours, I'm sure that I could have gotten a lot farther in the game than I am a lot faster, but you can prolong the game by exploring areas that may not be the most direct route to your goal. And I spend a lot of time exploring. These little explorations are usually fruitful, because hidden throughout the expansive game are all kinds of weapons, perks and information about where you've once again suddenly found yourself captive: In the underwater city of Rapture. (Edit 3/1/10: Finished the game and the game is as good as the rest of this review suggests. Spent, I'd say, well over 15 hours playing. Extensive searching kept my ammo and \"Eve\" full at all times.)The game begins with a flashback cutscene with you as a Big Daddy protecting a Little Sister apparently just before the events of the first game. The cutscene ends badly for you, but you are suddenly \"reactivated\" about 10 years later within Andrew Ryan's utopian city of Rapture now under the control of a woman named Sofia Lamb, and Lamb is not happy to see you. Did I say utopian city? Well, that may have been the original idea, but the Rapture you ultimately find yourself in is the antithesis of a utopia and in even worse shape than in the first Bioshock. I believe the term is dystopia. Anyway, a familiar name contacts you and helps guide you, a Big Daddy, to your goals.The good news is that in Bioshock 2, unlike Bioshock 1, your peripheral vision isn't limited like it was by the Big Daddy helmet. Remember that part in Bioshock 1 where you became the Big Daddy and you had to escort the Little Sister? That was one of the tougher parts on the game, no? Well, it looks like we're in for a lot of that in Bioshock 2.You are given goals and roadblocks o'plenty to prevent you from easily reaching your goals. The few people (called Splicers) left in Rapture that you run into have all gone (are still) stark raving mad, and they'll ruin your day or the Little Sister's day that you're trying to protect if you let them get too close. And don't trip a security alarm; it'll summon armed drones and more Splicers. At the beginning of the first level you get a quick glimpse of something that looks a lot worse than a Splicer, and it becomes clear that the gene altering that was going on in the first one has been taken to the next level in this one.At least it's easier to hack everything from security cameras to drones to vending machines to safes in Bioshock 2. Not only can you hack from a distance by firing a \"hack dart\" at a machine like a gun turret, the hacking itself is a new timed system that is based on stopping a needle that moves back in forth over a color coded grid versus the first game's complete the puzzle before time runs out system.You get all kinds of weapons and occasional opportunities to upgrade your weapons. You're well equipped. And this time not only do you get the Big Daddy's Rivet Gun, but also his oversize drill. The drill is quite effective so far on Splicers and saves on precious ammo; there's a new melee attack added to your defense system and a melee with the drill equipped is almost as effective as the drill itself. You get the a camera again too to take pictures that allow you to conduct research on your foes to increase the damage you can inflict on them and lessen the damage that they inflict on you (don't worry...all you have to do is take the dang picture; the research is done automatically).In addition to the corpses strewn throughout the game that can be searched for goodies, so is ammo, money and other knick-knacks that will help you progress. Just be sure to search everything if you want to maximize your strength. And speaking of maximizing your strength, one of the first things you get are, just like the first game, Plasmids...or put another way...special abilities. Telekinesis. Pyrokinesis. And a bunch of other Plasmid \"kinesises\" are unlocked pending your ability to find or buy them. Try picking something heavy up with your telekinesis and throwing it at your enemy...better yet, plant a few Trap Rivets on that thing before you toss it! You're also granted \"tonics\" to customize your character with. Stuff like armor, various strengths, first aid boosts, and secondary damage on your enemies from your weapons or from just plain old being attacked. Really cool stuff.Unlike most games, but just like Bioshock 1, the game lets you save at any time, and when you restart play it starts you at the exact place you last saved...not at the last checkpoint. Nice. Very nice. So right before you get to what you think might be a tough part...save! Cuz if you play \"poorly\", you can just quit and try again.Like any game with redundant enemies (thinkRE4'sganados orUncharted'spirates), the Splicers become quite annoying, but I suppose that's the idea. And yup, you even need to battle with other Big Daddies again. And as tough as they are, wait until you have to battle your newest foe, the Big Sister. My first battle with one of these didn't go so well. Thank goodness for the save anywhere feature! You have GOT to remember to hit that first aid button before your health runs out. You reload automatically, and your Plasmids will recharge automatically (if you've got some Eve), but you don't heal automatically.Your goals change all the time. Just when you think you've attained a critical goal...it backfires or you're immediately given another that requires backtracking...and then backtracking again. But rest assured it never gets boring. The eerie atmospheres and creepy environments that Bioshock's creators have put together are more than effective. Some areas are really creepy, and there's nothing worse than not being able to find your way out of those which isn't always easy. But that's the fun! Oh yeah, and now that you're in the Big Daddy suit, you're even required to make it through some underwater (or should I say in the water) adventures.If you like shooters or survival / horror games...Bioshock 2 is for you. The first game isreally cheaphere at Amazon, and I'd highly recommend that you play it first for chronology's sake. But chronology is completely unnecessary for Bioshock 2. Come to think of it....play Bioshock 2 first then play Bioshock 1 as a prequel!Because one thing that Bioshock 2 has that Bioshock 1 doesn't is Multiplayer mode. This is really fun. Ya know howModern Warfare 2was really a multiplayer game with a bonus single player campaign? Well, Bioshock 2 is a single player game with a bonus multiplayer mode. Think Modern Warfare 2 combined withWorld at War Zombie modecombined with, well, Bioshock. I tried Multiplayer last night and in my first sitting got almost all of the Trophies (for anyone that cares about that). I really bought Bioshock 2 for the single player mode. But the addition of Multiplayer only adds to the hours of good times to be had with this game. Multiplayer is an interesting story driven mode where the player takes on the role of a citizen of Rapture before the events of the first Bioshock.So is there anything bad about Bioshock 2 so far. Well, if I had to come up with something it'd be that the graphics seem to have received no upgrade whatsoever. After games like Uncharted, you'd think that 2K would have made some improvements in this department, but I'm not seeing it. The Splicers look as cartoonish as it gets. And my only other complaint would be the familiarity that Bioshock 2 has with the original. But that's the idea, right? You are \"reborn\" into Rapture.I've heard some talk about how Bioshock 2 is a carbon copy of the first game. And that talk is just ridiculous. Again, take my review for what it's worth since I'm only just getting into it. But after 6 hours I'd say that there's no question here...add this to your cart. This is a 5-star game...whether you've played the first already or not.(P.S.--I know that video game to big screen conversions mostly seem to fail, but have you heard that there's a movie adaptation of Bioshock with the28 Weeks LaterDirector at the helm?)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

Playing an rpg should feel like we are living through a novel rather than all-out shooter action or hack'n'slash. Mass Effect with its epic plot along with the tightly-knit cheographed cut-scenes, great shooter action and the actions/choices of the player directly affecting the gameplay makes Mass Effect a great sci-fi rpg. The game has been out for some time now yet the graphics and cutscenes hold quite well even today atleast on the Ultra graphical settings and almost feels like a interactive sci-fi movie. Now everyone says that Mass Effect 2 is better and improves upon Mass Effect which is something I have to see myself as I find Mass Effect almost perfect on its own and yep I even like the Mako. I am kind of bummed to hear that they have taken out Mako in the sequel as the Mako kind of gives a feel of open-endedness to the game. Mako controls are bit awkward but once you get a hang of it than it is fun running around and fighting in this armored personnel carreer and to maybe stop around, look at the scenery etc. In all Mass Effect is the trendsetting sci-fi rpg and no wonder they are making a movie out of it too.So if you are someone like me who likes sci-fi and the rpg's genre than you owe it to yourself to try Mass Effect which at its current price is a unbeatable deal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2010"}

Decision making plays a very large role in this game, and takes the idea of choosing your character's destiny to a whole new level.  Players have the ability to solve each problem in various ways.  Although the conclusion of the game is the same across each iteration, the methods in which the conclusion is reached is usually varied.Graphics (Spoilers about bonus unlocks, doesn't impact gameplay or gameplay outcome):  All I can say is wow!  After playing the game, you will start unlocking some video's that show the real faces of the actors, and thats when you really sit and take an in depth appreciation for the design of the game.  The scenery of the game, the dark, rainy atmosphere really puts you in a place where you feel that all hope is starting to fade away.  The look of the streets, and the minor details like rain drops falling from your characters nose, really put you in the game.  The movements of your characters, the agony of their face when things are going wrong, and the happiness that shines when things are going right really help you match emotions with the setting.  In all honesty, you feel the pains and triumphs of your character thanks to the realistic graphics.Sounds: The sounds of rain hitting windows, cars, the ground sound as realistic as it gets.  Voiceovers are phenominal and really match the movements of the character, as well as the change in facial structure.  There is really nothing more to say except that you will be more than pleased at the effort that was taken to achieve this.Controls: The one thing that really got me about the game is the controls.  Although most of the game requires you to press buttons in a sequence to complete actions like fighting, driving, and running away, the idea that you had to hold down R2 to walk was a pain.  This may not bother some people, but I am used to playing fps games where holding up on the joystick makes your character walk.  The clunky use of R2 while holding a direction makes it difficult to tweak where your character is standing, and at times made me accidentally walk into rooms, or people for that matter.  Other than that, the controls are really basic, and if you are an avid PS3 user, you will want to choose the highest control setting to get the full experience of the gameAge Requirement:  Here's where the player will really have to make the decision on whether this game is appropriate for others.  There is nudity in this game, although it isn't much, and no more nudity than what an R rated film would show, it is still there.  The furthest it goes is the sight of breasts, as well as the buttocks.  Also, the context of psychological disorders, and the decisions of drug use really come into play quite heavily in the game.  The game has an M rating, and should be taken into consideration before allowing those under 18 play, and watch.Replay Factor: The game's ability to control every action of your character, and the decisions that they make boost the replay factor of this game real high.  Although I played through once and was satisfied, there are many players that go back, start over, and play the game in a totally different way.  The game completely puts the steps to reach the conclusion in your hands and EVERY decision you make can impact how you get to the end.Conclusion:  This game was incredible.  I was honestly hesitant to purchase it at first, as all the hype didn't match the concept of \"crime solving\" that most reviews gave, but in all honesty I am glad I got to experience it.  You will not be dissapointed at all.  The graphics, the sound, and the interaction really make you feel, and think exactly what your character is going through, and there arent too many games that can successfully accomplish that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00D96BNGM","description":"","reviewerName":"Dmitry Kristal","summary":"Great headset after you learn the ins and outs.","reviewText":"Turtle Beach COD Ghosts &#34;Phantom&#34; is a decent addition to your gaming if you are looking for a high-end gaming headset with many options.  Out of the box, there might be a learning curve about how to set it up.  It is wireless, yes, but it does require some knowledge about what cables go where from console to the transmitter.Another thing I would like to mention is that while it does a great job delivering a 360 sound to you(if somebody shoots on your right, you will hear it louder from one speaker than the other,) this might not be an advantage to those who cannot hear well from one ear or even deaf from one of the ears.  There is no way to turn this feature off either.There are many controls on this headset --- too many actually for my taste.  There is an option that can make my voice sound like a monster or some sort of alien or what I prefer, a normal human being.  While I can see why others could find this option amusing, there is no way for me to &#34;test&#34; this feature where I can hear it before trying it.  Also if I accidentally hit it during any given moment, I will have to press the button several times before it goes back to normal.  There are also buttons and controls for sound, bluetooth sound, mute switch, bluetooth switch, mode switch, presets, mic controls and a power button.  If you can memorize where all of these switches are while playing the game, my hats off to ya!  For me, there are way too many things to memorize.  I am probably too old school, but just give me simple controls --  I wish there was a way to turn most of these options off and just allow me to control chat and game volume without much confusion.The battery for this headset is internal and can last for dozen of hours and if you are caught in a situation that the battery is running out(the voice actor will be sure to let you know,) you can connect the headset to the console and charge while playing.  Other than that, there are no wires to worry about.  There is no hiss of any kind that I have experienced which I noticed with some inferior headsets that can put you to sleep, so this is a big plus!The mic boom CAN be detached.  So the good news is that you can use it with other devices and remove the mic boom.  The bad news is of course you can lose it and those things can be pricey to replace.  The mic boom traps the sound well and will not relay too many unnecessary sounds to your chatting party amd I'll tell ya, it is very annoying to play with some people who have police sirens or barking dogs in the background, but with these, it won't happen too often, if ever.The cups are very comfy and isolate the environmental sounds around you, so you can hear the game and only the game, so if anyone in your family needs help or if its an emergency, you won't know :-/Turtle Beach COD Phantom is a great headset if you are looking for myriad of options, clear sound, comfort and wireless freedom.  If you have the patience, the funds and are a serious gamer, then this is a headset for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

Not since final fantasy 10 has a game compelled me to play it for over 100 hours. It's also the first PS3 game of the 20 or so that I own that I felt would be an insult to not get the platinum trophy.I'm going to start off by saying that this game wasn't as hard as everyone said it was. I mean yes your going to die at least 4 or 5 times per satge the first time you play it but those deaths are learning experiences and if you PAY ATTENTION you will learn and get better. Also it's impossible to beat it without a guide in my oppinion. I used a wiki guide that I found and its a favorite on my tool bar now.Theres really no story to get involved with just kill demons  and take their souls and stuff. But that also means that you can play it over and over without getting sick of it. Like the 3 times you have to beat it to get the platinum trophy. the world tendency and character tendency adds an extra level of depth as does the online which is think is what makes this game so fun.Also I think that is should be noted that even though this game is an \"rpg\" is not in the sence that you will never be uber powerfull no matter how much you level up. Even normal enemies can kill you in like 2 hits in new game+++.TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS...1. Start out as a royal class. they are balenced and start out with soul arrow which is the BEST spell in your first playthrough. I used it to kill about half of the bosses.2. Play the game in soul form ALWAYS. This means you dont have to worry about black phantoms invading(other players). You will need to equip the cling ring which is easily obtained in level 1-1. This also means your footsteps are silent so enemies can't see you as soon.3. Playing the game in soul form also means that world tendency doesn't change when you die. So all those things you heard about the gaming getting harder the more you die doesn't apply to you!4. Whenever you kill a demon and regain your body suicide in the nexus by jumping off the stairs. Make sure you don't land on any npc though, they could attack you!5. As said in 3 if you upset an npc enough they will attack you so don't swing your weapon around in the nexus. If they attack you they won't help you anymore for the rest of the game cycle.6. Once you beat level 1-1 go to level 4-1. It's got the best bow to level up and at the begining of 4-2 theres a great soul farming spot.7. Use the wiki guide it will save your SOUL!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2010"}

This is a good shooter, but not much more.  I've read so much about the RPG aspect but haven't seen much.  I put about 12 hours in, and haven't made any \"crucial\" choices that seemed to affect any outcomes.  Unless they are saving the really tough choices for the 30 hour mark, I don't get the hype.  The renegade/good decisions that pop up with R2 and L2 are pretty stupid.  You don't know what the charactor is going to do until you've pressed the button, so you're always inclined to press it just to see what happens.  Hardly a crucial decision if you ask me.My other problem is the battle system.  In the early going, I was really enjoying each fire fight, and the enemies were getting progressively more difficult.  Then I hit a point where every fight felt the same, every planet felt the same, and every conversation felt the same.  Each mission involves shooting through a seemingly unending supply of enemies until you reach the end person you're meant to speak with, then they send you on yet another mission of shoot em up.Don't get me wrong, the enemy AI can be pretty good, and I died more than I'd care to admit.  The problem I have is the repetition of it all.  There is very little exploration of planets, and it's more of \"go where this arrow tells you to go.\"  The weapons are cool, and your allies take care of business pretty well rather than the usual just get in the way type ally.  Overall, I was slightly disappointed based on the hype.  The graphics aren't anything to write home about either, but I can overlook that if the missions are more interesting.  Maybe the next installment will perfect the game, because it does have potential.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

Lets start out with some positive aspects first. The game does have a pretty good storyline. It's your average spy thriller, but does keep your interest. The ending is a little abrupt and doesn't feel like everything was adressed. Another cutscene would have helped at the end. Secondly the choices you make in the game do matter, but I find that the choice isn't very hard. Either you kill a contact or work with them. I worked with them all and got a lot of information because of it. Lastly the voice actors do a great job bringing these characters to life and are seldom monotone. Even Nolan North from \"Uncharted\" fame makes a cameo. He plays a sociopath which is far from his normal role, and is very enjoyable.Now onto the cons. Notice I mentioned nothing about the gameplay in the pro section. That's because there are none while playing the game. The aiming mechanic is the most frustrating part of the game. Your recticle is huge and very hard to hit your target. It is true that if you hold down L2 for five seconds the recticle gets smaller for a more accurate shot, but it doesn't get smaller when you move it so you have to keep it completly still for it to work. Even then a heatshot seldom kills. I advise only using an assault rifle. Its the only thing that doesn't take twenty shots to kill one enemy. Also there are no sniper rifles in the game. Actually there are two stages when you use them, but you can't take it with you.The game is also glitchy as hell. Random invisible barriers cover your targets while they shoot you to death. The cover system doesn't always work as you stand there being shot to death hoping he latches on, and sometimes you still get hit while behind cover. The gun doesn't shoot sometimes while trying to blindfire. Your enemies are dumb. Yeah the enemies won't even move when there is a grenade under their feet. Not to mention that the melee system is terrible. The martial arts skills of your attackers increases as you progress through the game, but yours don't. Also if they get a punch in, while your dazed they will shoot you in the face and kill you. That's another thing about this game that's annoying, is how fast you can be killed. One guy can kill you in one shot. The boss battles only amplify all of these flaws and you will be begging for some health. There are health stations that you can heal yourself at, but it never completly resotores your health. Which is annoying when one enemy can take all that new health away in one salvow.The RPG section of the game is a little underachieving. Yes the ranking up your character is well done, but the gun section of it is a joke. All the assault rifles are the same. They all suck so don't waste your time buying upgrades because it doesn't matter. Neither does your armor upgrades. There is an intel section of the game where you can buy specs about your next mission or answer emails. This seemed boring to me so I didn't really use it.There are little mini games to open doors, crack computers, and turn off alarms. The cracking computer part is relitvley simple as you line up text boxes. The other two are terrible and only get more difficult and frustrating the farther you get into the game.Finally let's talk about the graphics. They are terrible. There is screen tearing, textures load slow, guns are upside down in cutscenes, words seldom match the mouths of the characters, amongst other problems. The game just looks bad most of the time. Also when Thorton is killed he flys up in the air limp and blood shoots out of his body. It's laughable for the first ten times then becomes annoying. The blood looks fake as well.Overall Alpha Protocol had a decent story, but numerous game play issues kept it from being even fun. Most of the time I had to stop myself from breaking the disc in half. It's overly frustrating at times and has taken me two weeks to beat the game. Alot longer than usual for me when I get a new game simply because it annoyed me so much. If your a fan of action rpgs then wait until the price drops which shouldn't take long to pick this up. Also play on a lower difficulty and save yourself from outbursts of anger.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2010"}

It has been awhile since die hard Zelda fans have awaited to see Link's latest escapade, and how he is going to battle the force against Ganondorf. But with all that hype, there has been a lot of gamers who've still haven't mastered The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The game which was a part of the Nintendo Wii's launch back in 2006, is honestly one of the most epic games die hard Zelda fans and Link heads have loved to play. Now it is back at a lower price, and still is worth the money.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess brings out the action and fierceness as Link goes head to head, trying to battle the madness Ganondorf and his band of foes including a fire-breathing armoroed dragon, the paranoid King Zant, and the heart of Hyrule in a battle between good and bad. Along the way, Link will be possessed by a wolf spirit which will transform him into a wolf who is fierce and howls at the moon with the deepest might, all trying to save Hyrule. Along the way, he'll meet Midna, who helps him along the quest, and helps to merge the shadow world, and Hyrule from the depths of despair, also trying to get Midna back to her own world. The gameplay is fierce, and has so many challenges to master from swordfights and jousts, to puzzles and mind-blowing quests. Along the way, you'll also use weapons of aid from slingshots, and grappling hooks, to the use of iron boots which will help you walk on the watery floor. It really is a great quest that is truly epic to what The Legend had brought in for gamers for a quarter of a century. The control with the Wii takes a bit to get used to, compared to how Zelda fans have mastered it with the classic Gamecube and Nintendo 64 controls, while the music is still just as epic to why The Legend Of Zelda has shown to be as strong as the tri-force.With also the hype Nintendo has with a new system for gamer awaiting in the wings next year, and at a lower price for the Wii, now is absolutely a great time to buy The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It really is a epic game that is still just as masterful as why Link has been so epic all this time. When it has came down to The Legend Of Zelda: Twlight Princess, it has been one of the most exciting and challenging games Nintendo has ever made. It still was sadly overlooked in favor of the classic Wii Sports, and other Wii favorites like Super Mario Galaxy over the years, but is definitely worth the fight. I loved playing The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess when it came out nearly 5 years ago, and it definitely is worth taking the trip down Wii memory lane. While Wii gamers are anxiously awaiting Skyward Sword, they should give The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess a whirl if they have just bought the Nintendo Wii.Graphics: BSound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

Here's the deal, it is definitely fun. I know people have talked about lots of problems , i have had none, maybe the new dlc improved the things that didn't work well. This game is different than most multilayer type of games, it is a bit more complex for 1 thing but not that bad. I was afraid there wouldn't be a lot to do. There is a lot . First you can do the challenges. You can play the campaign on your own, or go back and compete against others. The bots seem to be really quite good, so playing on your own is actually quite fun but a bit too easy on normal to me. There are messages to get that explain the story, i recommend that you do the campaign on own to get the story, if you play competitively you will need to go back to understand what's going on. The graphics in the game are okay, nothing close to crisis 2 for example. The parkour is fun, but could have been better. One additional button command would have made it really good. I do not like that you just push one button and you go where you want, you should have to do a timing jump or something like in mirror's edge.Other complaint is i wished people played campaign online as well and not just the competition mode. Anyway, game is really good and would be better if more people would play.The free dlc has really improved this game. For the price its a good buy.I will update in a few days.IUpdate: This game is better than I thought.What a shame more people haven't given it either the time or they listened to the critics . I am certain critics didn't put enough time into game to really get it figured out.This is by far the best multiplayer game I have played. Much better than the CODS, killzones or crisis. The solo or multiplayer aspects of the game are really quite different. I will for sure put many, many more hours in game. Replay is off the charts.If you play do resistance first. Its a lot easier. Mission 6 for fortress is way harder than the other missions, I got thru it as an engineer setting up a turret. I played this mission on easy and it was tough. In summary, give game another look, it does take some time because there is a lot going on. Also the DLC has added a lot to the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005UK88","description":"Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2boasts all 96 levels from the original Super NES game, from cheery Yoshi's Island through the sprawling Vanilla Dome to the grueling Star Road. While some levels emphasize pure action, others require you to puzzle your way out of the mazes and illusions. If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.","reviewerName":"Ryan Bancroft","summary":"Continue the remakes, Nintendo.","reviewText":"If nintendo can bring themselves to keep releasing past greats, they will continue to reign supreme in the handheld market.  Almost nothing can compare to nintendo's brilliant oldies, and Super Mario World is probably one of the most fondly remembered.  Not only did it introduce the platform genre to the 16-bit masses, but it defined what makes platformers fun--excitement, challenge, mental puzzles, and, of course, secrets, of which Mario was not at all lacking.  With an-unprecedented-for-the-time 96 levels, heck even unprecedented now!, Mario exhibited an incredible amount of playability, not to mention replay value.From the Butter Bridge secrets, to the 5 star road entrances, to the fan favorite Special secret area that offers an impressive reflexive challenge, Super Mario World is a past-livers dream, though doesn't alienate the future crop of gamers--offering numerous pangs of enjoyment for gamers of today.If you want a lesson in or reliving of old game design, a design still scarcely matched, and quite fun at that, then Super Mario World for the Gameboy Advance is your best bet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2002"}

I got it the day it came out because of the movie and for some reason I thought Christian Bale was going to be in it. Turned out he's not. :(Anyway, back to the game itself. The game is pretty easy and when it comes to achievements there are only 11 achievements to be earned, with each achievement giving you 80 points. 9 of them you can get by just playing in the easy mode which I did with my 8 year old son and we both beat the game playing co-op in a about 3 hours. The other 2 you would have beat the entire game on medium and hard difficulty.The story line is based on John Connor the savior of mankind going to save a few of his buddies that are behind enemy lines. Along the way you meet a couple of other agents that tag along with you. It's basically a shoot at the machines kind of game. It certainly ain't no Gears of War. Pretty tame stuff if GOW is your thing.The graphics also could have been better. I expected better from a 360 game. The cut scenes aren't that great and the acting isn't either and the worst news is that there is no online co-op. It's a good thing Amazon has it at the price it is because it surely isn't worth the suggested retail.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2009"}

It took me a long time looking at the specs and capabilities before finally deciding on the PS3 and so far Ive not been disappointed.Physically the PS3 has an elegant appearance and looks right at home with my hifi setup. I actually thought it looked a bit odd and \"curvy\" at first but I am starting to really dig the design and features eg. touch sensitive buttons, slot loading drive and cool blue and green leds. Plus it runs very quiet which is great for home theater. The controller is the familiar Playstation design and very lightweight, love the fact that its bluetooth and you can even charge it through the USB on your PC.Moving on to the daily use of the system is where it starts to impress. Everything from the beep you get when you power on the system, to the GUI and menus feels like you are operating a powerful machine and not a toy. On the features side it plays practically everything eg. Blu-ray, upscaling DVDs, Divx and XviDs. Streaming 1080p mkv and flac files with PS3 Media Streamer is probably one of the coolest features. High bitrate playback stutters on wireless for me but is rock solid on a wired connection. Also look into an app called mkv2go if you prefer a more traditional method of transferring your media eg. usb flash drives and discs.Of course the PS3 is a gaming machine and a damn good one at that! One of my favorite features are the free game demos, as well as 1080p Blu-ray trailers. A sort of try before you buy which has helped me decide which titles to get and saved me some money. Graphically these new generation of games are incredible and the game selection is very good so far. Here are few titles to me are must buy if you get a PS3.Resident Evil 5Grand Theft Auto IVStreet Fighter IVTomb Raider: UnderworldRatchet & Clank Future: Tools of DestructionNBA 2K9Top Spin 3On a side note they also have Super Puzzle Fighter as a $10 download which was a huge plus for me.From a PC gamers perspective, the mouse and keyboard is still king for FPS but I think the PS3 does everything else better (sports, platformers and sandbox games). A very nice addition to FPS gaming on a PC. You'd be surprised on how much more relaxed gaming with a controller is and fun you can have with a PS3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2009"}

With this installed, the graphics are absolutely beautiful.This game looks and feels great and will be immediately familiar to anyone who has played the previous Splinter Cell games.  The same stealth-based combat and gadgets are in play as usual, but they feel fresh and are wonderfully executed.  I can say that there is a small problem with the cover system (in my opinion only) in that you can come unglued from cover a bit easier than I would like and it is sometimes clunky moving from one cover location to another.  I have been able to get used to the way it works and have just had to slow down more than I expected in order to stay in cover.The computer AI is not amazingly smart, so you will find that the enemy follows patterns that you can figure out, thus helping you finish levels in a stealthy manner.  I don't mind this, but it would be nice to have the AI be less pattern oriented.  With this in mind, it still plays exactly as you would expect from a Splinter Cell game and I can't really complain.The story is compelling and the game works very well as a vehicle to tell that story.  There are some very cinematic moments and the fact that you MUST be stealthy instead of simply running and gunning makes you feel much more connected to the story.  This is the way this kind of game should work and Splinter Cell: Blacklist delivers.I would give the game about a 9 to a 9.25 out of 10.  It is really a great story with excellent mechanics, graphics, and, most importantly, gameplay.Bottom line: Highly recommended - buy it.4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

You fight, gain command posts, and have fun, its not complicated! Some would argue differently, but this is the best Battlefront title ever created (blows the portable renegade and elite squadron games out of the water, never understood why lucasarts did so poorly with those)Anyway, if you heard the news, Battlefront 3 was cancelled around 2008, and lucasarts was shut down by Disney just a few months ago. A new Hope(SW reference yay!) has risen as EA bought the liscenses to the star wars games. Even better, about a month ago, DICE(battlefield,Mirror's Edge) has announced a NEW battlefront title at E3. Back to battlefront 2- i believe there is no star wars battlefront 'type' game that can top this, but i have high hopes for this new Star Wars Battlefront.

{"product_name":"B00006Z7HR","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Pretty good overall","reviewText":"The GamePro School of RPG Design offers three tenets that all sequels should adhere to: One, the new game should be original; two, it should expand on the series' strong points; and three, it should fix or remove any annoying bits the original suffered from. Dark Cloud 2, the sequel to Sony's innovative yet maddeningly dull action/RPG, follows all three rules to the letter. Sniff. It's so rewarding to see such apt pupils.Dark Cloud 2's core is much like the original's-Max and Monica prowl through random dungeons, discovering magic stones that serve as fuel for their side business of rebuilding villages. The chief new feature is Max's invention skill: You can take photos of nearly everything in the game and combine them to come up with new weapons and such. Is this game better than the last one? Well, it certainly looks better: The cel-a-delic characters are beautiful in motion, and the backdrops combine with the soundtrack to create this sort of homespun, European-countryside atmosphere for which RPG nuts will go weak in the knees. The control scheme is also completely stress-free, despite all the buttons it uses, and in-game help videos cover any sticky points. Most importantly-and this will make Dark Cloud fans very happy-Level-5 has fixed nearly everything wrong with the first game. You don't have to feed water to your party all the time; there are only two characters instead of five, so you're not wasting time raising useless party members; and each dungeon has several optional objectives, from time attacks to fishing to even an odd version of golf, so the endless fighting in the original is also gone forever. It still ain't perfect (the translation's off in spots, and finding HP/defense upgrades for Max and Monica is unfairly challenging), but it's close enough. Dark Cloud 2 is an excellent game in its own right, and it deserves far more than the dreaded &quot;something to tide you over until Zelda&quot; stigma.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2003"}

It seems that this game is the newest release by the company CryTech.  You may recall a previous title by the name Far Cry, yeah same people.  Crysis makes use of a new gaming engine (CryEngine 2) and is one of the new \"Next Gen\" games available for both XP and Vista and blah blah blah.  Essentially, you can count on it to put your video card in a hammerlock and clock you processor to next week as you play.  From what I have seen, this game is built for platforms which may not even exist yet.  Not to say that you can't play it on a less than brand new machine, you simply may not enjoy it as much.  For reference, I played through with a Intel Core Duo 2.4, Nvidia 8800 GTS and 2 gigs of ram, without any problems.The game itself is great.  Set in the not so distant future (2020) you are a special ops soldier sent into an island somewhere in the south China sea.  Originally sent to fight Koreans and rescue some scientists, things get very odd very fast.  For more plot check out Wikipedia, but let me assure you it is far more gratifying than the plot of most shooters out there (namely Timeshift).The interface of the game works well.  I didn't have to play with a single config, control or setting throughout the entire game.  I find it is always nice to find my buttons, video and sound settings right where I need them from the start.The only real concept that causes this game to differ from others is the use of the nanosuit.  Essentially, it is a set of superpowered battle armor you get the joy of using.  For short intervals, it can cloak you, speed you up, give you super strength or simply defend you.  This sounded cool from the start, but quickly degenerated into using the same function over and over again as the difficulty of your enemy is amped up to compensate for you powers.Example: I decide to give myself a bit of super strength to rush up and pound some poor sap into the ground.  Result:  I am blasted to death before I make it five feet or I find that I am trying to fight the loosing side of a brawl between Halle Berry and a bull elephant.  So scratch that power for any reason other than jumping really high.I was pretty much stuck cloaking myself, running until my battery went dead, then hiding and recharging.  This process is repeated until you get  close enough to actually hit someone with that wildly gyrating rifle you have been trying to aim for the last hour.This was my experience on normal skill, which oscillated from pointlessly easy to total unthinking rage against all living things.  I would assume that things get only worse on hard, your enemies also stop speaking English on hard for some reason.  So, if you are worried about playing an unbalanced game, stop there.  This game is nicely balanced against you in every way.  Recoil makes any rapid fire attempt laughable and a \"realistic\" figure 8 sway pattern makes timing a sniper shot a minigame all in its own.The only shortcoming I had with this game was the length (about 10 hours give or take 2 depending on your anger threshold).  Now I understand it is the new thing for developers to get lazy and release games in episodes in order to guarantee future income as well as cut down on development costs (just release the second half years later and call it Episode 2, stupid Valve) but I am getting really tired of paying for demos.Overall, I have to give this game good ratings.  It plays nicely, it keeps you interested and it looks amazing.  But after reaching the end you are left flailing in confusion as to what the heck ever happened to the idea of a conclusion.  I notice that CryTech has plans for a FarCry 2 but I haven't heard anything for a Crysis 2 yet so it may be a while before anyone gets closure.  Great, all of a month after release and I am yelling for a sequel, or at least the second half of my game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2007"}

The character designs are very sugary sweet, accompanied by high-pitched voices that you want to slap in the face (Pipsy, I'm looking at you). Bright, cheerful colors, bright cheerful soundtrack. Yeah, kids love this stuff.But strip all that away, and this is a very well-designed and challenging cart racer. It kind of does the opposite of Mario Kart 64, and offers a strong single-player mode and a fun but somewhat bare multiplayer-mode. Similiar to platform games, you race through courses and collect balloons, which in turn open boss fights and other worlds with more courses. There are three fully-tuned vehicles to choose from: your kart, a plane, and a hovercraft. Each has it's pros and cons, controls differently from the others, and takes skill to master. You can even race different vehicles against each other, often taking different routes in the same course. Like other kart racers this one isn't about speed, but the tracks have lots of detail and animation, and are consistently interesting to race through (one even looks like the Death Star trench from Star Wars).Where the game starts to frustrate is Rareware's typical way of extending play time. Beat the courses once, then race through them again and collect 8 hard-to-reach coins while still maintaing first place. This leads to a harder boss encounter, and must be done to unlock the final levels and the best ending. Little kids will probably throw the controller down right here, but anyone who's worth anything in video games will find it immensely satisfying to clear Rare's requirements and unlock all that the game has to offer. Seperates the men from the boys, and all that.If Rareware hadn't made the characters so sugary, this could've easily topped Mario Kart 64 in recognition among the older crowd. Definitely worth a purchase used, and good luck to all those up for the challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2006"}

{"product_name":"B005J5K9UW","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Turn the brain off...this was meant to be idiotic fun....","reviewText":"Ohhh, where to start?Lollipop Chainsaw is a guilty pleasure, an indulgence, a true descent into idiotic debauchery.  The game features Juliet, a chainsaw-wielding cheeleader of San Romero High who has a GPA of 3.4.  Her big \"secret\" is that she comes from a family of zombie hunters and as things inexpelicably start to go zombified in her quaint little town turned upside down, she shows us that her trusty blinged-up chainsaw is never far away (in her backpack?!?).Her boyfriend, Nick (GPA 2.7), is bitten by a zombie that he tries to fend off from Juliet.  Juliet, of course, performs some quite necessary surgery (read \"decapitation\") and magic to ensure that Nick's head is not zombified...or, in the game's parlance, isn't infected while the rest of his body succumbs to viral zombie onslaught.How does the gameplay fare?  Well, if you're into God of War combos, then Lollipop Chainsaw might be right up your alley.  Juliet utilizes a series of martial art/\"cheer\"-type moves to wear zombies down.  Once zombies get groggy, they can be decapitated immediately.  Or, alternately, you can mix it up with the slower chainsaw attacks...or a combination of both.  Killing zombies awards you coins to purchase move upgrades, concept art, health increases, recovery time decreases, etc. at Chop Shop boutiques scattered throughout the levels.  Portions of levels are destructable, including classroom lockers which contain coins as well.  Zombies range from the typical cannon-fodder fare to the more difficult zombies populated by teachers, police offices (w/ guns!!!), etc.  The various moves that you can purchase range from lengthier chains in your cheer combos or a cheer/chainsaw combo that results in Juliet spearing her enemies dead center.  Some of the familiar grind that some platformers put you through are interrupted with various level challenges in Lollipop, including a challenge that puts Juliet in a basketball court with the challenge of scoring more than 100 points in under 3 minutes from 2- and 3-point shots with decapitated zombie heads.  There are various, other mini-game challenges throughout including ones that place Nick's head on decapitated zombies temporarily to perform feats of strength by using context-sensitive cheer moves to keep his zombie body in motion.Graphically, Lollipop Chainsaw is candy.  The art style is very reminiscent of comic book art with great cel-painted, girlish colors and some of the cutscenes in between (including a hilarious prologue showing her family, including her father, who some of her friends describe as a DILF) feature actual comic book art.  Combat is pretty fluid and the acrobatic progression through some of her combos is pretty well-done.  One might argue that it's choppy, but the pauses are actually there to punctuate the graphical blows and death-dealing that Juliet is bestowing upon her foes.Overall, this is a guilty pleasure not to be viewed with any intelligence or morals whatsoever.  It gets a mature rating for good reason from language, brutal violence, sexual dialogue, etc.  It's everything that your mother doesn't want your kids to play...and probably doesn't want you to play either, regardless of your age.  :)  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Fred","summary":"Bought it for 4 systems now","reviewText":"well, I never had the Wii but just bought the Wii U so I'll get to play it with the motion shooting controls that they didn't include for the upscaled PS3 version for some reason using the MOVE controller. So I'm pretty sure I'll like this when I get it same game that I bought on Gamecube, PS2, PS3 but with the added Wii motion based shooting controls. I don't expect the graphics to be much different than the original Gamecube or PS2 versions. But that's the thing, I repeat again I don't know why Capcom didn't offer the MOVE controller for the HD version on PS3, they just have no love or caring for helping Sony gaming out.Anyway, the game is stellar. Challenging horrifying action, great level design and variety...erie soundtrack and insane boss battles. There are some great unlock items but I don't know if anything was different for the Wii, so I'll find out when I get it this week. On the PS3 HD version(i bought the Asia version from PlayAsia on disc) I unlocked everything except collection all the bottle caps? whatever...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2014"}

BANGSNOT \"C.G.\"","summary":"Same Problems as Other PS2 Era Franchises Transitioning to PS3","reviewText":"The Hitman series gained popularity in the Playstation 2 era. Hitman Absolution is the first Hitman title for the PS3. Inexplicably, it does what so many other franchises are guilty of in their transition to Playstation 3. It tries to re-invet the wheel, creating bigger worlds,  and prettier graphics,  but screwing up the  very basic, bare essentials needed to make a game playable.I'm talking about things like... saving your progress.The previous hitman titles allowed you to save your progress just before trying something crazy... and if things went South, you could begin again right from where you were.  And you had a choice of where to save it. Hitman: Absolution has a series of \"checkpoints,\" that will save your current position. But the checkpoints are fixed and do not allow you to save progress at a time of your own choosing.  And if you turn the  game off, you will not re-spawn at that checkpoint when you turn it back on.But worst of all, this game has a bug that wiped out all of my progress.This is the second PS3 title with which I've had this problem.It completely- COMPLETELY RUINS  the experience.Game developers seem to be concentrating too much on making the games bigger and prettier for the PS3, but scrapping the elements needed for  basic functionality.I've lost all of my progress and don't care to start over from the beginning.WARM AND FUZZY ASSASSINAmong game developers, there seems to be a weird tendency to add emotional, heart- tugging elements to franchises where it previously did not exist and quite frankly, doesn't fit.Agent 47 shows affection for Diana and spends most of the game protecting Diana's daughter from harm. It doesn't add depth, it doesn't add to the story- it's just weird and seems to be part of some fad.Have the emo kids all grown up and become game developers and taken total control of the gaming industry?Agent 47 is infinitely more fun as an unscrupulous, cold- blooded assassin.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2013"}

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Deimos \".\"","summary":"Very, very nice game.","reviewText":"I love fighting games.  MKA on the WII was awesome and in my view the best version of the game with the most fighters.  Once again I belive Wii has the best version of this great game.  Anyone growing up in the NES era would have given anything for an awesome game like this.  All we got was the horrid Godzilla and Godzilla II and more horrid games to follow.  Finally after all this time we have Godzilla DAM on GC and this gem on wii.  The monsters and arena's are awesome, the moves are great, the controls are quite good, the destruction is second to none, the graphics are spot on and the action is great.  The is a very enjoyable game on all fronts for any Godzilla or fighting game fan.  Forget MK vs DC garbage games and get this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Best of the Need for Speed series by far","reviewText":"This has to be one of the best current racing games to date.  I enjoy the social competition feature in this game, whereas you are constantly alerted if someone beats your recent time in an event. It gives you focus to do better next time. This game is nearly perfect, although I do have a few gripes, mainly concerning the cop mode.Regarding cops:-No double or triple takedowns, like in Burnout 3.-When you take down a racer, you are placed wherever the game seems appropriate.Overall, it is a fantastic game, one of the best this generation. The challenges in the game are sufficiently hard to challenge you, and the AI is fantastic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}
