{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

As in most of these RPGs, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, personalities and motivations.You begin as the swordsman, a member of the guard of the Queen's army. Enemies are attacking and you head out to cleanse your land of the enemies. Soon enough you have all four party members on board, and are gaining experience, finding loot, and improving your skills, weapons and armor.Gameplay is very much like most other RPGs on the market. You have a large world that you explore bit by bit. When you get near enemies, you button-mash to create combos and earn experience. As you explore the lands, you bash urns and break into chests to steal the treasures of your villagers.While combat is fast and furious, the rest the game can be very slow paced. There are very long cut scenes in this game to draw you into the story. Be prepared with your favorite food and drink to keep yourself busy while these scenes drag on. The people you speak to each have one or two key phrases and simply repeat them over and over again.The graphics are very nice in a Final Fantasy sort of way - a detailed, cartooney fantasy world of big castles and peaceful villages. On the other hand, you're sort of moving from 'painting' to 'painting' much of the time, which can be frustrating and feel like you're being led by the nose through the plot.On the true downside, the female characters appear to enjoy wearing the skimpiest of bikinis into brutal combat with a lot of blood and gore. This earns the game its mature rating. It's certainly great to have female party members in a game - it wasn't very long ago that adventure games solely featured male characters. But do they have to all look like prostitues??The sound is reasonably nice, with music that helps to convey the feeling of the scenes.In general, the game is a fun introduction to how RPGs work, but with the game being so linear, there isn't much decision making in the game. And with the game only lasting maybe a week or two of average game playing time, it is over very quickly. So those who would best benefit from this type of 'intro' RPG - i.e. young kids and tweens - can't buy it because of its mature rating.If I were the maker, I would have toned back the blood and skin to earn the game a more kid-friendly rating, which would have made the game well suited to its target audience. As it is, only adults who are just learning about RPGs will really appreciate what this game has to offer. The rest of us will zip through it pretty quickly and be left wanting something a bit more meaty.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2004"}

The handwriting recognition works just well enough to make the game enjoyable and challenging.

A difference of even one second makes all the difference in your score. I must admit the frustration level reaches a high level when a score is substantially reduced only because the handwriting recognition misconstrues say \"4\" as a \"21\".I have some doubts whether this game makes a person more mentally acute.

{"product_name":"B000RZPW9W","reviewerName":"Schwe1nehund","summary":"Terrific","reviewText":"I picked it up 3 weeks ago and am currently a level 35 Cimmerian Conqueror. I checked it out at a buddy's place when the game launched and although I was impressed by some things, the numerous issues/bugs kept me away. I wasn't going to shell out 50 bucks and a 15 dollar monthly fee - even though I wanted to bodily fling myself at the game.Totally different story now. Seriously, AoC has been improved DRAMATICALLY since launch. You just need to be patient for it to go through some collossal updates. Although Funcom can be blamed for not ensuring the current level of quality at launch, I give them kudos for actually fixing the issues and adding new stuff. There can be some minor nuisances here and there but nothing that'll bring the gaming experience to a screeching halt.I've long been an avid Conan fan and as such I appreciate the faithful recreation of Hyboria - at least the three regions we are exposed to (Cimmeria, Aquilonia and Stygia). A large part of that is because of the art direction and the game engine (which is the best amongst MMORPGs at the moment - Godrays in DX10 FTW). But other details like the top notch voice acting only make Hyboria more alive. Accents are well played and plausible, given the setting. Minor gripe, but once you leave Tortage, where you'll likely spend the first 20 or so levels, NPCs become mute for the most part (about 1 in every 10 or 15 will actually speak). Musical score is spot-on and well paced.Combat mechanics are awesome! Its actually engaging and more than just click and sit back. You have to carefully observe the enemy for openings (non-shielded areas) to execute some pretty brutal yet satisfying finishing moves. I was blindly button mashing at first until I realized that there was really an art to executing the fatalities. I for one, like something where real-time skill is required as much as stats.Multiplayer is a blast. I've had the pleasure of playing with very nice and helpful people so far - but then again my experience is restricted to a PVE server. I have heard of at least one PVP server which is chock full of douchebags. Haven't leveled up high enough to get into the real siege battles but some of the folks i chatted with speak highly of it - a couple of them came back after trying out a year ago and they have been nothing but full of praise for the improvements.Just to demonstrate Funcom's dedication to bringing the world of Conan to the masses, I have to mention that the not-so-subtle homage to H.P. Lovecraft brought a smile to my face. Keep an out for it in Stygia. For the uninitiated, this is fun because Conan's creator Robert E. Howard was actually influenced, to some extent by his friend H.P. Lovecraft.All in all its a remarkable buy. I know FunCom's made some mistakes in the past and they almost sound desperate what with free 2 week reactivations for old players (think that expires on July 22nd '09) but its a good marketing effort. The game is NOT what it was at launch. It took them a year but they nailed it. Looking forward to the expansion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

The fighters are balanced a lot better and the additional characters add a lot to the game. I also love the new backgrounds which are a LOT better than the old ones. Some of the voice acting is still terrible though. Particularly Dee Jay. Some of the story lines are beyond horrible. They must have put all of 3 seconds on coming up with these stories. The anime endings are still awful. I don't know why they just didn't use the ingame graphics like they do when you meet your rival which is a lot more enjoyable than the ends are.

Even when I do make it through a round or two, if/when the game does crash, I lose all progress from that sequence of matches. I have ranked up multiple times in a few matches and had this all erased many times. Single player is no exception. I played the first mission, no problem. First 5 minutes of second mission...

The game is so incredible in the amount of variety it offers (both in unique and interesting levels, as well as new and exciting ways to take people out) it could have almost been split up into two titles and still be worth the price. I don't want to provide any level-specific spoilers at all, but let me just say if you completely finish this game without finding one level you absolutely loved, you simply don't like this entire genre of gaming!Although this game has absolutely no multiplayer component, I could easily see a group of people gathered around the TV with pizza and beer as you take turns trying to accomplish the best or wildest \"hit.\"The controls in this game are sometimes difficult. Overall, you spend most of your time picking a weapon, then using it. However, when you have to make accident kills, specifically throwing someone over the side of a building, boat railing or cliff, you'll find that it doesn't always work. This is particularly true at the higher levels, where making these accidents happen is essential for earning the coveted \"Silent Assassin\" rating.Speaking of which -and mostly specific to the Xbox 360 version- the achievements for this game are somewhat ambiguous. One example is that the requirements for earning a Silent Assassin rating on the \"Pro\" level is different than earning it on the lower difficulty levels, but you're never informed of the differences, or how to achieve it in the first place. Likewise, the \"Special Rating\" achievement is only really possible to earn by accident, or after researching how to do so on the game forums. All of this is troubling, since the point of the game is to become the ultimate hitman. And when they won't tell you how to do so, you'll feel a little cheated.Obviously, there are some adult themes in this game. In addition to the gratuitous (but fun!) violence, there are also numerous sexual scenarios. There isn't a lot of foul language (at least that I noticed, but I'm also pretty liberal on that), but parents should certainly review this title closely before purchasing it for a minor.All said, this game easily earns a 5-star rating for the replayability, level design and massive options for interesting deaths. The only problems with this game (which lowered my \"overall rating\" by one star) are the sometimes troubling controls and the lack of information on how to \"do your best\" as a hitman. However, the casual gamer won't care about these inadequacies and the hardcore gamers will find ways around them.

Bad Company 2, the latest and greatest offering of the Battlefield series has set the bar higher for first person tactical shooters. Expanding on Bad Company, this game has addressed many issues of that game with the results being a fluid playing game that is like no other. Let me go over the game features:Modes -Regular - Team kill off (you can still kill by collapsing a building), radar, enemy ID, less bullet damage, HUD type cross hair, ammo indicatorHard - Team Kill on, no HUD cross hairs, no ammo indicator, no radar, enemies can be called out but need to go into menu to see map, much more weapon damage ie you can shoot down helicopters with enough small arm fire.Graphics- As good as any Shooter on the MarketDestructive Environment - Its a major part of the fun of the Bad Company games, based on the DICE engine.Game Play- Realistic battle mayhem with all the explosions, cursing, destruction and carnageTeam Play - Based on 4 man squads. You can invite or find your friends easily. You can even, with a minimum of 8 of your friends (4v4), get your own private room.Online Classes - Assault/ammo resupply, Engineer/mechanic, Medic/health/revival, Recon/motion sensorCommunication - Open mic and you can only talk with your squad.HOWEVER, in Bad COmpany 2, the SELECT button is your friend. Need some health? Find a medic on your team (but not on your squad), put him in your cross hairs and hit select. Your character will ask him for health. Same works for if you need ammo or your vehicle repaired. You can also order (well suggest, lol) that your squad attacks or defends a key position with the select button. And you can highlight enemies in regular mode using the select button. And when someone attacks or defends the objective you highlighted or kills the enemies you highlighted, you get points. Unfortunately, the game ships with the Russians defaulting to speaking in Russian. You can change that in the game options, opting for the Russians to speak English with a Russian Accent.Audio - Dolby Digital adds incredible realism. Multiple output optimizations for hi-fi, headphones, etc..Controls- The most logical outlay of all the shooter games I have played (SOCOM, COD, BF1, etc..)which makes it play fluid.Weapons - A vast assortment of weapons, with achievement points given at milestones (number of kills).Vehicles - Tanks, check. Helicopters, check. Armored Vehicles, check. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, check. Jeeps and armored cars, check. ATVs, Patrol Boats and Jet Skis, check , check and check! For the most part, they are easy to use and have the option of first or third person. The helicopter is the hardest to master, but if you try to keep it high enough and simply steer it you will do fine.Solo Offline Game Play- An intense, at times, mission that will take you all over the world with the 3 characters from the first Bad Company game. There is less goofing off in this game, but it still has fun moments.Trophies - Many for both on and offline accomplishments.Brief Overview of Online Game ModesRush- formerly Gold Rush in Bad Company 1. Up to 3 4-man squads on a team. You will be assigned to either attack or defend 2 objectives in a series of of up to 5 bases. The attackers have 75 respawn lives (tickets) to blow up the 2 crates. If the attackers use all their tickets up, without blowing both boxes at any of the 5 bases, the defenders win. If the attackers blow up both boxes before using up their tickets, there will be a lull for about a minute to give the defenders a chance to set up defenses and then next base opens up to the attackers. The number of tickets resets to 75 and the process repeats until all the bases are taken, up to 5, to win the game. The Crates are very sturdy and can be destroyed by setting the charge on the latch (easiest) or inflicting damage to the crate by either lots of small arms fire (40mm grenades or RPGs), fire from an armored vehicle, C4 charges or destruction of the building its in.Squad Rush - Similar to Rush, but only 8 players total (4v4). Instead of 2 crates, there is only 1 and there is only a couple of bases, not 4 or 5.Conquest Mode - Similar to Domination in COD:MW2. You have to hold the majority of the spawn areas for a majority of the time.Squad Death Match - 1 4-man squad vs 3 other squads. Teamwork and communication is key for survival winning it seems in this mode more then the others since every squad is down 3 to 1.Online there is a ranking system and you have to earn your weapons and upgrades through how well you play and your kills. You are given a Combat Rating of up to 201. Only 1 person has that rating, the one currently playing better then anyone in the game. Lots of things besides kills or kill/death ratios go into Combat Ratings. Team play also goes into it, giving ammo and health to squad and team mates and playing smart, staying alive.When you hit the officer ranks, the amount of points needed to rank up goes way up and continues to go in between each rank. By the time you are an officer, you will have most of your weapons and upgrades, called specializations. This is not a game you will shot to the top rank in a week or two or even a month or two.This game isn't perfect. But its close. EA and DICE did a great job and are providing excellent support for the couple of bugs that have unexpectedly shown up. Also, DLC has already been released, free for those with the VIP version. More DLC is on the way, in the forms of uniforms, trophies and new game play modes on existing maps. Great Job DICE!Most of the frustration I, and many, have about this game is with squad and teammates. A balanced squad will beat a squad with 3 or 4 snipers almost every time in most situations. Many seemed confused as to the objective of the game and just sit in a corner sniping targets with no regard to objectives. In that light, the Recon class is the least helpful class in the game and puzzles some as to why its even included. The other classes can give some type of aid to their teammates directly. The only thing a sniper can do is throw a short lived motion sensor. And they can call in mortar strikes, probably a big lure for the class, but in most cases its done ineffectively or can harm the team by destroying the building the crate your team is defending is in along with team killing even on regular mode which has team kill turned off. I saw a review today where it was speculated the class is for those that don't like close combat. In any case, if you find yourself on a squad loaded with snipers, try talking some sense into their heads or if that fails, leave because your teammates are IMO more into personal stats then team goals or just don't get the game. Don't let this discourage you from buying this game though. All games have issues, problems or bugs. And this game has way too much going for it not to get it if this is the type of game you enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

Depending on how many stars you hit, you're awarded a star score at the end of each song, showing you how well you performed. Sadly, the game isn't great at recognizing your movements, and you often encounter moments of frustration as you wonder why you're not being scored correctly. However, this isn't too significant when you're performing because no matter how few points you get, it's impossible to fail out of a song.This can be quite beneficial because the choreography is very difficult. Most routines are based on those in Michael's music videos, with a few original creations inspired by his dancing thrown in too. Signature moves, such as high kicks, toe stands, and moonwalks, all make an appearance and are extremely tricky to replicate if you're not blessed with Michael's skills. You do have the option of performing as one of the backing dancers, who have less-complicated moves, but this is only available on a limited number of tracks. Despite the difficulty, songs are a blast to perform, with the famous routines from \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", and \"Billie Jean\" particular highlights. Playing with friends just adds to the fun because it's hilarious to watch them take part, and friends sitting it out can sing along with the lyrics displayed onscreen. Fans will be pleased to see most of his celebrated back catalogue in the game, including songs from his Motown days, such as \"Rock With You\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.\" From the '80s, \"Bad\" and \"Smooth Criminal\" are available, as well as more recent songs, such as \"Ghost\" and \"Money.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are. This minor flaw doesn't detract from the  game's excellent value, though.Sonic Advanceoffers a very good  single-player game and some of the best link options of any GBA title.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"THE OPPOSITE OF FINAL FANTASY 12","reviewText":"When I reviewed FINAL FANTASY 12, I praised its refreshing battle system and frowned on its poor characters, music and storyline. LOST ODYSSEY as we will see, is the complete opposite--but does that mean that one is better than the other?BATTLE SYSTEM: 4/5 -- Unlike FF12, this game uses the turn-based combat system found on many an RPG. However, extra damage can be dealt by timing the overlapping of two \"Rings\". Very repetitive, but much more sensible than the mindless button-mashing of FINAL FANTASY 8. Immortal characters can only learn new skills by \"Linking\" with mortal characters, which I thought was a good idea as it forces you to rotate your formation and try new strategies. Finally, there are \"Walls\" based on the strength of your front row of characters, that help defend your weaker characters.TRANSPORTATION: 4/5 -- Anyone who has played the earlier FINAL FANTASY games knows that the AIRSHIP was the ultimate, most fun way to get around the world and it often featured the best \"theme music\". Sadly, from FINAL FANTASY 10 on, the airship failed to make an appearance as a controllable vehicle. THANKFULLY, in this game, you get to control a Speed Boat, a huge Cruise Ship, and a Ship that can operate on the water, under the seas, and flying in the air! Not as fun as the previous airships, but still very enjoyable. The \"theme\" song is not too bad, either.STORYLINE: 4/5 -- Playing LO makes me realize how much they skimped on the storyline in FF12. Any good RPG should feel like you're interacting with a 1,000 page fantasy/SF novel and LO does this extremely well. The storyline is very easy to follow while still being very complex and leaving lots that can be explored in future installments in this series (hopefully). The dream narratives range from cheesy to powerful, but for the most part are very well written.CHARACTERS: 4/5 -- The characters in LO are really unique, each with their own personalities and back-stories. Some, like Jansen, are a bit odd, but at least he's consistently so. There were countless times I cracked up at Jansen's remarks--something that I never experienced with any of the characters in FF12.SOUND: 4/5 -- Sound effects are pretty much average, but the voice acting is really good as the characters match up with their given voices. Nobuo Uematsu once again does an outstanding soundtrack that captures \"The Emotion of the Moment\", as I like to call it.GRAPHICS: 4/5 -- The least important to me, but very well done. If the ice looks slippery, well, that's because it IS and you can fall off it.OVERALL 4/5 -- In the end, I believe that great combat alone cannot make a great RPG, which is why I rate LO slightly higher than FF12. If storyline, characters and music are important to you, then you need to play this game. I honestly haven't had this much fun since MASS EFFECT, or for a fantasy genre reference, FINAL FANTASY 9.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2008"}

This is because explained in gameplay, Kirby is turned into yarn and can only use yarn to attack his enemies.Speaking of enemies, I can easily say this is one of the easiest games ever made. You cannot die in this game. Instead, when you're hit or fall of the edge or get squished by the wall, the beads you collect gets scattered all over the place. So while beating the game is very easy, getting a perfect 100 percent in EVERYTHING isn't. This game is HARD if you're trying to get everything from the gold metal to the side quest missions with the other members in the sock.Two player mode is nice, but it's pretty useless if you try to get the gold metal. However, against bosses, it's fun.The plot is simple. Kirby is attacked by Yin Yarn and then sucked into the sock. He saves Prince Fluff and the two work together to save Patch Land and Dream Land.The game is known for its pretty adorable graphics, calming music, easy difficulty and the funny narrator. Seriously, how would Kirby know what pants felt like? It's just random and hilarious.The final boss is probably the most one-sided battle in video game history...and it's awesome. Just saying if they make the game easier, they broke records and making it easier.A great game for casuals but also a good game for those who like a good challenge at 100 percent completion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"\"bosley83\"","summary":"Chrono Cross: Not a Chrono Trigger","reviewText":"SquareSoft makes two types of games.  The very bad and the very good.  Usually there is little gray area.  Well this game is in the gray area.  A nice idea and a good game.  It doesn't quite do it's predecessor justice but it holds it's own.  The music is captivating to say the least.  The opening song will reel you into the game with it's almost sad yet happy sound.  The magic system works like materia but on different levels.  You equip it like materia however in battle you have to build up the ability to cast that spell, and after that you can't use it anymore until the next battle.  It is a very interesting idea that is executed well.  The battle system could be better though.  I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of turn-based battles where you choose everyone's action then watch the battle round unfold.  There is no strategy in it and it can quickly aggravate you because you can't heal that turn and that can end up killing the character in the end because you can't heal immediately.  The battles also move much too slowly, even for this type of battle system.  I got bored playing this game and left it mid-game to collect dust for almost a year when I got the nerve to finally finish it.  The story is interesting but executed in a less than great manner.  The writing (what's woth SquareSoft games and it's writing) is not all that good and it can lead to button mashing to get to the more interesting parts.  The animations are beautiful, simply beautiful.  I found myself going back to past saves just to watch them again.  The having to get minerals and items to create weapons and armors is bad too.  The only reason why it is bad is because it is almost impossible to find enough of these minerals to keep your party, of 40 people if you want, fully equipped.  That and money isn't exactly the easiest thing to come across either.  Buy the game if you want to, I won't hold it against you.  You will either like the game or hate it.  Or you may be like me and indifferent to it.  This is a very difficult game to get a confident feeling with as to whether you will like it or not, but in light of the failure of Final Fantasy VII it is a welcome breeze on a hot, humid day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2001"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

Edwards!","summary":"Pretty average solo, great online","reviewText":"Graphics-It's no surprise by looking at numerous videos and screen-captures of this game that it's a far cry from cutting edge.  The overall technical level of the graphics is either showing its age or they took a hit by having such expansive and large set pieces and characters.  That isn't to say they're awful though.  Each individual looking at this game will likely have to evaluate what they demand in terms of graphics from a game.  I personally would call them passable because while they aren't astonishing the locations of the game are interesting to look at and the enemies and characters you'll meet are appropriate to their settings and fun.  Character and attack animations while mostly understated still manage to be engaging and entertaining with spells being the most impressive of the bunch.Sound-The music thus far has been strictly average.  At times I feel as though I have a pack of bards tailing me because the majority of the songs I've heard having that kind of simple village music sound to them, flutes with little boisterous drive to get the blood boiling.  The voice overs aren't too bad, none of the characters are particularly irritating in cut scenes or battles but the timing does suffer from the typical Japanese to English dub syncing issues.  Overall I'd say everything works on a functional level but it does little inspire the player like a very good score sometimes can.Combat-Battles play out with a bit of a blend between turn based RPG standards with a touch of MMORPG.  Before battles you can set up action bars by placing acquired skills in to slots.  During a fight you will have a circular timer count up and when full you can select an action from your preselected set to use.  At the very start of the game it seems painfully slow due to few options for skills and the likelihood that you don't fully understand how the system works.  As you get more attacks, build combos, and balance your load-out to your liking though it becomes much more enjoyable.  One could for example play a mage with little to no armor wielding a dagger and they'd get turns much faster than a heavily armored melee fighter but the obvious trade off is that they become a bit of a glass cannon by trading defense for speed.  I think there's a lot of not so obvious depth to the combat which makes it rather enjoyable for me.  Granted it isn't a system everybody will enjoy and criticisms against it I feel have been fair from reading other reviews.Enemies-The enemies themselves seem to come in two flavors, big and small.  Small enemies are pretty much what you would expect, find what hurts them and hurt them with it.  Collect your spoils, wash, rinse, repeat.  The bigger enemies however are much more fun to fight and offer more nuanced ways of defeating them.  Early on you'll be fighting trolls for example.  Trolls have 4 targetable zones, their 2 legs, the belly, and their head.  You can defeat the enemy just by hitting it anywhere, it doesn't really matter, but you can grant you and your party opportunities by exploiting the enemy's weakness.  In the case of a troll for example you can shoot out their legs to prevent them from attacking briefly all the while granting your party an increased chance to hit by way of lowering the troll's evasion.  Another option in the single player mode is using the namesake White Knight to put the fight a little more in to proportion but still fundamentally the same.  There's a lot of variety in this sense though.  You'll encounter a limited number of archetypes for the bigger enemies but exploring these alternative and tactical ways of defeating them is both fun and rewarding as I believe attacking certain body parts can yield certain drops a la Monster Hunter (speculation).Skills and Character Progression-Leveling is pretty typical for the most part, kill a bunch of stuff and complete quests to accrue enough experience to advance a level.  Upon leveling up in addition to a base increase to various stats you are awarded 4 skill points.  These points can be used in several different specialties to grant abilities and stat bonuses to your character.  Each individual specialty has 50 things to buy so with 8 trees you're looking at 400 possible purchases, of which I'd say about 80% are skills the remaining 20% being stat bonuses (guestimates).  Needless to say that's a pretty adequate repertoire to choose from.  Individual characters may more or less select from any set but certain story characters are locked out of certain sets.  Your self created \"avatar\" is open to choose from them all though.  From what I've read, but I can neither confirm or deny at this juncture, is that your created character is also given a chance for a re-specialization (or respec as we nerds call it) at level 50 and following the completion of the story mode.  This respec supposedly bumps you back to level 35, refunds all of your skill points, and rewards you with 40 additional bonus points.  This can be done upwards of 4 times.  All things considered it's a very flexible system with a lot of possible appeal to min/maxers by having the ability to dip in to multiple trees.  By about level 22 I had \"maxed\" a single set so those simply going through story mode I imagine will be looking at going fully in to 2 trees or maybe touching base in 2-4.Combos-I just wanted to briefly address the combo system.  After gaining some skills you can freely make your own combos using those skills.  The advantage to a combo is that it allows you to unload several powerful attacks given a single turn counter but they also are costly in terms of battle resources.  In battle you have typical MP which various abilities use, not just magic, and then you also have \"Action Chips\" which for lack of a better way of putting it is effectively a super bar.  So a combo will typically have a pretty steep MP/AC cost but again this is pretty flexible depending on how many and which skills you build the combo with.  Having a good spammable combo is just as viable as having a devastating nuke.The White Knight-The White Knight is a mechanic of the story and doesn't exist in the online mode.  The main character may transform in to the White Knight at will (space permitting) and may stay in the form for as long as he has MP.  Each attack the Knight uses depletes Leonard's MP and once drained he reverts to his normal form.  Your other party members are allowed to fight alongside the White Knight and as you progress through the game, and Leonard develops, you will acquire equipment for the Knight which boosts the combat abilities of your party members in the presence of the Knight.  The Knight also gets a baseline increase in fighting power as Leonard progresses ranging from skills to stats.Story-Save the princess, save the kingdom, save the world.  Nothing to write home about but it's a serviceable and time honored plot.  It won't be moving any story junkies in any particular way but it is peppered with its charming, humorous, and exciting moments.Online-Here we go, this in my opinion is the meat and potatoes of the game and it's single most redeeming factor.  The format is simple, select a quest, recruit some other players, and head out.  This is all organized in common areas called hometowns.  Initially there is only the one generic town which anybody can access but individual players have the ability to create their own town via the game's Georama system.  The town isn't just a place to plop building and look pretty though.  Depending on which buildings you have and who you put in them can alter various factors of your town such as shop inventories.  Upgrading your Georama hometown is a constant endeavor.  Each individual set piece needs to be crafted which requires having various collected materials from the environment and the world's denizens as well as often large sums of cash.  The residents of your home are also drawn from the single-player world where NPCs with green speech bubbles can be openly recruited.  You're only allowed to have so many NPCs in your roster at a given time so you'll often have to revisit your recruitment efforts to select people of specific professions or finding more able individuals to replace poor performers as your town advances (most recruits have requirements to recruit and aren't immediately available).  There's a lot of subtlety to the system though.  Each NPC has a job and having multiple NPCs with the same job, and furthermore selecting a leader amongst them, grants bonuses to their respective categories (farmers, warriors, mages...) when placed in the same building.  On the flip side penalties can also be issued by mixing your NPCs.So you've got your town and you've got your quests, now what?  As you enter in to a quest you will be met with a staging area where people can prep and meet before the quest starts.  Once all the players are organized the leader may manually start the quest or a pre-determined time limit will automatically initiate the quest.  There isn't necessarily anything fundamentally exciting about the online missions but the difficult is ramped up considerably and the rewards are typically quite good for completing them.  Completing a mission in a timely fashion with varying level of completion also grants a rank for the particular mission and a corresponding scaling in the reward.  Being able to coordinate as a team keeps the battles exciting and rewarding and really ties together the various skill sets.  Magic for example does heaps more damage than bow skills but the bow skill set features many abilities to open up weaknesses for the rest of your party.  All things considered it's very fun and does away with what is sometimes a mundane single player experience to get down to the nuts and bolts of what makes the game enjoyable.The online and offline mode are more or less tied together though.  You must advance through the single player to be granted more access to new areas and online quests so unfortunately those completely appalled by the single player would have to soldier through it to fully access the online mode.  On that same note, those who don't care for the solo-player may find it easier to swallow by doing a little here and there as you push your online efforts forward.And that is basically that.  In conclusion I've found that most of the complaints I've read about the game to be fair, or at the very least not wildly off base, but on that same note the bulk majority of them address only the single player campaign.  From this we can gather that this game offers much more value to those willing and able to access the online mode.  That isn't to say that the single player is a chore, it simply isn't overly impressive in any particular way and it's even harder to get excited about coming off of Mass Effect 2 and leading in to Final Fantasy 13 and several other RPGs.  If sold by itself with no online mode I could only recommend this game in good faith at a bargain price or a rental.Pros-Good character customization, looks and abilities.Extremely fun online play.Big and enjoyable enemies.Cons-Forgettable storySomewhat dated graphicsRather average single player","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2010"}

Nintendo games in HD. Yeah, they were the last to the party, but when it comes to Nintendo does that even matter? After 30 years of the same characters, the same plots and essentially the same games re-made time and time again, Nintendo's games have still managed to outsell both PlayStation and Xbox combined.I love my classic Nintendo characters, and being able to play them in High Definition is really easy on the eyes. Because most of these games (Mario Bros, Donkey Kong etc.) don't rely on intense visuals like many PlayStation and Xbox games, the characters look perfectly rendered. The Wii U, which I still think is kind of a dumb name, features it's variety of games with the potential to perform at 1080p and 60 fps. While there technically aren't any Wii U specific controllers the new console has implemented the Gamepad, which I think is unique and effective. The Gamepad provides a great 5th player experience and is used in a variety of neat ways.One of the things Nintendo has done better than anyone else is allow the use of backwards compatibility to the fullest extent. The Wii U is the only next-gen console able to use discs from it's previous console (the Wii). In addition, many of the past Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo and NES games are also available on the Nintendo Store. Like it's prior incarnation, the interface on the Wii U is very similar to the Wii, the difference mainly being that it's much sharper. Also like the Wii there is no Blu-Ray drive, but there are video apps such as Netflix that do support other HD video playback.When it comes to a Nintendo console, the Wii U offers pretty much everything you could ask for in a Nintendo gaming machine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

Almost everything Nintendo sets out to do with the series is a success and comes out with flying colors. Phantom Hourglass successfully brought the series to the DS in a game that was great despite its flaws, and now Spirit Tracks is out as a sequel. It retains a lot of what made Phantom Hourglass great and improves upon the original game in some ways while feeling very similar despite its shortcomings and slow start.Spirit Tracks contains a story that bears little resemblance to any other game in the entire series. The game starts with Link, an aspiring engineer, leaving his little town to get an engineering license from Princess Zelda. Soon after the ceremony, Chancellor Cole and his rather powerful crony Byrne kidnap Zelda and separate her spirit from her body. Their goal is to eventually call the Demon King, Malladus, back out of his imprisonment and reside in Zelda's body, and after that cause who knows what kind of havoc and destruction. Fortunately, Link is able to see and communicate with the ghostlike Zelda, and they set out on an adventure to restore the Spirit Tracks around the land and stop Cole from resurrecting the Demon King.The story is mostly well done, with a solid start that is instantly gripping. The plotline doesn't carry itself through a large portion of the game very strongly, but rather uses that time to develop a unique relationship between Link and Zelda, which is a rather refreshing and charming change of pace for the series, seeing as the two have never spent much time together. Cole is a rather shallow villain made interesting and intriguing simply by his deception at the beginning of the game and entirely creepy behavior, but other characters such as the sages, namely Anjean, help keep the story going alongside Link and Zelda. It's a predictable tale, but it serves its purpose in adding something fresh to the series.The major new element in Spirit Tracks is the train. It is an odd and somewhat out of place object in the game seeing as it's the only part of Hyrule that is even partially industrialized: the rest is just as we remember it in all its medieval-times glory. The train is, obviously, Link's transportation from place to place for the entire game, and unfortunately this is where Spirit Tracks stumbles a bit. Train rides tend to get long, drawn out, and boring even early on in the adventure. There is a warp system, but unfortunately it is made sparse and completely inefficient due to the fact that pairs of warp gates link only to each other rather than just having all of the gates link together. The train is also essential in completing just about every side quest in the game, of which there are plenty, but the hassle of going from place to place diminishes the value a bit. Thankfully the game's length is satisfactory even without doing any side quests.Spirit Tracks, like its predecessor, structures itself around one central dungeon called the Tower of Spirits. Unlike Phantom Hourglass' Temple of the Ocean King, though, it is not necessary to redo the entire temple upon each visit; fans can breathe a huge sigh of relief. The Tower of Spirits is a solid dungeon that is unique in that Zelda is able to possess Phantoms, creating opportunities galore for creative puzzles involving the cooperation between Link and Zelda. By the time players reach the top floor, there will have been plenty of challenge and inventive puzzles along the way that were a treat to solve.Unfortunately the game does take its time in picking up the pace. From the game's start up through the third minor temple it's completely easy going, in fact I don't recall being stumped for more than 30 seconds on any given puzzle in that entire segment of the game. However, after the third dungeon, the game simply bursts at the seams and even explodes with the ingenuity and challenge that is to be expected from a Zelda game. There aren't very many items in the game, but the ones available are put to every use possible to push along the brilliant level design and puzzles.One of the greatest parts of Zelda games has always been the boss battles that incorporate the dungeon's new item in epic, large-scale fights, and Spirit Tracks fully delivers in this area as well. The monsters are always huge, sometimes taking up two screens, and even if a given boss isn't quite that large the battle will always utilize both screens for a better sense of atmosphere and camera angles. Defeating these monsters is usually not too difficult, but the fight is always so grand that watching them writhe in pain and disappear after the finishing blow is a victorious and satisfying moment.One of Phantom Hourglass' great achievements was making complete touch control work very well, and Spirit Tracks follows in that same path with little change. Running, slashing, using items, and any other action can be smoothly executed with simple touches or drags across the lower screen, and it all works about as well as its potential allows. Spirit Tracks also makes the best use of the DS' mike to date. One item allows you to blow a gust of wind by blowing into the mike and the Spirit Flute, an item reminiscent of the Ocarina of Time itself, is played by blowing and sliding the instrument across the bottom screen to play the correct notes. It all works very well and pulls together a simple, smooth, and effective control package.Playing the Spirit Flute is a treat not only because of the clever method of playing the instrument but also because of the music that must be played. Every tune played with the flute is delightfully charming and/or epic; in fact the same can be said about most of the game's other music tracks as well. The train riding music in particular is thrilling and epic, so at least the otherwise dull train rides have such great music to make it a little more enjoyable. I may have bashed the train a lot, but the music really is a bright point about it because it gives the rides a sense of wonder and adventure that otherwise would not have existed.Spirit Tracks pretty much looks the same as Phantom Hourglass. The animation is identical and it still looks pretty solid for a DS game, with smooth animations and remarkably expressive characters. Upon close inspection the graphics look fuzzy sometimes, namely the ground during train rides, but that aspect isn't the overwhelming one: Spirit Tracks is a good looking game overall.The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks may not be the best Zelda game out there, and its issues keep it from being notably better than its immediate predecessor, but it's still a great game overall. Its unique story, improved central dungeon, epic boss battles, use of DS functions, and excellent level design all contribute to its overall quality, despite the dull train rides and slow start. Once it gets going, though, it really gets going, and especially from the fourth dungeon and forward, Spirit Tracks is a great game that's worth playing through the slow start for the more than satisfying second half. Those who haven't played a Zelda game are still better off starting with Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, or Twilight Princess, but for Zelda fans Spirit Tracks is a must play.Positive:+ Refreshing story with a surprising beginning+ Tower of Spirits is a much-appreciated improvement+ Brilliant puzzles and level design in the later part of the game+ Epic and well-designed boss battles+ Controls make good use of the DS' abilities+ Fantastic soundtrack, especially the train riding musicNegative:- Train rides are long and boring despite the epic music- Warp system is sparse and inefficient- Slow and easy early on due to lack of difficulty8.4/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

Well, they corrected the problem by pretty much copying the control scheme and puzzle environments of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, one of the best games in this current console generation.The game is short but sweet.  Rarely any frustration, rarely any repeating.  Now hardcore gamers would be repulsed by that fact they you never have to repeat the same level over and over again or that you won't be struggle over and over again.  However, for just fun, simple gameplay, it's pretty good.You play in a few varied levels, an underground cave, in snow, in the jungle, ancient temple.  All unique and a sight to behold.  The levels have a tremendous amount of checkpoints, so there's no worries about killing the same people or making the same jump over and over again.The gameplay consists of a mixture of action, adventure, and puzzle.  In the puzzles, you'll have to move a certain rock of climb a certain rock to advance to the next stage.  While not difficult, it will sometimes tingle the synaptic nerves now and again.  The action is a simple third person shooter, with a few jumps and quite a few enemies.  The weapons are standard, the shooting and auto-aim work pretty much like the standard fair.  All in all, it's a standard game done very well.It's not all perfect though.  While this game flows well, there are a few moments where the games don't work well.  Most notably, the bosses.  The game falls into the trap where there has to be a giant creature where you have to find the \"trick\" to beat it, and then continuously repeat the \"trick\" or you'll have to repeat the whole ordeal again.  Quite boring and annoying to say the least.  Also, the motorcycle missions are extremely out of place as well.All in all, it's a very good game.

That doesn't mean that this game isn't good, it is more a reflection on me, and the type of games I prefer and derive satisfaction from.  While I have enjoyed playing Mortal Kombat style games in the past (a game this game is loosely based upon), I have never found myself to be an accomplished player, or for that matter even a 'good' player at this type of game.  I may win some of the required fights in the game, but I win ugly.  I never master the required button/stick sequences to make the special moves that give a player an edge in this game and because of that failure, I wind up being frustrated with these games.On the other hand, if I passed this game off to my nephew (as an example), or others that have mastered the special combos and sequences they'd wind up just cruising through this game.  If my nephew, or perhaps my step-son came over and was playing the game, I'd just sit back and watch the cinematics in the game and enjoy watching either of them as they kept winning the matches they were in.  They'd knock out things in probably 1/4 or far less the time that it would take me to even think of getting through the game.If you like the D.C. comics superheroes and want to put them to use fighting their way to victory, this game is for you.  For me, not so much.  Still, to be fair, it's at least a 4 star game for people that enjoy this sort of game and I've tried to score it accordingly here.* Edited to add: I would note that I did buy this game as part of a group of games that I bought for play on my release date PlayStation 4 system.  I've since traded the game back in at Amazon where it will hopefully become part of their \"Used, like new\" inventory and where someone will hopefully get a bargain when they buy that copy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2013"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"DS Must Buy","reviewText":"There's something to be said for nostalgia in games; the games that were awesome then might be a little formulaic and even boring now but still, that game managed to entertain for long, long periods of time back when cartridges had to be blown into to get to run and the war was either Sonic or Mario. Now with so many high-tech graphics, vast amounts of sidequests and things to do as well as multiplayer options, is it worth going through \"Chrono Trigger\", an old-school RPG with appropriately old-school graphics. Well if you're a DS owner, the question isn't \"why would you\" to \"why haven't you by now?\"Story: Taking place literally across all ages, Crono and his friends Lucca, Marle and several others they encounter throughout time have to prevent a possible future from happening: that of the being Lavos and his complete destruction of the world in 1999. Together, you'll travel from the dinosaur-laden Prehistoric times to apocalyptic 2300 A.D. and hopefully stop the world from falling into ruin.Graphics: Square Enix released a port of \"Final Fantasy IV\" originally for the Gameboy Advance with some spiffier, less pixelly graphics while also providing a remake of the game with more improved graphics and CG sequences for cutscenes. What does Chrono Trigger do then? The former. Not that I mind since the game's a classic either way and the art style is still as strong as ever for each era and the cutscenes made for the \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" package on the Playstation are here (though rather compressed quality), it's not the most technically accomplished game but I welcome keeping the original look intact despite cries of outdatedness...as opposed to the \"why can't we have the original\" cries.Sound/Music: Arguably, Square Enix's most well-known composer to work on their games is Nobuo Uematsu though they also have another musical weapon, that of Yasunori Mitsuda who also provided the soundtracks for \"Chrono Cross\" and \"Xenogears\", his 2 masterworks. His soundtrack here is just as noteworthy with several notable themes and unlike some soundtracks which work solely with the game, this is easily a soundtrack to own. Voice acting? Pssh, don't be silly.Gameplay: Typical RPG with levelling up, new equipment, specialized attacks for certain characters though there's a couple unique features. The more popular \"enemy on screen\" system is here rather than random encounters and it doesn't take long to be thrown into battle so thankfully no stylish battle entrances here. Characters have unique attacks called \"Techs\" which can be combined with other characters for even more special attacks/benefits. The techs also can hit more than one enemy should the attack be close enough so for example, a straight fire attack by Lucca might eat one enemy but line up enough and it can nail them all. This adds a bit of strategy since a well-timed wide area attack can clear the battle arena much faster.The usual sidequests are a-plenty here, not a single character is wasted and the story is quite engaging but is there more to see beyond just re-experiencing the game's greatness? Well it's common now but back then the concept of New Game + and multiple endings were relatively new if not brand-new and should you defeat the final boss at a certain point in the story the second time, you got to see a different ending which ranged from the interesting to hilarious. As far as new DS content, it's really just new dungeons, touch screen controls for battle (though being able to specifically click a menu page than scrolling like the original is welcome) and a handy map is good to see.Ultimately,if you're a DS owner and you like RPG's, Chrono Trigger needs to be bought right now. I know its 10$ more than most but honestly, it beats the absurb Ebay prices. No longer an illegal download or a rare and expensive find, every DS owner can now experience the timeless game that is \"Chrono Trigger\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}

(I'll try to update this review after finishing the game.)This entry into the Golden Sun game follows the children of the \"Warriors of Vale\", which may disappoint those who were hoping to control Issac & company yet again on their journey. Not to worry though, the game creators did a great job of fleshing out these characters & animating them. So on to the review:Animation:  Better than the older games, but that's to be expected. Taking into consideration the time period differences between the three games, players can expect this game to keep up the tradition of having excellent graphics for a handheld game.Story: Excellent. It's a little slow to start off, but quickly picks up the pace as you play. Like another reviewer has stated, the game is pretty wordy but then, you should expect that from a GS game.Game Play: Players will be glad to know that you can operate this without a stylus, although using the psyenergy is easier with the stylus than without. The fighting is still turn based like the previous games were, so fans of this style of gaming (like me) will have fun with this.  (Additional: I'm further in the game & can see where others are saying that this is an easier play than the previous 2 games. Still some challenge to it, but so far I haven't seen anything along the lines of the Lighthouses or the Gondowan statue so far, though.)Replay value: I haven't finished it yet, but I can say that this will have some replay value to fans of the GS games or those who like completing all the little tasks they didn't catch the first time through. (I'm going to assume that this game will allow you to go back through the game with your powered up players like the previous two games did.) I will say that the only thing holding some people back from replaying it will be the massive amount of dialogue. If you've played the previous games then this won't deter you, but occasionally I did long for a skip button akin to the one in some of the Zelda DS games.Standalone: You can easily play this without having to have played the previous two games. In fact, that's probably why part of the game is devoted to defining key players, locations, & events in the game. (It doesn't interefere with game play, with the definitions showing up on the upper screen of the DS while the action takes place below. Looking at the definitions is completely optional.) If you look hard, there's also books that you can pick up in various places in the game that give you the story of what happened before. Of course I recommend playing the first games, though- they're worth tracking down!Overall this is an excellent game & I'm glad that I stalked my local GameStop on the day this released so I could be one of the first to get it. While there's some recycled content from the previous games as far as puzzled go, overall this was a pretty fun game to play. Better than the first two? No, unfortunately those who are looking for something to beat the first two games will be slightly disappointed. Is it good as a game on its own? Yep- as a stand alone game this is pretty good. I just hope it doesn't take them another six years to put out another entry in the game!Annendum: (after finishing game)I just wanted to say that after finishing the game, my opinions are quite similar to what they were when I started & wrote this review. I had a lot of fun playing this game & while it isn't as challenging as the original two were, it's still a pretty cool game.There is a replay option, but it is rather limited in comparison to how it was in the previous two games where you could replay from the very start of the game. :(","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"An Excellent Piece of Technology That's Affordably Priced","reviewText":"The PS4 is a well-built machine that gives you a lot of horsepower at a relatively low cost, especially when you consider the fact that its predecessor, the PS3, launched at $200 more for the primary SKU. While it doesn't have many exclusive games at the moment, you're buying into the PS4 for its potential. As Sony demonstrated with the PS3, they know how to create great games with characters you care about, not just soulless experiences that are, sadly, flooding the market on mobile devices. If you want high quality gaming experiences with cutting edge visuals, well-realized worlds and characters, Sony's developers have mastered that craft.As for the hardware itself, I've had no issues with it. There have been some complaints about the blue light of death error, disc read error, and some HDMI issues, but these issues seem to be within the acceptable failure rate for a new game console. Sony's competitors have also had issues reported with their consoles on the internet, so no matter which piece of hardware you buy, there's always the possibility that it could be a lemon, though it's not likely. With my experience, however, the PS4 was easy to set up and get going. The hardware does get a bit warm when running a disc, but if you turn it off in standby mode the fans will continue to run until it has cooled down, then the fans will turn off, so that's nice.As for the controller, it fits well in my rather large hands and feels comfortable during long play sessions. With that said, it's not without issues. I have noticed that the analog stick covers are a bit cheaply made and can often start to wear off if you're rough with the controller. It's a bit of a shame that the controller can have some issues because otherwise it's a very nice controller overall.And as for the games, there aren't a ton of exclusives, but there's enough to satisfy you. My game recommendations are as follows:Infamous: Second Son - One of the best looking games out there, if not the best. Absolutely stunning open world environment.Killzone: Shadow Fall - Not my favorite Killzone game, but definitely still worth playing. It also boasts some impressive graphics.Warframe - It's free to play and it's great fun.Thief - Criminally underrated. Not perfect but I love it. Great atmospheric stealth action.There are more games that you may or may not like, but those are some that I've enjoyed the most.Overall, in my opinion, the PS4 is a very nice system that I can recommend to any gamer looking for a new console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2014"}

We love playing this on long car trips.Likes:*The original cast from the Gamecube version returns, and some characters have new jobs.*The museum has 2 new exhibits: The observatory for looking at constellations, and the cafe where K.K. rocks out!*You can now donate fossils to Blathers without mailing them.*You can get new items like hats and sunglasses.*With the magic pen, it's easier to write letters and make your own design.Dislikes:*No holiday traditions or NES games, but then again, what do you expect from a handheld?Overall, 4 stars. I recommend this game if you want to take it with you on the go, although those who enjoy holiday traditions and NES games will likely prefer the Gamecube version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2005"}

Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"Animal Crossing on the Go","reviewText":"Despite the fact that AC: WW has been out for awhile now, this game still rings true to those familiar with Animal Crossing as being a very \"addictive\" simulation. There's no better way than to bring this game with you on car trips, standing in line waiting for your morning cup of coffee, or anywhere you have spare time.Although the game lacks any real \"ending\" to it, there's much to see and do in the village you create. Fishing, planting trees and flowers, hunting bugs and fossils, or just hanging out in your own pad. Many who have played Animal Crossing on the Gamecube will be pleased with this portable translation.Graphics aren't really stellar here, but still very colorful and adequate. The sounds are varied, with lots of music thrown in for good measure, and the \"animal speak\" is charming, but can grate on your nerves after awhile. This game should be played in small doses, but since things change every day in your village and different events happen on different days (and different times), it's worth peeking in to find out if something new has happened.I realize that Animal Crossing: City Folk is out now, and that most fans of AC: WW have changed to AC: CF, but still....the portability factor makes this game still a worthy addition to your DS library. And age is not a factor in playing, nor gender. Get this game for your DS and you will have plenty to keep you occupied for months to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2008"}

Along with limit breaks (Trances, overdives etc...) and summonings. Along with the heap loads left to do that has nothing to do with the story such as defeating the Emerald weapon or collecting all the cards.This FF has barely any of these traits. The leveling up is tedious because old monster models are used over and over again and the fighting system which is meant to be revolutionary is just irritating and boring. The license board system is annoying because it's impossible to see what makes characters different to others; I understand trying to master all skills but if there are no parameters at all then all characters will be very similar.The characters bore me to death and has one of the worse main characters ever (Vaan just seems to be dropped in without a care). The main story is also nothing compared to the gold of the stories in the older plots; I can't relate to these characters at all.Now I won't lie the FMVs are very impressive, but that's just not enough to make this great.

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Flight_173 \"Flow on\"","summary":"Great if you like this kind of game","reviewText":"I'm a hardcore gammer. I own all of the counsels & ~300 games No Joke. I'm not rich I just don't have a life & invest around 30% of my total income into video games. So consider this review fully qualified. Next let me tell you this isn't my genere game. Why buy it then? Good question. I better go ask my inner gammer voice that one. Anyways I put ~ 80 hours into it and found myself enjoying it. This is the first of their series of games that I've bought. The item storage system could you improvment, and the menues well we won't even go there. Menues as lame as it sounds are THEE most important part of my gamming experience. A game with a good menue is a game thats well organized and easy to play, even if the game is hard. If I can't navigate the menue how am I supposed to navigate the world? There is limited item space, and a large lack of organization. Now on to the gameplay. If hardcore dungeon crawling is your thing this is your game - the dungeon. It's like a suped-up verion of Runescape. Only there isn't a help menue to let you know what to combine with what (you have to do all the guess work yourself). The battle system on the wii is very fun. Everyone likes to swing swords and take down the badies, Especialy when you take down larger than life monsters. The effort to get to that point isn't worth it though. This game relies heavily on players skill (sort of like supersmash brothers on Final Destination with all items turned off). AKA a skilled player that just started playing could take down the normaly imposible monsters with enough time (an hour or three). Oh and the game lists that it's mutli-player on a local scale. Let me claify that for you. YOU CAN NOT PLAY MULTI-PLAYER LOCALY IN GAME. You must choose an option called arena. There you choose pre-made characters to battle against monsters & you get a pooled life system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2011"}

Unless there's some major changes, I could never recommend anyone buy this and it's centered around two MAJOR issues that still haven't been addressed: cost and game library.The PSP's expensive ... really ... really ... expensive.1.  You'll need between two-hundred (the core pack) to two hundred fifty dollars (the value pack) for the PSP itself.  I'd recommend the core system.  The only substantial difference between the two bundles is the value pack comes with a 32 MB memory card.  Anyone who downloads mp3's will already know, a 32 MB card is small to the point of being virtually worthless.2.  A decent capacity memory card is a must-have.  Don't make the mistake of cheaping out and buying a small one, do it once and do it right.  All those mp3's, pictures and game-saves add up fast and having them all saved across several smaller cards is a pain (not to mention easy to lose).  Give yourself about a hundred bucks and get a big one.  I'm thinking 1 Gig kinda big.3.  To pick up a newer game and a movie you're going to have to punk-down another seventy to a hundred dollars.This is the point where I just talked myself out of the sale.  I'm pushing about three hundred seventy dollars, and that's on the conservative side!  I can get an X-Box 360 for that kind of money.  I can get an awesome iPod for a hundred dollars less and have (potentially) 60 Gigs of space.It's a year later and the game selection, outside of MAYBE a half-dozen really great games, is awfully average.  The UMD movie feature is nice, but the movies seem to average about TEN DOLLARS more in cost then their DVD counterparts, with half of the content (it's usually just the feature, no extras).As powerful as the system is, and as cool as it could be, it's just too expensive.  Knock the price down a hundred bucks, and it immediately becomes a much better buy.

Now that I'm really playing this game (after 12 more years of playing other rpgs) I can say the depth, size, scope and just amazing amount of things to do in this game is astonishing.  You are free to do what you want to do from the very start and there are things to do all over the world, places to explore.  It's extremely immersive and overall just an unbelievable old school style rpg.Also, I HIGHLY recommend 1 mod above all others - and that is the Morrowind Complete Overhaul 3.0 mod.

{"product_name":"B004L4G8UC","description":"","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars.......","reviewText":"Out of all the launch titles that came out with the 3DS, I have to agree that Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars is, probably, the most solid title to come out for it. Instead of it being what you'd expect a Ghost Recon game to be, it turns out to be a turn-based strategy title. A turn-based title that's fun enough to where you'll keep coming back to play it more and more, even though the levels can be awfully challenging sometimes(sad to say but that's what kept me putting down Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, Advance Wars:Days of Ruin and Front Mission on the DS for awhile and then come back).However, if you're not into turn-based strategy RPGs, you may want to pass on this on soley for the fact that the campaigns can be a little too long at times. This is turn-based strategy combat done right, though, and is worth your dollar- I assure you.Shadow Wars has multiplayer but, like Advance Wars or Fire Emblem before it, it only allows for two players to share one system. This way, you take turns making commands to your soldiers and passing the 3DS on to the next person. To me, that's a bit of a letdown considering how powerful the Nintendo 3DS is. Another letdown to me is the fact that there aren't any voiceovers in the game, that would have been a nice addition. Too, Shadow Wars could've used the 3D to a better effect than it does. Because of these three things, it makes Shadow Wars feel much like a DS game.Still, you couldn't find a better launch title to get your hands on. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars is a fun title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

The tale is brought to life by an all-star voice cast. Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"The Saga Continues: Through the Door of Darkness","reviewText":"Several years ago, I saw the game KINGDOM HEARTS advertised on television.  I'm not sure exactly what it was about the commercials, but I became interested enough in the game and eventually ended up buying it. It was one of the first games I purchased for Playstation 2.  Upon playing the game I soon became hooked and KINGDOM HEARTS became my favorite video game of all time.  When I finished the game, I couldn't believe it ended on such a cliffhanger and I eagerly awaited the release of the sequel.  It was about four years in the making, but KINGDOM HEARTS II was finally released.The story takes place about a year after Kingdom Hearts ended, following the events of the PSP game KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES. The game begins with a rather long prologue that takes nearly three hours to play through.  The prologue follows the adventures of a young man named Roxas.  Someone is stealing pictures of Roxas and his friends.  In the process it seems that memories are being stolen as well.  The prologue culminates with Roxas uniting with the sleeping Sora thereby filling in the final missing pieces in Sora's heart.Once the prologue is completed, the real action of the story begins.  Sora, Donald, and Goofy, now released from a state of suspended animation begin anew their quest to find King Mickey and Riku who they last saw sealing the door to darkness.  As the renew their quest they discover that the Heartless have returned in force. Not only that, but there is also another group of enemies known as Nobodies.  The Nobodies are more powerful and are led by a group called Organization XIII.  Sora and his friends aren't sure what Organization XIII is up to, but it isn't good.  There's also a mysterious figure named Diz who at times seems to be helping Sora, but other times seems a part of the darkness.  The game follows the trio as they travel from one world to the next defeating Heartless, fighting Nobodies, gathering clues, and meeting up with old friends and making new ones.The gameplay of KINGDOM HEARTS II is a huge improvement over the KH.  Some of the more annoying abilities from the first game have either been done away with or have been incorporated already as part of the characters movements.  Donald and Goofy react much better than they did in the first game, using more powerful abilities and only using items when needed.Players also have full control over the camera angle which is so much better than the shoulder button option that was a part of the original.  Almost all of the star vocal talent from the first game has returned for the sequel, including Haley Joel Osment as Sora, Hayden Panettiere as Kairi, and David Gallagher as Riku.  The music is just as great and the graphics are amazing.  There are times that the plot does get a little confusing, especially if you have no familiarity with KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES.  However, overall the story is just as engaging as the first and ends with a very satisfying conclusion.One of the welcome improvements in game play is the gummi ship component of the game.  Much of the unnecessary difficulty of creating gummi vehicles has been done away with. Not only that, but the ships are easier to fly and fight in than they were in KH.Some worlds from KH are revisited which was one of the major drawbacks to the game because instead of accomplishing anything new on those worlds you were basically replaying the same adventures you did in KH.  For instance, in Agrabah you have to fight Jafar again and though the plot of that adventure contains some elements of ALADDIN 2: THE RETURN OF JAFAR, it's still pretty much a rehash of the things done in KH, but this time instead of trying to free Genie, Sora and company are involved in trying to redeem Iago.  I really enjoyed most of the new worlds the game offered, including a Steamboat Mickey world of the past, the world of Tron, and the world from PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. I also found the time-alternating concept behind the Steamboat Mickey world to be a nice added twist.Other than rehashing some of the same adventures from the first game in a slightly different form, the other major complaint I have about KINDGOM HEARTS II were all the little mini-games.  The prologue takes almost three hours to complete because of all the mini-games that Roxas has to complete. The world of Pooh and Atlantica are back and the entire adventures there consist of mini-games. Not only that, but in order to unlock the secret video at the end of the credits, you have to complete every single component of Jiminy's journal, which includes playing these mini-games over and over several times.The only other thing about the game I didn't like is that there is no theatre mode after beating the game.  The most recent Square games and Asian versions of KH & KHII have featured this feature which allows a person to replay the cutscenes of the game in order and view them as a movie.  This is a wonderful addition that I wish all epic games of this sort would feature. Unfortunately, the U.S. version of the game does not feature this.Despite these complaints, I still find that KINGDOM HEARTS II is a worthy sequel to the KH.  Square and Disney put a lot of time and effort into molding there worlds into the one world which has now become Kingdom Hearts.  The game is very entertaining to play.  The game has been designed to appeal not only to children and youth, but to adults as well.  Experienced gamers might find some of the boss matches a bit too simple, but for a beginner or average gamer, the game has just the right mix of easy challenges and difficulty.Overall, KINGDOM HEARTS II is a game that fans of Kingdom Hearts need and will want to play. It's also a game that non-fans of the series will probably enjoy playing, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"You'll spend HOURS in the Hour of Darkness!","reviewText":"Never in my life have I seen such an original and fascinating game.  This is not your traditional Strategy RPG.  Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is by far one of the most original and most addictive games I've ever played before!  EVERYTHING about Disgaea is different from any other Strategy RPG you've ever played and here's why!The game begins when Loharl awakens from his sleep and discovers his father, king of the netherworld, dead.  Now somebody else has to lead the netherworld and its obvious to Loharl who has to do it.  So how does he do it? By force of course, and that's the first intriguing part about Disgaea, the story is so completely different than what you're used to.  The story paces really well and this is perhaps the funniest game I've ever played before.  You'll die of laughter at the dialouge and humor and the characters are to die for!Disgaea is also different in how the flow of battle goes.  You send up to 10 characters into combat.  For any other Strategy RPG this seems like a lot but for Disgaea this is plenty.  All your allies attack and then your enemies attack, its that simple.But battling puts on a few twist of its own.  If you spend enough time raising your characters (and believe me, you will!) you'll end up reaching the hundreds or even the THOUSANDS on your level.  Leveling up seems infinite in this game.That's not all, but your items and such level up to.  You can go battling \"in\" an item in which you'll have to go down through floors either by defeating all the enemies on a certain floor or by reaching the exit.That's not all about the originality of this game, at the same time there are pyramids that enable abilities in each battle.  They activate panels that do things for you such as some panels make your characters invincible.  Others won't benefit you in this way and instead may benefit the enemy.  If you find the pyramid that coresponds to the panel color you can destroy it and cause a chain reaction.Again, this isn't all.  The game has its own glitch where in battle you can do a combo so long as you've got more than one character on an enemy.  So if you put a level one enemy up against a level four hundred enemy and have him participate in the combo, you can raise levels quite easily.The story paces along nicely and you can do any mission over again to level up your characters.  If you love making super powerhouse characters like I do, then you won't pass up the oppertunity to rush into battle with a level one hundred character early on.The game also lets you \"create\" your own characters.  Yes, create your own character.  Not \"hire\" them, not have a new clan member seek membership but create them.This isn't even the peak of its wackiness.  When you create a character you can also transfer abilities to help make a more super power character.  Disgaea is ALWAYS ahead of you however.  If you make a super powerful character the next mission will be sure to have one.Disgaea is an immensely different game.  It is by far one of the greatest strategy games ever made becasue it is so different.  You'll spend hours playing it and you won't regret it... the only \"real\" problem with the game is that your friends and family will feel neglected.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2004"}

Not only did it get some of the best games from some of the world's best developers, they were churning out the hits as fast as they announced them. Nintendo's \"quality over quantity\" policy clearly didn't win over most gamers so fans of the Nintendo 64 learned to be patient and to be humble. Still, the N64 was home of some of the best games that didn't get released on Sony's console. And you can thank Rare for keeping us fans busy with their excellent games. Conker's Bad Fur Day, released in 2001,was Rare's last game for the Nintendo 64. What started out as a cutesy, Mario style platform game featuring squirrels, bears and flowers turned into the most sinister and foul mouthed platform game that anyone has ever seen. So take away the toilet humor, perverted jokes, the bleeped out cursing, blood, gore & suggestive sexual themes and you STILL have a great game worth playing through.You control a squirrel named Conker who just celebrated his 21st birthday by hanging out and drinking with his friends. He drinks way too much and sports a major hangover to the point that he can't find his way home. And this is where you come in. You help him sober up and find his way home but then he gets sidetracked and goes on a mission where he explores his world, helping people along the way with their errands all the way until he goes toe to toe with the main bad guy who wants to take over his world. I don't want to give too much story away but Rare borrowed elements from some popular movies of the time and blended it in here along with hilarious and outrageous moments that happen to Conker. Your character does not have any special powers or abilities; you progress by helping out people you meet and through \"context sensitive events\": basically, hit a specific button when prompted. The game saves your progress and when you are done with the single player mode (or need to take a break from it), you can try out one of several multi-player modes (by yourself or with 3 other players.)The PROS: The graphics, music, controls and sound effects are top notch here and bring Conker's world to life. The story is hilarious and while it makes fun of movies from the late 90's, it still brings a chuckle or two out of you. It's a long game so it will keep you busy and sometimes a little challenging. I haven't played too much of the multi-player modes but they are fun and are a good excuse to have your friends play along or against you.The CONS: The graphics can get a little choppy when the action gets intense but that's what to be expected. Surprisingly, this game doesn't require the expansion pack like other titles so Rare could have taken advantage of it to prevent the choppy graphics or lessen the effect. Also, sometimes it is hard to figure out where to go next and a few of the puzzles really require you to think and observe your surroundings.This game was a great example of how good gaming on the Nintendo 64 got and while it arrived near the end of the console's lifespan, it still sold a decent amount of copies. It will be hard to get a copy of this game so it probably is best to get it used since a new copy would cost a lot of money. If you missed out on playing this game back or thought this was \"too kiddy\" to play, then make the effort to find it. This is NOT for kids and only for the grown ups. I recommend it to all N64 fans and to those who never played it before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

Luckily, it was not. What do you get for $14.99? Oh, positively one of the best, if not THE best Stand alone DLC experience you can buy right now. Ubisoft Montreal have somehow combined the humorous nostalgia of 1980s action movies with their current Far Cry engine; to create an experience that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger wish he was young once again. To top off the look and feel, Michael Beihn (known for Aliens, The Terminator, Navy Seals) even offers his gruff voice to portray Rex Power Colt, the Mark IV Cyber Commando you control to thwart the evil schemes of your previous commanding officer. The adventure is full of one liners, crazy action situations, and just plain over the top stupidity that you can't help but love and laugh at. Even the soundtrack provided by electronic band, Power Glove, fits with Blood Dragon's look providing familiar yet needed sound queues for every situation. Although the in game cut-scenes are not what you call \"current generation,\" they do however provide a wonderful ode to old school story telling for video games from the 80s. If you don't laugh at the Terminator or Predator references within the first 5 minutes, you must not have a funny bone within you...or you are too young to understand.The cons:*For PC, you have to use Ubisoft's version of DRM game management, UPlay, no matter if you are already using Steam or Origin. It's a minor inconvenience, but you can simply set it to go into offline mode after you install and register Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.*PC default controls seem off to me like Far Cry 3's did. The game feels more comfortable using an XB360 controller, even though my aim suffers this way. It's either hit or miss here.*The game's length is considerably shorter than Far Cry 3's single player gameplay. There are no multiplayer modes within it. So if this upsets you, what were you expecting? Wait till it's cheaper if this offends you.*Some additional objectives/side quests can get repetitive and lack variety, but somehow are still fun to do. The downside is there are no skill trees like Far Cry 3 had to coincide with your XP gain. Skills are automatically unlocked per level. Also there is no crafting. So in order to obtain weapon upgrades, you have to complete these additional missions and spend money to customize your weapons.*The Island's look is either hit or miss. People will either complain that it's too dark, or it fits perfectly as a \"neon hot pink\" Tron styled environment.*The game is pretty damn easy. Fun, but way too easy. Play on Hard for a boost in challenge.If this was a risk for Ubisoft to create Blood Dragon, I sincerely hope they take more like this. So far the 7 hours I played of Blood Dragon have been pure 80s bliss. After 4 hours of playing it, I immediately wanted to go watch the Terminator and Robocop for the 1000th time. It's such an awesome and hilarious ode to games and movies that I loved as a kid. So, if you don't own or have played any of Far Cry 3? No problem, once again, this is purely stand alone content(2.98 gigabytes big). Did you grow up, experience the 80s and that era's movies? Also, are you a fan of first person shooters particularly open world like what Far Cry and Crysis have to offer? Then what are you waiting for? Stop reading this and download this now!

Both hide retractable blades under their sleeves and scale incredibly steep architecture in order to track down their targets. Like Altar, Ezio becomes hellbent on revenge, taking down an ever-growing conspiracy in order to avenge his family and restore order to the world. But while the shrouded assassin from the Holy Land was a bit of a loner, his Italian cousin has charisma and wit to spare. And like Ezio, the second installment of Assassin's Creed is more dynamic and exciting than the first.Even within the first few missions of ACII, we get to really know Ezio - not the cunning swordsman or the stealthy assassin, but the loyal son and the carefree playboy. In other words, we're introduced to the man under the hood long before he begins to wield his sword. Though much of the protagonist's motivation is well-trodden territory, spending time with Ezio is much more enjoyable. He's a swashbuckler that feels much more in line with the Sands of Time Prince of Persia.But unlike the prince, our hero boundaries are virtually non-existent. With a little patience, any tower can be climbed, and virtual parkour enthusiasts are rewarded with breathtaking views of the Italian cityscapes. This was the greatest thrill in the first game too. But the problem there was that after you eagle-dived into a bale of hay or two, there weren't many hooks to keep you playing.It's a common complaint, and I won't harp on it. But ACII's missions are so much more varied. No longer do you have to skulk about in the shadows, gathering intel before another formulaic assassination. Instead, NPCs dish out everything you need to know before charging into battle. You'll get to command your own mini-armies, steer gondolas, protect a carriage under siege and try out some of your best bud Leonardo da Vinci's experimental inventions. Missions will often have you doing these tasks in sequence. You can tail a courier through and above the Venetian canals, only to engage in sword-fight minutes later.Though these missions push the story forward, I had even more fun with all of the new extracurricular activities. Like a 16th century Crackdown, ACII is littered with feathers, treasures and perches to track down (though all of them can be found on maps, so none are as maddening as the agility orbs). Additionally, there are optional footraces, assassinations, fisticuffs with unfaithful husbands and courier jobs.However, the two obvious highlights are the Assassin's Tombs and the city restoration. The tombs are great simply because they dispose of all the silly fighting and just let you climb all over everything. It's a throwback to the PoP series' best moments, with some light puzzles and convoluted obstacle courses. Once you've completed the tombs, you can bring back your haul to Uncle \"It's-a-Me\" Mario's manor to help restore the surrounding village, Monteriggioni. Buildings and storefronts can be renovated, and with nearly every item you buy, a percentage of the money is invested in the town as well. Like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, your empire accrues a sizable amount of money, which can in turn be used to buy better weapons and armor.Because the rewards are tangible this time around, you'll feel compelled to explore every last nook and cranny of each city. While it was fun to move around in the first game, it's more fun to explore in ACII.I wish the same could be said about combat, which does open up later on but still feels like a distraction from everything else. Late in the game, enemies will block every single sword strike, and your only effective options are parrying or disarming them. Fights often become dances in which you circle your Templar partners, teasing them to lunge so that you can fool them every time. Though you have ranged weapons, they're usually rendered useless whenever a guard alerts his comrades.If you're familiar with the AC mythology, you may be wondering why I haven't mentioned the Animus and the 2012 conspiracy that connects all of these historical threads. Quite frankly, I guess I've stopped caring by this point. These future moments feature the same wonderful voice acting and some intriguing plot twists, but in the end, they end up hurting the pacing of Ezio's quest. Long stretches will pass between the Desmond chapters, and it's hard to remain invested when you never see outside of the tiny lab.It's clear that Ubisoft Montreal is building up Desmond as a viable savior, and I would guess that a later installment will actually let him loose in his own time. But the Templar conspiracy at the heart of the story doesn't feel as deeply rooted as it should. The rebel characters reveal quite a bit, but Ubisoft still needs to build that world in the same way as they did with Italy. Right now, I'm frustrated because Desmond's less developed plot seems to take precedence over Ezio's, which leads to an unfortunately abrupt conclusion for both.But after the credits roll and the gang concludes that there's much work to be done, Ezio is brought back to Monteriggioni for more treasure hunting and acrobatics. Lucikly, the always-thrilling leaps of faith will stay with you much longer than the unsatisfying cliffhanger.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

Willis \"game player\"","summary":"It's different.","reviewText":"I was kind of disappointed with Final Fantasy X-2. After playing Final Fantasy X, I thought this game would continue on that note. It's about 3 teenage girls, one of them Yuna, who was so grown-up and serious in Final Fantasy X, and in this game she seems so immature. The game story to me has a much lighter note . The game play consists of different assignments, and you don't get rewarded until the 'mission' is accomplished. Like I said, I personally am not that fond of this game, but teenage girls might like it just fine. One thing that I like better here than in final Fantasy X is that you get more items after each battle, which is great for item collectors. Also you have the freedom to go wherever you want to on the world map. So you don't have to start in Besaid like in Final Fantasy X. Also the learning 'new ability' system is better in my opinion. You can learn 'Thunder Blade' for example and don't have to rely on the game maybe dropping the 'Thunder Blade' weapon. The leveling up system is back again too, which I also like better than the sphere grid system of its predecessor.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2007"}

It definitely makes your movements more accurate with what happens on the screen, but I myself really hate the bulkiness at the end of the wii remote. You have to add an attachment to the end of your remote, making it a bit heavier and just not as comfortable to hold. So I searched for an alternative, which happened to be their newest version of the wii remote called the \"Wii Remote Plus\" where it is a normal sized controller that has motion plus built in already, so there is no bulkiness/attachment at the bottom of it. They are currently selling these remotes on Amazon for about $38 or $39 each (depending on the color you choose) or you can even buy them at places like Best Buy for about the same price. Even though it is a higher price to pay I would highly recommend getting this vs. the attachment simply for comfort purposes alone. It's that much better in my book to pay extra for the newest wii remotes. What I am doing is keeping my original wii remotes and buying 2 additional wii plus remotes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

Last year it was Mario Galaxy that had the best level design, biggest degree of creativity, and simply the best overall package. This year, it is this game with all those features and then-some.Sack-boy, the lovable little guy who is the main focus of this game is one of the most simplistic and coolest character's I've seen in videogames. The game itself reminds me of the days of old in gaming when levels were almost like puzzles where you didn't just kill every enemy and gain power to get through them unscaithed, but you actually had to create a pathway to even escape the level.In all honesty, this game isn't the first to do this. It borrow's elements of the computer series The Incredible Machine where you had to use mechanical devices, lever's, and pullies to try and create a way through any given level. It is a side-scrolling adventure where you collect numerous goodies in a somewhat open-ended world not unlike the cult classic Tomba! series on PS1. It also gleans of charm that has always shone through on the cute gaming titles created by Nintendo.Its hard for me to imagine where this idea started for the development team though. In this game you control our little Sack-boy and make him do a somewaht limited number of things which include but are not limited to, run, jump, and move objects as needed. Thats the core gameplay really, three simple manuevers. The ingenius thing about it is, again much liek Mario Galaxy, is HOW the levels are designed so that you almost never do the same thign twice. I can't tell you how much fun it is to watch the little sack-meister hopping around in the big, wide world trying to just make it to the level's scoreboard.This is more of a thinking man's game than most. Its not a complex puzzle game and you will hardly ever be stuck for more than a couple of minutes, but it doesn't even matter. The charm of LBP is its design. Even the music, as someone already stated is charming. This game can be enjoyed easily by anyone with a fully developed brain and is certainly hours of fun for kids age 5-6 all the way to the older generation's that are 60+. I wish more video games would take this kind of approach. I find myself wishing that I'd fall into a dream right now, just so I can give the little sack people some more stuff to do =D(when you play the game, that statement won't seem so moronic, lol).If you own a PS3, this is an ABSOLUTE must-play videogame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"Happy Medium Between Casual and Core Gaming","reviewText":"THE INCLUDED GAME: This isn't my favorite motion-control game ever (that honor would probably go to Metroid Prime 3 or either of the Super Mario Galaxy titles), but it is hands down my favorite casual motion-control title. It is stunningly accurate. I've heard some complaints about table tennis. Table tennis is hands down my favorite sport in this game. As a semi-professional table tennis player, trust me -- it works accurately.Archery is also a blast. As is, strangely enough, Bocce -- a game I never had much fun with in real life. Another winner is the gladiator duel section of the game. This is the closest motion control has gotten to the 1:1 \"lightsaber\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" moment so many have wanted since the Wii was first announced as the \"Revolution.\"The game isn't perfect. Using two controllers almost seems to be a marketing gimmick to get you to buy a second controller, even if you don't need one. While Gladiator is somewhat better with 2 controllers, archery works MUCH better with only one Move controller. Archery is twice as hard with two controllers.Complaints and quibbles aside, this really is a fine game. It's pretty much what we were promised by Nintendo with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. While fun, those games felt lacking. Sports Champions really is the perfect motion-control sport game. It just took it 5 years to finally arrive.THE CONTROLLER: It works fine for what it does and it's far more accurate than even the Wii Motion Plus, but $50.00 per Move wand is a lot to ask. Especially when the batteries run dry in less than 6 hours and take a good 4 to recharge. This is VERY annoying. I thought my first controller was broken, but the second Move controller I bought was charged for the same length of time and took just as long to recharge.The other problem with the Move controller is you need a decent sized living/gaming room. It's not as bad as the Kinect (to own a Kinect and properly use it, you must reside in a castle), but the Move needs a MINIMUM of 8 feet to work optimally for games. If the space between your furniture and your television isn't at least 8 feet, you're spending money on something that will not work properly on certain games (including some of the events in Sports Champions).THE PS3 EYE: Unless you're in a VERY well-lit room with LOTS of natural front-lighting (in other words, you only play during the day), your image will be grainy and full of colored splotches. This affects the game, because you are able to take photos \"holding\" a virtual bow, paddle, sword, etc. and, all the photos I've taken, have shown a barely visible grainy version of me holding the item. This makes them unusable (you're allowed to upload them to Facebook). Sony really needed to get this right prior to release.NAVIGATIONAL CONTROLLER (not included with the starter bundle): This was originally titled the \"sub-controller\" and that was much more fitting. Sony is somehow getting away with charging $30 for half a dual-shock. Only, it's not really half a dual-shock as it features NO RUMBLE. So, you're getting half a six-axis, right? NO. There is NO motion control feature included for your $30. This, to me, is the most disgusting thing about the Move setup, especially considering you REALLY DO need the navigational controller for games like RE5 and Heavy Rain. I guarantee Sony will add rumble to the navigational controller within the next 6 months. So, if you're not a hardcore gamer, I'd wait.OVERALL: I've spent a LOT of time with the Move, the Wii and the Kinect. If you want ONLY the most CASUAL as CASUAL gaming can be type games, the Kinect is your toy. It certainly has the more impressive technology. But, if you actually game because YOU enjoy GAMING, the MOVE is the motion-control item for you. Owning the Kinect, Move and the Wii, I feel safe saying the Move is the most accurate of the motion control controllers and also the happy medium between casual and hardcore games. The Move is the motion controller for everybody.I hope this helps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings.

When deadly Alliance came out I knew I wanted it and it didn't disappoint. Me and my sister used to spend lots of time playing this together and it was alot of fun. It does have its flaws though, but I'll adress them while I show some of its features. Its been awhile since I've played this one, so I'll try to put as much info as I can.1. Profile: Given that this was my first 3d MK game I'm not sure if profile is a new feature or not. All you do is start a profile and make your own password. Through this you can buy extras and new characters by earning coins in Konquest mode or Arcade fight. If you play with two players you can bet on coins through fights with each other. Your progress is automatically saved when you ext your profile.2. Konquest: I have mixed feelings on Konquest. Konquest is a good way to earn coins, but it suffers some flaws. For one Konquest is technically nothing but training, except you're going through different stages and to move on you must master the fighting technique of the character you're faced off with. This becomes a problem later on with certain characters like Raiden. When you have to masterthe more complex combos, the controls won't always respond making so you have to go back to the first fighting style and start over. What makes it an even bigger pain in the ass is that sometimes you do execute the combo, but the game won't let you move on because the last attack in the combo didn't hit the computer. That ruined the experience alot for. I can't begin to name the countless hours I spent on Raidens 3 part combos because it wouldn't execute properly no matter how good my timing was. Konquest also gets kind of boring after awhile which is why I'm happy Deception added more to it. To be honest I still haven't passed all of Konquest because of these flaws.Arcade: The highlight of every MK game is the arcade. The Kombat is how you expect it. Every character has a special move they execute by pressing R1. You fight in 3d rendered areas, but you're limited to a small space by invisible walls. I don't really like that. It would be cool if you had more free ranges to fight. Luckily later games got rid of this. Some levels have special obstacles are trapps you can use for a fatality or to damage yoour opponent which is a cool addition to the series. Between certain stages you get a bonus minigame where you test your might or sight. Test you Sight is way easier the Might. In test your sight there are cups in front of you that move around. You are shown where the coin is under and have to find which cup has it.Krypt: The krypt is scattered with coffins that are label with a set amount of coins. Be careful though because some coffins are empty. The hardest coins to achieve are the Onyx and Silver coins. If my memory serves me, the only way to earn both coins is either konquest or test your might or sight, so collecting them is a hassle due to thier rarety. I remember having tons of Saphire, Jade, Gold, and Ruby coins but barely of them two.Deadly alliance for its time was a fun 3d Mortal Kombat. What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that compared to Deception which is my favorite of the series Deadly Alliance is kind of dull. Konquest is linear, Arcade is fun but stages are small and bland, and controls are a little flawed. Despite this if you're an MK fan its still worth a buy. For other get Deception.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Vicente Drago \"Shaun O'Donnell\"","summary":"Best fighting game out there","reviewText":"There are basically 2 types of fighting games out therem the ones that require a lot of stradgy (Virtua Fighter 4, Bushido Blade) and Button Mashers (Tekken, Dragon Ball Z Boudoki).  For most gamers they are one or the other.  Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance however is a first, in what I mean is that it is both a button masher and a stradgy style.  Let me explain.Each Kombatant has 3 styles, two martial arts and one weapon.  Unlike #4 you don't lose your weapon when hit, and they don't do extreme amounts of damage when used.  However like the two styles they can be used to string comboes together.  However on the same token it is not neccesary to learn stradegy to beat story mode (it can help but not neccesary).The story revolves around Shang Tsung and Quan Chi teaming up to take over both earthrealm and OUtworld.  After Vanquishing the two realms greatest champions (Shao Kahn and Lui Kang) they set forth a series of events to conquer the two relms.  Raiden relinqueshes his status as elder god to take on this force.  He allies himself with Kung Lao, Sub-Zero and his apprentice Frost, Sonya, Jax, and Johney Cage.  They then set forth to take out Quan Chi and Shang Tsung.  Also in the mix are the returning Scorpion, Kitana, Kano, and Cyrax.  The new characters are very diversed as well, from Bo Rai Cho and his prefered style of Drunken Fighting, to Mei Li who wants to rescue her clan, to Kenshi the blind warrior out to slay Shang Tsung, to Drahmin an Oni from the Netherrelm.The one thing that did not change (besides the awsome Fatalities) is the fact that the sub boss (past guys were Goro, Kintaro, and Motaro) is the creature called Molock.  Molock has no specific skills, little fighting moves, but is very fast, relelntless, blocks a lot, and is powerful.  This makes for a very frustrating battle with some characters.  However with others it is a cake walk (well sort of).Overall this is the best fighting game out there for the average gamer.  It doesn't require a lot of time memorizing skills and timing that virtua fighter 4 requires, yet at the same time is not as simplistic and a pushover that Tekken 4 is.  This is the must own fighting game for the average gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2002"}

My favorite! Fast loading, very smooth running, well polished game. The sky is breathtaking!+ Control and motion come very natural and easy. Menu's and the option to \"defib\" yourself back into the game are wonderful.+ Characters are friendly & inviting; their mission requests are not tedious like other games. I enjoy finding a new location, with a new group of people to talk with, and a new set of missions to accomplish. Voice acting is wonderful. Might recognize a few actors.+ The Enemy AI is very nice. Enemies will hold a wound after being hit or shot, fall down and shoot back, and make inappropriate comments with others about planning your demise.+ Open world style, great vehicle choice and driving control, Story and over-all style of the game have a lot of thought put into each detail and aspect of the visual game and game play itself.+ Multiplayer buggy racing is a lot of fun. I could spend hours just on that. Co-op multiplayer missions are fun to complete, if you can find someone to stay with you the entire level.+ Game Trophies are not annoying or wearisome; they are fun and will most likely be achieved through regular play through of the game. Keep an eye out for the Playing Cards and recipes though.+ Wonderful music. Perfect for such an atmospheric game. Mesh very well together.CON's- You need to remember to save. There are no auto-save or checkpoints throughout the level or area you are in. Can get very frustrating when you are really getting into the game and playing for hours, then die and have to play it all over again. Stopping game play to save takes you out of the gaming experience.- There is no split-screen for the full game campaign. There are side story split-screen missions that you can play with a friend or online co-op.I play a lot of games, and I must say that this is one of the rare times where I got hooked almost immediately. I did not want to stop, so I didn't. I was amazed by the high detail level, yet the incredibly smooth control and game play. Usually games with such high detail are sluggish and lethargic (like Dead Island). Rage is one of the clearest, most detailed, and smoothest running games I have ever played. Visually you can see for quite a vast distance full of clarity and high depth. Yes, there is some texture popping from time to time, however this is not distracting from the game play and I rather have some texture loading than sluggish game play.People can compare Rage to many other games, however it reminds me most of Borderlands with a touch of Fallout and a pinch of Mad Max. However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? \"O, he is holding a rifle, so this game reminds me of Modern Warfare 2\". Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.There are fun, albeit frustrating, little mini games throughout the world that you can play to earn cash so you can buy things in one of the shops around the towns. Sort of reminds me of the little mini games in Red Dead Redemption. Each game is a trophy if you beat the last level of that mini game challenge.At the shops you can buy quite a plethora of items. Ammunition for your weapons and vehicle weapons, recipes for building weapons or devices, and a lot more can all be purchased from a shop. You earn money by completing mission, racing, or selling the items you find in your journeys.The Multiplayer is a lot of fun as well. Playing co-op missions have their pros and cons. It is fun to play with another so you can back each other up and revive if necessary. However I have had many times where the other player dropped out or left in the middle of playing which can get very annoying if you are trying to get the multiplayer trophies.It is a shooter game, not a role-playing game. But it has more to offer than just random mind numbing killing like many FPS. It does have a story with missions and characters, a spacious area and cool locations, and solid game play any fan of FPS or RPG should be happy. It is not an adventure game as much as just a shooter. A lot depends on the way you play it. I have spend hours and hours just walking around looking for stuff. But you can also just go to your destination and shoot anything that moves.Rage is a beautiful game graphically. I often find myself walking along and I stop just to look around at the breathtaking sky and the powerful detail in each and every little thing. I still cannot get over how smooth the game runs for how detailed it is. This new id Tech 5 Engine will blow any predeceasing game out of the water and I cannot wait to see what gaming future holds for this powerful engine.Rage has entered in game of the year territory and they have already announced a sequel, maybe a prequel. Any gamer teetering whether to get this or not should not hesitate. It has enough of a variety of game play to please any gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Having read some of the descriptions of the game, it sounded interesting enough, and the price was relatively cheap.  Plus, it came with two \"side\" games also developed by That Game Company.One side game, Flower, is deceptively simple.  Just fly around using the six-axis controller and collect the petals of other flowers as you come into contact with them.  That's it.  That's the game.  For something so simple, it is oddly fun.  Who'd have thought that flying a petal to collect and \"lead\" other petals would be so fun?The other side game, flOw, is similar in control scheme, that is, using the six-axis controller.  This time, the gaming system is more complex.  Imagine a 2D world, that has three dimensions.  By this it is meant that the player moves along a 2D plane and eats orbs or eats the orbs of other floating critters.  However, it is possible to move to another 2D plane three dimensionaly by moving either towards or away from the camera, either coming towards the surface, or going deeper down into the underwater world.  The mechanics take a little to get used to, but the reward is great.  This is also a multi-player game so friends can join in.Then the belly of the beast.  The actual game Journey itself is a masterpiece.  It is a shock that all three of these games are made in conjunction with Santa Monica Studio, the very same that made the God of War series, yet there is no killing.  There is only one \"bad guy\" (multiple of them at times, but still the same basic character).  The game style is basic.  Look, move, fly, and \"call\".  That's it.  Two joysticks (or one joystick and the six-axis) and two buttons.  So that is easy to master.  Even a 68 year old father who doesn't play video games mastered it quickly.The graphics are great, perfect for the artistic style of the game, which is very unique.  All the concepts are so unique, from the character design, to the populating critters that fly around, to the point of the game (enlightenment and rebirth).  Even the lighting on the sand is so on point, it makes backs tingle with electricity.  It is a tranquil game that shouldn't be as fun as it is because there is no blood, no guns, no explosions, no naked babes; all of which can be found to be very much a relief from the onslaught of destruction pervasive in gaming today.Overall this is a stupendous game that will be played over and over.

Even in a live class, if the professor were to prattle on like this the audience would be lost out of boredom and wondering what motivated it.  Explain it in the book or on a website, not page after page on the tiny screen.But there is more on the positive side to say about this software than on the negative.PRO: This is not a game.  While it could be more engaging and enjoyable I have to say it's extremely well done and really does provide a quality evaluation, drilling, and learning experience.I do not agree that a mastery of word structure or a more sophisticated vocabulary makes for better communication, but in terms of linguistics this is far more than you could expect from a piece of software made for a handheld gaming device.  Praise goes to Nintendo of course for creating this subculture of handheld gaming as a learning device--and on the cheap--but the creators of this particular software deserve a lot of credit for the level and quality of the content here.BOTTOM LINE: While I wouldn't recommend this as fun or agree with the premise that better communication is a matter of greater vocabulary, this is a great piece of software for those who want to develop their ability to understand even unfamiliar words, where it's more about your ability to reckon an answer rather than know it.I love the fact that it teaches the student to think of the composition of words, because this is a valuable reasoning skill. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun way to digest this material, it doesn't make the grade.I recommend it for those serious about improving their linguistic abilities, but don't buy the idea that it will make you a better communicator and therefore do such magical things as increase your income or cause people to listen to what you have to say any moreso than they do currently as it seems to be claiming.I only take one star away overall simply because I don't agree with the hypothesis, but this is five star work.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2008"}

Or any other console, for that matter. It's beautiful to watch, smooth to play, emotionally involving, and, most importantly of all, genuinely terrifying.The plot concerns Miku, who has come to a haunted Japanese mansion house in order to search for her lost brother Mafuyu. From a family of psychic spirit-communicators, Miku is soon absorbed in unravelling what happened not only to her borther, but to a team of paranormal investigators, and to the original family. It's a beautifully grim tale of ritualistic suicide, demon-worshipping and powermongering, and I promise you, it's worth the ride.The control system, like all horror adventures in this mold, will never be perfect, but FF goes a huge way towards redressing the balance by removing traditional weapons like guns and replacing them with a Camera. Yes, a camera. Your ammo is differnet exposure-speed film and you upgrade the tool with the amount of souls you manage to capture with it. Ghosts are already dead, and it's up to you to exorcise them. The fluidity of movement involved with a weapon of this nature is a huge relief from the slow aiming and reloading process so long associated with the pistols and semi-automatics from the Biohazard and Silent Hill games.The graphics, too, deserve a special mention, becuase they're beautiful. The monochromatic minimalism and traditional Japanese design seem all the more upsetting for those of us not from that culture, and the ghosts themselves are a truly disturbing mix of traditional Shinto folklore and tortured, Francis-Bacon-esque faces.The sound works on the same principle. All is silent until something upsetting tears through that silence and forces us to look. Droplet effects and various footstep sounds have also been used to create a magnificent aural atmosphere, the best I've ever witnessed. And I've played plenty.My only complaint is the difficulty level. It takes a huge step up after the Second Night, and chances are you'll have wasted all of your stronger film on the earlier demons. Play it often and frugally, however, and you'll avoid this fate.For atmosphere and sheer terror alone, Fatal Frame deserves the crown of Survival Horror. Happily, Tecmo have given us a beautiful and innovative game to go with that atmosphere. I can't recommend it highly enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2003"}

I used to swear by the PS2 Dualshock controller (yeah, I know you XBox fanboys just cringed cuz I said PS2, but I don't care, I just love games). Anyways, I didn't think any controller could best the PS2 Dualshock. I was wrong. This wireless controller is actually extremely comfortable, even more-so then the Dualshock. Also, unlike the new PS3 SixAxis controller, it actually feels nice and solid, not cheap and plasticy. I absolutely love it.Wireless is definitely the way to go. I have two extremely hyper Australian Shepherds and I can't tell you how many cords they've chewed, or how many times they've ran through my living room and tripped over cords from other controllers i've owned in the past - causing either the controller or the console to come crashing down. It's like the difference between having a typical universal remote for your TV and having a universal remote for your TV with a cord (yeah, they don't exist with cords but imagine if they did... just not quite right) - or it's like the difference between a infared cordless mouse and a ball-and-chain mouse. My couch is just far enough from my TV so that when I am using a controller with a cord I have to lean over so my cord isn't stretching across the living room. This controller frees me from that, I can just sit back and relax now. It's SO much better. I like how the analog sticks are placed on this controller. When I use the Dualshock now it seems like the analog sticks are much too low. This controller feels perfectly natural.There is one tiny complaint though. I almost knocked it down to four stars but I just couldn't. I would give this controller a 4.5/5 if I could. My complaint is that the analog sticks slip a tiny bit sometimes - which doesn't happen on the Dualshock because the analog sticks on the Dualshock are coated in rubber, as opposed to the plastic analog sticks for this controller. This is only slightly annoying for me in games like Gears Of War where perfect aiming is essential. It's a bit easier for me to aim with the Dualshock controller. Perhaps this is just an issue because I'm so used to the Dualshock. Other people don't seem to have this problem so it's probably just me.This controller RULES!

The graphics actually take a step backward from the first Deus Ex.  The RPG element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game, making it nearly unplayable.  The plot is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered.  The maps are small, which means very little exploring.Overall, this game is not worth the box it comes in.  I am very disappointed that Eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public.  Shame on you Eidos.

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"\"I'm back, baby!\"","reviewText":"We never thought it would happen...Endless restarts.  The all-time champion of vaporware.  And a game that, for the longest time, seemed doomed to forever remain in limbo.But now, 14 years later, the king is back.Duke Nukem Forever is finally here.Right off the bat, it should be said that, even with it's lengthy development time, Duke Nukem Forever will never, ever live up to the hype that's been over a decade in the making.  Much like \"Star Wars:  The Phantom Menace,\" \"Forever\" is going up against expectations years in the making.  To come even close to matching them is an exercise in futility.  And in the light of hype, the only way Duke could ever hope to succeed was to focus on being a fun and enjoyable game.And I'm happy to report that, for the most part, Duke Nukem Forever succeeds.Taking place many years after the conclusion of the previous Duke Nukem game, \"Forever\" finds Duke doing what he always does:  Indulging his massive ego, grabbing all the sex he can from steamy college co-eds, managing his massive casino on the Las Vegas strip, and autographing copies of his book, \"Why I'm so Great.\"  However, one day, aliens once again come down to earth and start stealing all the hot babes.  In light of such an insult, Duke returns to action once more, to save Earth, preserve freedom, but most importantly...to save all the hot chicks.In many ways, \"Forever\" is a game that has seemingly traveled through time from the mid-1990's.  Aside from the obvious graphical upgrade, not much has changed since Duke's first 3D adventure...he runs, he shoots aliens and cracks one liners.  He does everything a shooter is supposed to do, but at the same time, \"Forever\" isn't really all that different from any other shooter you'd find on today's market.  The only thing that really makes it stand out is Duke himself:  Whether you love or loathe him, there's no denying that Duke is one of the most colorful personalities in the FPS genre, offering more humor and personality then Master Chief, Gordon Freeman (There are, of course, jokes related to the two in the game), or other countless FPS protagonists.In a way, this is the best part of \"Forever\":  It's a blast to see Duke's monstrously high opinion of himself (he even has a museum set up to immortalize how awesome he is), to hear his witty one liners, jokes, and watching other people react to him, which run along the lines of, \"Holy s*** it's Duke Nukem!  We're saved!\"  \"Forever\" doesn't take itself seriously at all, and offers a lot of juvenile humor, from strippers, giant breasts on the walls (that you can slap), to jokes about games in general; aside from the mentioned gags against Halo and Half life, you'll find references to Dead Space, Leroy Jenkins, annoying puzzles, and even hints that show up on loading screens (\"Take less damage to avoid being killed.\").  And if you read some of the items that show up in the game (sauce containers, boxes, etc.) you'll find descriptions that are laugh out loud funny (I loved the one about Oompa Loompas).Aside from the humor, \"Forever\" boasts some really creative missions and scenarios:  One of my favorites include occasionally being shrunk down and having to go through ordinary locations while being the size of an action figure, which can lead to massive gunfights between six inch tall enemies on kitchen shelves, complete with miniature guns and cans being tossed back and forth.  I also really enjoyed the driving stages, and the underwater sequences were certainly unique.  There are also some awesome set pieces, but I won't describe them, to avoid spoiling the surprise.Sadly however, humor and creativity will only take a game so far, and despite all the years in development, \"Forever\" still has some serious problems.Among Nukem's biggest problems isn't the graphics (which I thought were a bit plain in some areas, but were fine overall) or the story (which is bare bones, but it doesn't affect the game negatively), but rather, the difficulty, lack of direction, and annoying boss fights.  \"Forever,\" even on the normal difficulty setting, is a surprisingly tough game.  It's not impossible by any means, but as the game goes on, you're going to be bombarded by enemies who can kill you in a matter of seconds, and often show up in packs, which leads to a LOT of annoying deaths at the hands of annoying enemies, including pigcops, teleporting jet-pack wearing soldiers, and those damn octobrains.Leading into the difficulty is the boss fights.  While every boss you face is absolutely gigantic in size, most of them resort to cheap tricks and annoying strategies to make your life hell, such as sending several of their minions to battle you, as is the case with a boss battle that took place on a moving catwalk, which was almost impossible for me to beat, due to being killed very quickly.  It's a real shame too, as the second to last boss could have been one of the best fights I've ever gone through, but it's fast attacks make it more annoying then fun (Duke's painfully slow swimming speed didn't help, either).While the first half of the game is quite creative and clever in many ways, that feeling fades about halfway through, as the game recycles objectives (hunting for gas gets old quickly), and the game becomes a generic hallway shooter that has you going through concrete hall after concrete hall.  It doesn't help that there are some points where the game isn't clear on where you're supposed to go; there were several points where, upon completing an objective or receiving one, I wasn't given any hints on where to go, and would wander around for several minutes before finding a well hidden switch or ladder.  It never got to the point where I had to look at an online FAQ for help, but it was annoying.Still, despite these flaws, I did enjoy \"Forever.\"  While I did get really frustrated and annoyed at times, the charm and humor kept me going, as did the creative set pieces, and of course, playing as Duke (again voiced to perfection by Jon St. John) was a blast.  While the game doesn't have a whole lot of replay value (it does have some nice unlockables, though), I did enjoy my time playing through it, and once the game was over, I was satisfied.  Not ecstatic or disappointed, but satisfied.\"Forever\" is not going to innovate the gaming industry.  It doesn't have much to offer that's new, but the game fully embodies the macho spirit of the 90's, and knows what it wants to do:  To blow stuff up and have fun doing so, and for the most part, it succeeds.  It may not be all that great, but to me, it's at least worth a rental.  Let's just hope that the king is here to stay, and that his next adventure doesn't take over a decade to come out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

I've played many different types of stealth action games (Tenchu, Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, Hitman, Siren, Manhunt etc) and Thief - Deadly Shadows was on par with the best of them.  After finishing this title I'm now eagerly anticipating Thief 4.  While the game was not flawless it was very close.  Here are my thoughts on Deadly Shadows;Pros+ Great graphics, even by today's standards.  The lightning and shadow effects were perfect, particle effects were well done and character models were well detailed.  Even though it was released several years ago I was able to crank the graphics up to max and barely noticed any pixelation.+ Intruiging and well thought out story.  The writers should be commended on a rare and original storyline in a video game.+ Amazingly haunting and atmospheric score!  One of my all time favorites and has been on my iPod for years.  The track from Shalebridge Cradle was incredibly creepy and this isn't even a survival horror game.  A job well done by composer Eric Brosius.+ Superb voice acting.  All conversations were original and non repetitive.  It was great eavesdropping on NPC conversations to learn more about what's going on in the area.  The shop owners were also great each with their own unique personalities.  Many of the guard conversations made me laugh.  Some voices were recycled but the acting was so top notch it didn't matter.+ Original main character (Garrett the Thief).  I really enjoyed his story and backstory.  An all around great anti-hero to play.+ Decent array of thieving tools and gadgets complete with clever ways to use them.+ Interesting and unique faction system in the city.  Although only a few they were still excellent.+ Fluid character movement and combat.Cons- Terrible jumping bug.  There's a fair amount of jumping in this game (over ledges, on to walls, across rafters etc) but this bug was simply awful and it happened quite often.  Basically what happens is when you jump and land on the edge of an ledge or item you catch it and essentially become suspended in the jump animation.  Granted you can still slide around and attack but you can't turn or jump.  Very annoying and it seems to happen at the most inopportune times.  I did have the latest patch on the game but this bug still persisted.(Please keep in mind that the rest of my Cons listed are severely nitpicky and should by no means disuade you from playing the game)- Highlighting items for pick up was problematic.  The smaller they were the more difficult they were to see and pick up.  Especially items dropped from victims or in hard to manuever chests.- Wall climbing was a bit disappointing.  I didn't expect to be Spiderman but the wall areas you could traverse were quite limited.  And areas of the wall that you would think would allow you better gripping (window frames, ledges, roofs, wall tops, pillars etc) you couldn't grip or go around at all!  Of course this isn't Assassin's Creed or Uncharted but I did at least expect it to be similar to Tenchu Stealth Assassins where you could at least climb on to rooftops and traverse parts of the city that way.  Even the box art depicts Garrett as a rooftop bounder.- NPC's detection range of Garrett was very poor when close, even on higher difficulty settings.- Maps were somewhat confusing.  I seemed to struggle with locations on just about every map and I'm not map challenged.  A self marker (You Are Here) would have been helpful.- Unable to drop non valuable items quietly.  This was sort of a pain when you'd accidentally pick up something then drop it with a loud thud attracting everyone and their mother.-  A thief that can't swim is rather disappointing.  Now I understand the reasoning for puzzle solving and that's fine but instant death when you touch water?  It doesn't make much sense.- Inability to scroll backwards on your weapon selection only forward on the mousewheel.  Very problematic in times of panic against attackers.- The city as a whole felt too small and very constricted.  I know that might have been part of the feel and design to make it feel enclosed but it became difficult to move around when you had traffic jams of NPC's in certain areas with absolutely no way of getting past short of slaughtering the lot of them.While the game wasn't perfect it was very close.  If you enjoy stealth action games don't miss out on this one like I did on the first two!  A highly recommended title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"T. Sparks","summary":"The Start of the Series","reviewText":"&quot;Castlevania&quot; was one of the first games for the NES; as a result, you can expect somewhat stiff, challenging gameplay, placed in an extremely addictive formula.As Simon Belmont you are required to kill Dracula for some reason.  Although it wouldn't be explained WHY until Castlevania II, all you need to know for this game is that Dracula is bad and must die.  Dracula knows this, and so has a cast of minions at his disposal, including Medusa, Frankenstein, and the Mummy.Because the game was made in 1986, quite a few of the religous undertones were axed for the game.  Holy Water is called the &quot;firebomb,&quot; whereas the Cross is called the boomerang.  Still, everybody knew what these sub-weapons REALLY were.The game offers detailed graphics (for the time) as well as absolutely amazing music and sound effects (it took a lot of work on Konami's part to get Simon to grunt when he was hurt.)  The music for the first level has become a staple of the game series.The game, however, is hard.  Very, very hard.  The furthest I ever got was to the dungeon, right after you beat Frankenstein and Igor.  With no password feature, this means that you'll be playing the game for quiet some time before you fight Dracula--provided, of course, you ever get that far in the game.Still, a great game that deserves a place in any classic video game collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2003"}

The first area of the game was mind numingly boring, and the tutorial was way to long. However unlike alot of first impressions this was way off the mark.Once you manage to work your way through the first hour of dredgery  S.O. takes off like a freaking rocket. The storyline is very enganging and kept me playing well into the night. I usually don't play games much longer then an hour or so at a time but by the time i went to sleep after the first day of playing i already was a good 8 hours into it.A large part of the reason this game is so addictive is the near flawless combat system. For those you played star ocean the second story it's very similar - but with a much more realistic flow (a well timed attack by an enemy isn't going to result in a chain of 20 plus hits that are unavoidable - which sometime happened in the last S.O. game). Also timing your attacks becomes even more critical. With the combination of weak attacks (which are often blocked by a stagnant enemy) and much stronger but hard to land attacks (which can't be blocked if they connect) the game provides a substantial level of challenge (button mashing isn't going to work in this real time RPG) The boss fights provide alot of challenge and substance and simply are very enjoyable.If you enjoyed the sci fi elements of the last S.O. intermixed with the fantasy/medevil aspects then you will find more of the same here.So far i've enjoyed the latest installment of the S.O. saga even more then i did the last. The game deserves 5 stars because it delievers everywhere that it counts.Storline 10/10Combat 9/10Music  9/10Voice Acting 8/10Graphics 9/10Overall Enjoyment 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2004"}

It took me 5 hours and 17 minutes to complete. While I consider myself an above average gamer, I'm sure hardcore gamers can do it faster on their first try. Once I beat the game, I unlocked the \"unlimited ammo\" and \"one shot kill\" cheats. So I decided to play another campaign and it took under 3 hours to complete. It's like playing Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition with the Chicago Typewriter - it's just way too easy. Everything, I mean everything, dies in one shot. Even the huge gigantic alien bosses that used to take 6-7 radiation grenades.With that said though, this is still a fun game, and it does have some pretty tough moments. I think there are plenty of different weapons to try and use, including some that allow you to snipe from far away. There is no roaming the environment so you are pretty much stuck on your path to complete the next objective. I did find some of the data disks and hidden messages within the missions, but I don't really think it's worth trying to spend the time to find them all only to unlock the \"firey death\" cheat. Which basically means when you kill and enemy, they burn to the ground. Big deal?Overall, I would recommend this game if you are into first or third person shooters. It would be a great game to get while waiting for that next big game to come out and kill some time. It's pretty cheap, short, and it is fun. Actually, it might be better to rent this game instead of buying it as I have put about 8-9 hours into it and beat it twice already! And I don't think I'm going to play it again.This game reminds me of 007 Quantum Of Solace as it's cheap, fun, short, and easy with some tough moments and not much replay to it. I would still recommend this game for Wii owners since there aren't many great games for this system. Enjoy!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

You see all these 4 and 5 star ratings before my review and say this must be a fluke.It isn't. There are many people that are die hard loyalists of this series. No matter how repetitive this game is, they will always give it high marks.At first, I really thought this game was great. My first hour of play was exciting. Then the old faults and linear problems popped up like in the first edition of COD.Trust me, try playing F.E.A.R. and you will see how lame and outdated this game model is. $50 is way too much to spend on this game.THE BAD -1- VERY SHORT PLAY TIMEI finished this game on the veteran setting in under 7 hours. I sincerely was not trying to beat the clock. I like to take my time and savor every moment of a game. I was hoping it would last....it didn't.2- GRAPHICS ARE FAIRThe graphics engine is new in this sequel which is a blessing but you better have a fast CPU and VGA card my friends to get quality visuals! There are moments in this game when the rain, weather effects and large numbers of enemies are cranking out so hard on you that your processor or card will start to chug and vomit. Sure you can solve this problem by turning down the settings, but what is the point of a new graphics engine based game if you can't enjoy the beauty right????3- LINEAR GAMEPLAYOnce again...the COD developers have proven themselves to be the kings of linear/forced gameplay! What is linear gameplay? It means that basically, you only have one path to follow, and triggers spots to hit to change the gameplay. Example - Say you have to destroy 3 artillery crews. You have to follow down one particular path in a town, you must clear the buildings and the enemies don't stop coming at you until you clear out one artillery base. You basically spend this game rushing forward head first into every single battle, causing great frustration and it does get old and boring after the 5th time in a row. If you think your going to hide behind a wall, pick off the enemy and clear the building...your going to run out of ammo! In other words, you don't have a choice. Full speed ahead. In some cases that is fun and exhilirating. At other times, it sucks.You also know when enemies are going to hit you too. Linear game play is predictable. You attack an area, clear it, then move to attack the next target. As you approach, the enemies pop out ahead of you and get into formations. Lather, rinse and repeat....YAWN!!!!!4- AUTOMATED ATTACKSIn some of the battles, there are secure spots to hide in. However, once you're there, you'll get bombarded with grenades. I watched where they came from...lol No enemies are there, they just magically are thrown from the ground. This is to prevent you from taking advantage of shelter and once again...forcing you to run head first into the battle. LAME!!!5- NO HEALTH PACKSTHIS REALLY SUCKS! It has a new system. Instead of hunting down health packs to recover and fight on, you automatically rejuvenate! I could take bullet after bullet and not die. Ergo, there was no risk!!! No price to pay for being foolish. Here is how it works. An enemy pops up and pelts me with bullets. As I get hit, my health endurance goes down. If I don't take cover so I can recover, I will die. The screen starts to get more and more red as an indication of how close to death you are. Hide behind a wall for 5 seconds to recover and your good to continue.In some ways, this seemed like it was a neat idea to try. Overall, I think it is a failure. It was too easy for me to beat the game because I did not have to preserve my health levels. On the other hand, it was nice not to have to collect health packs. Still, it was too easy.6- CAN'T DISABLE THE STUPID MUSIC!!!Once again, Activision...in cooperation with their tremendous egos...has decided that they know best and you don't matter. So guess what...? You cannot turn off or turn down the music in this game. They repeated the same offensive tactic from COD. This is so annoying. The realism goes out the window when the music is so loud and intrusive that you cannot hear explosions or bullets! I am not joking...it is really that loud at times!However, I know software, so I hacked critical files in COD and I hacked COD 2 to disable the music! Up yours Activision! For other people that cannot do this...look around at some game cheat sites. I will be posting the instructions in HOW TO form.7- THIS IS BASICALLY COD and COD:UO in a DIFFERENT WRAPPER!Basically, if you have played COD or the expansion COD:United Offensive...you have already played COD2. Yes, it is that sad and that much of a let down. In fact, I honestly feel COD and COD:UO are better in a majority of ways.8- COMRADES GET IN THE WAYActivision still has not fixed the issue of your idiot squad mates not getting out of the way quickly! Nothing is worse than  entering a door and having the enemy lob 2 or 3 grenades at you. You try to get out the door but your moronic mates are just standing there blocking the door. BAM, POW....your dead! Start over and don't enter the building. Lesson learned!THE GOOD1- IT IS FUNI am not saying this game is horrible or not worth playing. I am simply saying it is not worth $50, it certainly has been done so there is nothing new or dynamic about this game that you have not felt in the original COD and that there are other games out there like F.E.A.R. that really will blow you away with creativity.This game does have its moments. I love WW2 FPS games.SUMMATION -This game was long awaited and could have been great. It turns out, that it is not that great. Been there, done that. No one made a hardcore effort to introduce something new and fresh to the FPS genre.Save your money and either wait for this to go below $35 or go buy COD and COD:UO and get 3 times the band foir your buck if you have not already played them or finally and definitely the best option...go buy F.E.A.R. or Quake 4. Both of those games are much better than this and will keep you happier for a much longer period of time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}

On the flip side, Jen doesn't wish to leave the reservation & her bar. So, after Tommy tries convincing her to leave & fails, and after he beats up two drunks, Aliens come and began invading the planet kidnapping everyone inside the bar and surrounding area. It's up to Tommy to save himself, his people, his girlfriend, and his world.Its a simple first person shooting game with a small armory of weapons which include an assault rifle, a heavy machine gun, rocket launcher, grenades, etc. However, all these weapons are \"organic weapons\" meaning that, for example, instead of it being a normal frag grenade its actually some small alien that you rip the leg off and throw so it blows up... in other words your ammo is living just like in Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. You must press buttons, crouch, jump, and all those goodes. Early in the game you are given the ability to have your spirit leave your body, who is equiped with a properly named \"Spirit Bow\", and run around through force fields and what not.What seperates Prey from other standard FPS? Well for starters you can walk on walls (which was pretty nifty even if it did give me vertigo) and it helps give way to fighting enemies - for instance sometimes you'll be shooting at them upside down. Secondly, you can rotate certain rooms by shooting these pads. Finally, when you die your spirit goes to some spirit realm where you can shoot these blue or red wraiths to regain health and after a little while you come back to life. Though that part was pretty cool and helped in some points, it really did take away from the challenge.Throughout the game there are these spore things on the floor that if you walk over them you regain a little bit of health. Ontop of that there are these health station things that give you more health then the normal spores.So what were it's problems you ask? Well, like I stated early you can always come back to life no matter what - even though it was cool, it made the game far too easy. Secondly, the game is pretty short - I had it beat in two days. Finally the ending was unrewarding: Tommy saves the world even though Jen dies, he goes to the \"Spirit World\" and talks to his dead Grandfather & Jen's souls, then you see Tommy rebuilding a bar that resembles Jen's and this alien chick walks into his bar (you meet her in the middle of the game) and she explains that other \"good\" aliens heard what he did and they want to meet him and a space portal opens up..and guess what? Tommy steps in and sets the stage for a Prey 2.I will admit, the idea of aliens coming to earth, taking humans and feeding them to their powerful leader is always a cool idea and Prey sure does it in a cool and violent way. You see bloody humans, you'll see humans cowering in dark corners mummbling to themselves from insanity, you'll see many humans being hunted and killed right in front of your eyes, hell you'll even see CHILDREN getting killed. So thats definitley cool and adds points thanks to the violence factor.As for online play, I don't have X-Box Live Gold so I can't review it. Sorry guys.The graphics are the same as Doom 3 or Quake 4.. so by now I'm not really impressed, and everything is pretty damned dark. Sure everything looks cool and half organic-half metallic, but it's an engine thats been used up. Use Oblivion's engine, then I'll be impressed.The music & sound FX were pretty right on. The guns sounded powerful and satisfying, and the music changed from actiony to Indianish when you went into your spirit mode. The best part about all this was the voice acting. Tommy had such personality and acted so real that I connected with him on a personal level, and the way he interacted with other characters was cool as well. Like for instance if you found a crazed human and killed him, Tommy says \"It's better that way friend.\" or sometimes when he gets hit he will curse. I liked it.To sum it up, I do not think this game was judged fairly. It has its moments of repetivity & easiness, but its really fast paced, has a cool story, the main character is almost as cool as Duke Nukem himself, its violent as hell, and the action is pretty awesome. I give it a solid 8 with a recommendation of renting it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001C58T46","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"An excellent platformer that reminds us all that the genre can still be done on consoles","reviewText":"Positive:+ 2-D cartoon graphics look very sharp+ solid gameplay with some great elements new to the series+ smooth controls that also don't over use motion capabilities+ tons of treasures and missions add a lot of replay value+ full of that funny, weird Wario personality and styleNegative:- main adventure is pretty easyWario Land was my favorite game from the original GameBoy, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a 2-D platformer as much as I enjoyed it. When I heard the series was going to Wii as a full retail game, though, I had my doubts about how worthwhile it would be at full price. 2-D games have been very overshadowed by 3-D in this generation, and now gamers (myself included) are starting to feel that 2-D games are inferior to those in the third dimension. Does Wario Land: Shake It only further push those assumptions or does it prove us wrong?Wario Land has a funny story, but it doesn't show up very often. Basically the Shake King has taken over the Shake Dimension, imprisoning all the cute little residents, kidnapping the princess, and taking the great treasure: a coin bag that always gives you coins when you shake it. The only one to escape this horrible occurrence (named Merfle) somehow finds Wario in his own dimension, going on with his normal daily life. Captain Syrup and Merfle enlist Wario's help in getting back the land, the princess, and most importantly the coin bag, and that's the last you hear about the story until you defeat the Shake King. Both the beginning and end cutscenes have the sheer comedy you would expect from a Wario game, and the greedy hero takes nothing seriously and always loses out in the end.The game progresses over the course of five areas, each with four levels and one boss. You have to beat one level to reach the next, but you can purchase the next area if you want to and have enough coins, so you can go through the game how you like. There may be only 20 main levels, but there are also lots of challenging bonus stages and each level (bonuses included) has three to seven missions and three treasure chests to find. I can guarantee you will feel inclined to go back and try to do more in the game than just beat all the levels, and to get everything you will have to play through each level a minimum of two times. So while there aren't a ton of levels, the ones available are worth replaying.Each level is very well designed in terms of playability. Getting through to the end is usually pretty easy, and after you reach the end of a level you have to get back to the beginning before time runs out, which almost turns into a fun minigame, actually. If you find the booster near the end of the level, you can take the fast way in which you are constantly running at high speed. Getting back to the start fast enough to clear the level's mission based on time involves many well-timed jumps, slides, and turns and can be quite challenging. So the levels are very well designed in terms of playability, because you have to be able to get through the normally and then there is a whole course set up for high speed.The level design complements the gameplay very nicely. Shake It plays like other 2-D platformers, you move left and right, jump, and all that, but Wario has always had the ability to charge as well, and now he also has an earthquake punch that can be used to stun enemies, solve puzzles, and other things. This is done with a shake of the Wii remote, a function that works quite well and isn't over used. The Wii remote can also be shaken to get coins out of coin bags, which is a nice feature in the gameplay. Motion control is also used for a few submarine levels as well as in a boss fight, and tilting the controller to aim for throwing enemies and for shooting Wario out of a cannon works quite nicely too. Overall the concepts, level design, and controls come together very nicely for a great gameplay experience.Shake It may be fully 2-D, but that's not to say the graphics don't look really sharp. They may not be stunning visuals like you see in Mario Galaxy, but it's about as good as you can possibly make a 2-D game look. The objects and characters aren't extremely detailed, but they look very smooth and sharp. The animations for all the actions look very nice too and add much to the humorous Wario feel. The level backgrounds look great too, and if you take a look, things such as large rocks will actually pop out in front of the level in some areas, but they don't obstruct your vision at all. Shake It displays some of the finest 2-D graphics I've ever seen, and they really add a lot to the overall experience of the game.Shake It sounds almost as good as it looks. The music tracks may not be the most memorable you've ever heard, but they sound really good and fit their respective environments very well. The sound effects are 100% Wario too, with funny sounds that have good quality.In a world where 3-D is most often hailed as king, Wario Land: Shake It stands tall and proud. It manages to be just as fun as most of the 3-D games out there and delivers an experience any fan of the series or platformer aficionado will love. 2-D CAN be worth full price, you just have to be willing to pay up.Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 9.0Sound: 8.5Camera & Control: 9.0Value: 8.5FINAL SCORE: 9.0/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2009"}

All my friends were foaming at the mouth for this, so I got it too. Ok lets get to it:1- Graphics subpar:  I dont know WHO did the artwork for this game, but it was DEFINITELY not the dudes from their SF Team. The Ultras, and backgrounds look awesome. The characters and movement just are not Capcom quality.2- Cant see online battles - WTF is this? This needs no more explanation. If you arent the one fighting, you just sit in the lobby...so train by yourself offline or get pwned until you learn online, no watching battles. at all. stupid.3- Cocaine and/or redbull mandatory - Button mash or get coked up. The speed needed to chain combos is just stupid.So now Im out $60 bucks until Capcom decides to nickel and dme me with DLCs to get the other half of this unfinished game.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"jong chung","summary":"This game is GREAT","reviewText":"No one messes with Mario's vacation!

I started the level at hardened, even though it covers one more level of difficulty above that. I found it very challenging and found myself having to repeat several missions.

Each game in the series set a standard for console and computer games that has changed the way today's player sees the RPG genre.I originally played FF8 in the PC version, so I was interested in how the PS2 version would compare.  Even with a my leaky memory, my impression is that the PS2 version is a bit solider graphically.  And, of course, the use of a game controller makes everything seem smoother, even if it really isn't.FF8 follows in the classic Final Fantasy mode - a team of characters headed by a serious minded leader, with a bunch of slightly wacky, but dedicated companions, take on an evil that seems to keep getting stronger and more capable with each advance of the plot.  No villain ever really seems to die, the keep coming back in new and deadlier forms.  And then there are the Guardian Forces, who provide all kinds of spectacle for the battles.This time it is Squall, his fellow SeeDs, and the beautiful Rinoa.  The story starts as a revolution, and then the characters discover that events are really being manipulated by a series of sorceresses who want to destroy the world so that they can rule it unchecked (I know that doesn't make any sense).  All of this on a giant world make full of monsters convenient for leveling up.And leveling up is certainly what a Final Fantasy game is about.  Various side quests and challenges are provided so that reaching the levels needed to kill the final bosses doesn't become tedious, and an incredibly complex character building system makes sure that everyone's playing experience is different.FF8 set a standard that is still higher than some games being written for the PS2 today, and managed to accomplish that on a more primitive platform.  Graphics and character design are amazing, the plot complex, and the action satisfying.  Proving that the best isn't always the newest and the loudest.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2003"}

This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Amazing potential yields....overall average game","reviewText":"Single Player: 2.5/5 StarsThis story picks off a few years after the first Modern Warfare ends.  This game is practically overflowing with amazing cinematic setpieces from one moment to the next.  The graphics are very good, and on my decent rig the framerate never dipped even in some of the more intense battles with lots of effects.  The gunplay is slick and the weapon choices are plentiful and satisfying with meaningful differences between the available weapons and attachments.  How then does it only get 2.5 stars out of 5?  The pacing and level design are terrible, and the plot becomes confusing, disjointed and ends with more loose ends than any other videogame I've ever played.I won't spoil the plot particulars, so lets go with pacing and level design.  Gone are the infinitely respawning enemies of MW1...and for that reason alone I thought the single player would be amazing.  Instead, they've replaced them with badguys that spawn (but in fixed amounts) surrounding you and with superior positioning.  To make it worse they are all crack shots (even when blindfiring around a corner), spam grenades and RPGs like parade confetti.It ruins the pacing and intensity of many of the missions.  The chase through the Rio Favela for instance looked like an intense high-paced battle.  Play it like that and you'll never see the end of the mission though.  Instead of running and gunning through it chasing down the target, you have to crawl through it cautiously as almost every corner you go around will present you with 10-15 new badguys that will hit you with every bullet they fire.Larger chaotic missions are even worse.  You'll be facing dozens of enemies at once.  It's supposed to be fair because you'll have other soldiers/squadmates, but you can't control/direct them, and they're virtually useless.  I say virtually because they do keep you from getting lost.  It's a videogame tradition to have your squadmates unable to hit the broadside of a barn with their weapons, meaning you do all the killing.  Infinity Ward keeps up with tradition here.  They also take away their other traditional role though: bullet sponge.  The enemies pretty much ignore your allies and only go for you.  It's an almost beautiful site in some of the bigger battles to see 9-10 RPG smoke trails and dozens of bullet tracers all converging on your position simultaneously while your buddies sit out in the open with all the care of an office-worker on a smoke break.Multiplayer: 3/5The loss of dedicated servers hurts this a lot.  Its not a deal-breaker that lowers it to one star like many others have rated it, but it is a significant mark against the game.  I actually don't mind the loss of custom maps/mods, etc so much.  It's problem is this: it removes a simple feature that PC gamers have had for about a decade: to reliably connect to a server, and find a server with decent ping.  Often-times you will get a server that has decent ping...but often enough (~1/3 of the time) you'll end up on some stuttering mess that's almost unplayable or completely unplayable (despite the fact that all players have \"full bars\"; actual ping numbers are not provided).  And that's only when you can connect to a game at all.  Numerous times I've been completely unable to connect to a game at all.There are other issues too.  A dedicated server allows for the formation of a loose community.  A consistent group of people that aren't necessarily on your \"friends\" list that will play with each other on a server.  You also lose the ability to kick & ban players that are disruptive, or those that are obviously cheating (surprisingly rare so far, but it will get worse as time goes on and Infinity Ward becomes less diligent in negating hacks).That being said, when you are on a good server, the game is fun and addictive.  The level of customization is fantastic.  Also, at least early on, you can't go 2 rounds without unlocking something new, which drives you to want to play more and more.  It makes the lack of dedicated servers all the more disappointing to know that such a great game is there, but the oftentimes you can't experience it because you can only find lousy servers.There are some weapon balance concerns: notably sub-machine guns seem incredibly weak, while other combinations (like dual shotguns) are a bit too powerful.  The majority of players use assault rifles and light mg's (myself included) which seem well-balanced.  Some perks are just too useful compared to others (Perk Slot #2, for instance, only has 2 truely viable choices).  I have hope that some of this will be remedied by future patches, but we'll see.Overall, the game is inconsistent.  The Single-player campaign has amazing pieces that are strung together with frustrating and un-fun combat.  The multiplayer has a phenomenal game that is hampered by being unable to be reliably served.  It's a disappointment not only coming from a developer of Infinity Ward's ability, but because there really is a 5-star game burried under a layer of poor decisions and lazy design.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}

Let's just say this game has better plot than most of novels in genre. It will make you laugh, cry, and even feel scared sometimes.Game begins in thrash horror-hellraiserish environment but I wouldn't call it a horror RPG. Sure, there are scary elements but there are also extremely humorous parts, although game is more serious than Arcanum,which is prank-based. Story has both phylosophical and absurd humour aspect, since in all games you have limited life points and here, you are immortal trying to fid out about himself.Characters are incredible: an anarchist who has to be loyal to main character, succubus who has bordel for INTELECTUAL lust, a floating skull who always gives ladies overgenerous comments and so on. Each of them is so impressive that communicating resembles talking to people you know from somewhere.Unlike many games, dialogue solves most of quests and Intelligence and Wisdom are much more appreciated here than in other RPGs. Fighting is intensive only at the end of game, so story is everything.Graphics look nice even today, after 12 years. The architecture and artwork are stylish and will never be outdated.Pick this up, it is maybe even better that Fallout (original sequels, not Betheseda's Fallout 3) and deeper than Arcanuum.EDITAfter slowly metabolising impressions about this game, I found out it is a story with a moral, or let's say short phylosophycal tale. If you want to play one RPG on PC, I am sure this is the one you need to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}

This is the true demonstration of the potential of the PS4, some of the moments in the game are simply breathtaking. The game controls like its predecessors, with some notable exceptions: the aiming is more tight in this game (not a bit loose like in Killzone 2 and Killzone 3), and the duck and cover system is automated (I found this annoying). The game seems to have lost its way in the first five chapters - the missions are more about sneaking than direct fire-fights, but at and after Chapter 6 the game becomes more like a true Killzone.

This game was an amazing ride that left me begging for more. The story is so well written, and the action complements it so well. The graphics are also pretty good. They are not amazing, but the grim green color of the game sort of hurts the graphics, but adds to the overall presentation of the game. The voice overs are spooky and mysterious. They really make you feel like you're a part of something bigger than yourself. This game also had great full campaign co op offline. This was a great touch that added the replayability to the title. This title should not be missed by anyone who loves the FPS genre; the sequel is a different story.Presentation- The menus and overall feel of the game is gloomy and gritty. This helps put the player into the fight as the human race fights to survive against the Chimera. They do however hurt the graphics; they should have been a bit brighter in places. The cut scenes are also well done as well as the music and sound effects. 4.5/5Graphics- As I said above the grittiness of the game hurt the overall feel of the graphics. They could have been better, but they did look good in cut scenes where the grittiness was not as prevalent. 4/5Story- The story is where Resistance really shines. The voice overs are an excellent way to narrate Hale's journey. The characters are woven into the campaign very seamlessly and you connect to each one. There is a great deal of mystery that adds to the fun of the campaign. Finding out what happened or will happen to Hale was a great adventure. 5/5Game Play- The use of different rings to hold your weapons is ingenious. I love to hold all of the weapons in the game, and harder difficulties give you more weapons. The only gripe I have is that the enemies seem to take a few too many hits. They should be dead after a few headshots. 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- This game is a treasure. The only sad part is that the sequel was so disappointing, that sort of hurt this game, and the franchise. I have beaten it five times. This game has a great replay value. I recommend this title however, I don't recommend the sequel. 5/5Overall 4.6/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

I hooked it up and bought two games (both reviewed on amazon! so check it out!) and was gaming for HOURS! I do not regret my choice, as there are more games I could ever play! Oh, and I love the price cuts on the older games, such as Bioshock for 19 bucks! and NBA 2K10 for Thirty Bucks even! GOOD quality games that I absolutely love.

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages.

There's always somebody condemning the popular well-made game because it's \"overrated\" (which by the way, is quickly becoming the quickest way to complain rather than detail why) and the occasional game that was taken apart by critics yet you go \"oh come on, that game was pretty fun, what's the deal?\" However, what do you do when that game is \"Sonic Unleashed\", another entry in the malighed 3D Sonic games which by all accounts, haven't been good since the days on the Dreamcast and coming after the colossal failure of \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"? Well showing mild reluctance, I decided to give the game a shot with the hope it will surprise me. And you know what, it did...that is not entirely but it did.Story: Just like Bowser, Eggman can't seem to take a hint and he's still up to trouble so up in space (in a fantastic FMV cutscene), Sonic does battle with his minions only walks into a trap: Sonic's Chaos Emeralds are drained of energy and wreaks havoc upon the Earth and literally tears it in pieces. Side effect is that by night, Sonic now turns into a clawed, furry beast named a Werehog so with the hope of his buddy Tails and new support character Navi...sorry, Chip, Sonic has to put the world back together.Graphics: My previous Sega game was \"Nights: Journey into Dreams\" on the Nintendo Wii which I felt looked stunning and colorful and this game is no different. Colors are vibrant, animation is pretty consistent and the speed is stunning. FMV's are particularly amazing and the in-game cutscenes look pretty good too. Only problem is that sometimes during the daytime races, the rings, traps and general level layout make it difficult to avoid missing the rings or hitting spikes that came up too quick. But other than that, the game looks great in HD.Sound/Music: Anyone who's played Sonic games when they introduced voice knows how generally painful they were to hear. Well in this game, hearing that there was Japanese, I went straight to it and it was actually pretty alright, considering. While Chip is young sounding, the voice acting never becomes ear-closing like the English ones. And thankfully, Sega did the same thing with Nights and actually did a orchestral score which is thankfully worth listening to. Some tracks don't gel and don't really do anything but the big dramatic numbers work well. And of course the ring and checkpoint sounds are the same which also brings up nice nostalgic moments.Gameplay: Many games over the years have always tried to add variety to keep you from becoming bored. Whereas previous Mario, Sonic and the like titles were standard 2D platformers, the 3D stuff always tries to add more and more and in Sonic Unleashed it comes down to 2 gameplay modes: the daytime where Sonic runs his blue self as quick as he can and the nighttime where he's a beat-em-up werehog. The daytime levels are to be blunt, fast as hell, and when things get going, that energy and speed of previous games return only there's a price in that it makes it that much harder to avoid traps and more than once I ran into spikes or tripped causing a decrease in speed and naturally, you're graded at the end so if you're not a fast little bugger, be prepared to get at best a \"C\". Trial-and-error or just blind luck are the key ideas here and worse, hidden in the levels are medals and when you're travelling at no pun intended, supersonic speeds, missing these things is quite easily done.The other is the werehog levels where Sonic travels through levels beating up bad guys with DMC or God of War-style combo chains and it somewhat works but it's quite repetitive however the biggest complaints are really 2 things. One, they're a bit too long with some lasting 20 minutes and to spend that long brawling is a bit buzzkilling. The other is that to kill enemies faster and with cooler skill points you gotta do the ol' quicktime events and there's not a whole lot of button presses for some but the problem is the speed. Imagine a button coming up as well as a timer where you have to hit the buttons as quick as you can lest you take damage and enemies gain some of their health back. Now imagine a timer that's wildly inconsistent where it'll either be slow and manageable and other times will be a missed button press because the time it took to move your thumb to the right button and press it was not fast enough. It made quite a few encounters trying but then again, they've always been like this in games. The camera woes are back as well where the camera will sometimes change to new angles and mess you up and you're like \"gah, let me see what I'm doing!\" but at least the platforms aren't as far and thin as other games but it's still a gripe.So with near damning reviews available to read on websites, does Sonic Unleashed require an ignore; a pass because of its awfulness? Not quite. It's not quite a perfect Sonic adventure but it's not the travesty some claim and it's certainly better than the last outing. Give it a shot but this isn't an unjustly maligned gem nor awful to the extreme, it's just in the middle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"Walter Reade","summary":"Better to rent","reviewText":"Nice graphics, a few exciting moments, and kinda cute.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"C.

The graphics are the best of any game on any system, and the atmosphere and enemies are horrifying! The way the designers put together Resident Evil is fascinating! It's terrifying to be in a small room, in a pitch black area, and hear the pants-wetting zombie groan, but you can't see the walking monstrosity. Talk about first class fear! After playing this game for a few hours, you'll be afraid to do anything for fear of being eaten alive by mutations or being bitten by the enormous mansion-dwelling creepy-crawlies. Only problem with this game is the puzzles, and the hours that you can spend doing trying to solve them. Also, having to restart is a big problem. You can't save your game every three minutes because of the scarce ink ribbons and typewriters. This game begs for a save anytime feature. Above all, buy this game.

Every 10 minutes there's a new monologue from our anti-hero, in his drone, monotonous voice, and it really gets tiring.I got about halfway through this game and gave it up because it gave me a headache. Between Max's incessant bitching and the loading times, I was less than stoked about this game.All in all, this isn't a game I would recommend for purchase; even for diehard Max Payne fans. Rent it, and then if/when the same thing happens to you, you won't get angry about the $60.00 you would have wasted otherwise.***UPDATE***After playing the campaign in it entirety, I want to voice my frustration with this game just a little bit more. This game is 10% gameplay and 90% cutscenes.What pisses me off the most is, when you see the final piece of a Golden Gun, you kill all enemies so there's no opposition, and whilst walking to pick up said piece -- WHOOPS!, you've magically transported to the next stage of the level, or completed the level completely; and, of course, there's no going back, unless you start the WHOLE level over.I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me. Normally, when you're going to progress to a new level, there's something indicative of a level change; a door maybe, or a switch of some sort. But no... In Max Payne 3, you can be walking toward the final piece of a Golden Gun and, without warning, you're on to the next stage; no opening of a new door, no triggering a new switch, just \"too bad, so sad, guess you won't be obtaining that Golden Gun trophy/achievement until next playthrough.\" That is, if there is a \"next playthrough.\" In my case, however, that's highly unlikely.But, I digress...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

While I appreciate there is a decent length single player campaign, I have a lot of issues with it.First, graphically R3 just can't compete with the heavyweights in its class- drab, ugly colors which the series just can't seem to shake, low quality textures that give the game a kind of blurry look, and the framerate is plain laggy. I just don't find much interesting about this series anymore- the story, or the characters. And I never could get over why they made Joseph so ugly/weird looking- such a strange design choice.Gameplay-wise, I found the controls to be sluggish in an age where games that rule the genre (like Modern Warfare) have such crisp, responsive controls- R3 just can't compete with them. The game's single hook- weapons that level up- just doesn't feel like anything special- I had no desire to go back into the game to max out all my weapons. A big gripe I have is the inconsistency in placing markers- sometimes it tells you where to go when it's obvious, other times it doesn't tell you anything when it should- in one of the later levels, I ran around in circles in frustration until I had to look up a video online to show me where to go. It was that I never got close enough to a console for the prompt to appear onscreen- just terrible design.There are a few fun levels that do have a little thrill factor, but overall Resistance is becoming increasingly irrelevant. I think Insomniac should move on to a new project and let this series go. I was turned off enough by it that I didn't even care enough to try multiplayer, that says a lot.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

I won't waste time with mentioning all of that since its been covered nicely. There are a couple of areas that needs tweaking though....First, the inventory system. In the first game it was terrible and needed fixin. But I think BioWare went too far with their \"Fix.\" Essentially they got rid of inventory altogether. I think the fans just wanted a system for sorting that made more sense, they didn't want it taken away. I actually like the new system, aside from one big problem, which brings me to the next point....The resource management system needs work. I'm ready for my assault on the Collector base. I've done EVERY mission I can so I've earned close to the maximum amount of money. Even though I've maxed all my uprades with research, there are still a few that can only be purchased at the stores. The problem is I don't have any money and there is NO way for me to make more. To maker matters worse, I'm sitting on nearly a million units of resources that I can't do anyting with. If you could trade them or sell them then you'd have a pretty nice economic system, but the way it is doesn't make a lot of sense. Here I am working for Cerberus, who can afford to drop 4 billion to bring me back from the dead, but I can't scrounge up enough money for a couple of 90k upgrades for the final fight.All in all a great game. I love the characters and I love that you don't ALWAYS have to have a certain type of character with you, like you did in the first game--techs. If you didn't have someone with tech ability, you were screwed, and there weren't many people with that skill. Grab the game and get ready for some fun.

In order to get this achievement without importing a ME1 save, one has to play through ME2 twice. I will cut to the chase and say I really liked ME2, but not enough to play through it again immediately and possibly not on the Insanity difficulty (to get yet another achievement). The default actions from ME1 include Wrex dying on Virmire, and the Alliance Council being led by humans with Udina as the ambassador. When I finished ME1 on the PC, Wrex was alive, and the original Council was saved with Anderson being the ambassador.Initially, managing 5 resources gets very tedious as your character can't afford to do research or buy upgrades without resources like credits, element zero, iridium, platinum, and palladium. Once you use probes to obtain these resources on planets (once you get to about 50k for element zero and 150k-200k for the metals, you can stop) it isn't as big of a problem but obtaining upgrades still requires credits. Playing through ME2 once, my character was still about 3000 experience points away from level 30 (which would have yielded another achievement) even though I explored every single planet and completed every side mission I could find. Managing the fuel and probes for the Normandy while exploring star systems was something I would have eliminated. It was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the gaming experience. Once you run out of fuel, EDI uses some palladium to tow your vessel back to the mass relay - not a big loss to be honest.The use of thermal clips is somewhat of a pain because in the later and more difficult stages, you quickly run out of thermal clips. Even with the Revanant Light Machine Gun (which has lots of ammo), I ran out at the final boss and had to finish him off with the pistol. In ME1, your weapon has unlimited ammo and just has a tendency to overheat which requires a cool down period. In ME2, you use thermal clips which in effect is ammunition.The mini-games are an improvement over those of ME1, but they are still tedious and waste time. They net you mostly credits with the occasional upgrade, and are often used to continue the mission (door, computer, etc...) The data hacking and bypass games require matching icons or screenshots.The Hammerhead is gone, and in its place is a shuttle that you can't fly/control. The Firewalker DLC gives you a hovertank, which is easier to control than the ME1 Hammerhead. I hear there is a ME2 DLC that gives you the Hammerhead.There are several DLC that have their own achievements, which makes it impossible to have 100% achievement completion unless you pay for the DLC. Adding up the cost in Microsoft points to purchase these DLC add-ons, it is the same price as the full game and the DLC just add a few side-quests. The Lair of the Shadow Broker has received high ratings, but I am not about to pay that much to find out.I also enjoyed the music soundtrack from ME1, which is sorely lacking in ME2. The ME2 music is typical video game stuff, while ME1 reminded me of the movie Blade Runner. Many of the main planets/stations are significantly smaller than the ones in ME1. For instance, the Citadel is now basically Zakera Ward and Captain Anderson's office in the Presidium! Tuchanka and Illium are major planets, yet your character only gets to visit one tiny portion of each area.Besides the DLC achievements, 2 achievements that require a lot of time/patience to obtain are the long service award (unless you import a ME1 save) and completing the game in insanity difficulty.The voice acting in ME2 is top notch! Martin Sheen is the Illusive Man, Yvonne Strahovski (Agent Sarah Walker from Chuck) is Miranda and Miranda is even modeled to resemble Yvonne, Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother from Full Metal Jacket, Colonel Casey from Chuck) is a Quarian commando leader, Claudia Black (Pitch Black, Farscape), and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity from Matrix) are just a few of the celebrities that lended their voices for the game. I noticed that the Collectors resembled Pilot from Farscape. And yes, I did look up interviews of Yvonne on YouTube to hear her real Australian accent!The controls are intuitive, and the AI isn't too bad. Your squadmates generally obey your orders but sometimes get in the way or enjoy getting killed by disobeying your commands. The loyalty factor in your teams is a good touch but it starts to get confusing when you have such a large team. I liked how a Geth joins your team, and there are more options for relationships in ME2.Pros: Fixed a lot of the issues I had with ME1, intuitive controls, easy inventory and upgrade system, excellent voice actingCons: Too many resources to manage, thermal clips, mini-games are annoying, DLC add-ons are rather expensive and have their own achievements, lack of good music to set the mood, there's no way to port my ME1 PC savegame to ME2 Xbox. I know this is a silly request, but doing a Google search shows a lot of people asking the same thing.Overall: 4/5 stars! If you're into RPG's like Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, but also enjoy Sci-Fi, and  3rd-person shooters, definitely play Mass Effect 1 and 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

I personally liked how they revamped some of the old school mario music and added some twists.Controls: Take a little getting used to at first because of the gravity mechanics in the game but they work very nicely. Mario 64 veterans will pick them up very quickly.Challenge: This was the one area that I had a little bit of a problem with. The game can be beaten with relative ease (Easier than 64). Even most of the levels that you don't have to play to beat the game are not all that difficult. However, once you beat the game, there are stages that have you collect 100 purple coins in order to get the star. Many of these levels were extremely difficult. \"Luigi's Purple Coins\" level in particular brought me to my knees! So the challenges are there if you want them but they are not required.Gameplay: This is a very fun game to play.

{"product_name":"B000SH3XD6","description":"Conan is an all-new action combat game featuring a story of adventure, true evil, and brutal, visceral combat. The game follows the journey of Conan the Cimmerian as he fights an epic battle against a variety of enemies and an elusive evil power that threatens to consume the world. Using anything and everything at his disposal, including hand-to-hand weapons, objects in the environment, and powerful elemental magic, Conan takes the fight to his enemies across the massive continent of Hyborea.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Gift-wrapped naughtiness","reviewText":"First of all: BOOBIES!Normally, I'm not about mindless things. Conan is entirely, indelibly mindless. The game is non-stop violence-flavored ice cream with a thick swirl of scantily-clad, bare-breasted \"maidens\" that \"heal\" Conan with a \"kiss\". All of the stages are beautifully rendered, and a lot of the bosses can be taken down with little effort once you learn their strategies on your first or second playthrough. And it doesn't take part-time job hours to beat, nor is it too short. It's just right.There are a few major annoyances to the game. For example, I'm a completionist but I don't like it when games force multiple playthroughs to get all achievements. Conan requires at least 3, since it only unlocks the top two difficulties when you complete the game on the previous setting. However, each level of difficulty you beat grants you a new cheat, and activating them does not prevent you from getting most achievements. If you enable the cheat to unlock all moves at the beginning of the game, you can't actually go through the process of learning them which means you don't get the achievements for learning all the moves of each category, but it's not hard to earn these before your final playthrough. Overall, the way it was done makes the second two playthroughs quick and mostly painless (unless you really screw up), which allows the game to be completed in just the right amount of time with just the right amount of satisfaction.So the final two playthroughs go by a lot quicker than you'd expect. It also helps to understand blocking. Unlike a lot of other action games which seem to believe in commit-or-die, Conan lets you immediately cancel almost any action by pressing the block button.SPOILER: blocking is super helpful when facing certain enemies that auto-block (it literally is an auto-block; the AI will start blocking before Conan even starts his attack animation). When normal enemies auto-blocks like this, they ALWAYS counter. Since the block stuns Conan for a moment, the painful follow-up, high-power counterattack can be annoying until you realize that you can stop any attack of your own by blocking. If you feint an attack and immediately cancel it with a block, the AI will auto-block, then follow up with its predestined counter. If you timed your block right, you'll get quick time event that gives you a chance to perform a nasty, messy and (usually) instant-kill counterattack. Once you get all of the timings right, you can breeze through every non-Boss enemy in the game by feinting an attack, blocking and countering.However, there are a number of unblockable attacks including most of the final boss' arsenal. You'll learn to identify these by the \"charge-up\" sound and a flash of color that appears on the enemy's weapon. There are a few battles where the boss has a frustrating skew of power over weakness, but careful thought and NOT mashing buttons will see you through it. The final boss has a mean set of moves that are far-ranged, mostly unblockable, VERY difficult to dodge, and many of which track you (all of which make me very angry under normal circumstances because I think it shows lack of skill on the developers' part). To boot, you're forced to give up all of your powers before the final phase of the battle, so the cheats are rendered useless. Also, this guy does not auto-counter after blocking so the feint-and-counter tactic doesn't work at all. This is to say: it is very hard to NOT get hit during this fight. On the highest difficulty setting this can be extremely upsetting as your health bar disintegrates. You have to stick and dodge your way through the fight and hope you have enough health to last through the final phase. It took me about two hours of repeatedly retrying the very last scene (I had about 10% of Conan's health bar going into it), but after so many repeats I finally learned the pattern and was able to beat the guy without taking more than one hit. It was frustrating, but also made me feel dumb because I should have been paying more attention sooner. I beat him way too quickly in the first two playthroughs when health didn't matter as much, and didn't know how to keep myself alive on that final one. Oh well.All in all, the game is just a delicious blood-soaked carnage that rampages through a lot of different, beautifully-detailed arenas. Oh... and BOOBIES! Definitely worth the price tag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Phoj","summary":"Great combat, bland story","reviewText":"What sets this game apart is very much the combat. It is fast paced which allows for multiple combo attacks in various settings with many different weapon types.The destiny idea as far as character class is also an innovative and fun approach to an rpg. You have three prime stat's you distribute points to as you level up, Might, Finesse, and Sorcery.  The talent tree's you have invested in allow you to pick what you want to be, for example a sorceror, warrior, or rogue. The cool idea is that you can spread your points to multiple tree's for example might and sorcery have their own unique classes such as Battlemage, or Paragon.  Each of these classes catagories have special bonuses and extra abilities they get such as a teleport dodge - Blink.The art is somewhat cartoonish, but it's not exactly terrible.The largest criticism I have for Kingdoms of Amalur: Recoking would be the easily forgotten story, as well as having no real attachment to any of the game characters.  I rarely do this, but I found myself skipping most conversations, they just had no real interest to me. You might ask, \"How do you know what to do if you skip what is going on?\" Well th eanswer is that their is quest tracking which puts a big dot on where you have to go.This game is very similar to Oblivion and Skyrim,just with less depth, but much better combat, as well as an unexciting story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"eau","summary":"Great guitar/bass learning \"game\"","reviewText":"I don't own the original Rocksmith game so I can't evaluate how the new Rocksmith 2014 Edition compares to it. However, from what I've heard, the 2014 Edition is a significant improvement over the original in both the user interface and the functionality of the \"game\".I used to learn to play guitar years ago and then kind of lost interest in it after finding it difficult to continue (not as rewarding as the amount of time I spent on it). Maybe it was the wrong kind of learning and classes that I took. I wasn't sure. Anyway, after acquiring a copy of the Rocksmith 2014 with the Real Tone cable, I dug out my old guitar and gave it a try. I'm glad that I did.Rocksmith 2014 isn't really a \"game\" but more of a learning tool. It teaches you from the very basic to the experienced levels, not matter when your guitar/bass skills are at (unless you are one of the legendary players). It offers plenty of lessons and practices at the end of each lesson. I've played the likes of Guitar Hero and Rockband, which is more of a rhythm playing simulator using the colored buttons on a fake guitar. With Rocksmith, you hooked up a real guitar and play real tones. That's as real as it gets.The user interface of the 2104 edition is intuitive and easy to use. Load time is fast and I've found myself playing more than navigating through the interface and waiting for the stuff to load. There are quite a number of features such as Lessons, Session Mode, mini-games, etc but the best of the bunch I like the most is the Riff Repeater. Riff Repeater allows you to select a specific segment of a song and customize it (speed, difficulty, etc) so that you can learn to play it gradually at your own pace.I've found learning through Rocksmith 2014 is very rewarding. I guess it's the fun factor that keeps me playing, rather than giving up because I felt frustrated and couldn't get nowhere close to playing a real song. Well, I'm still a terrible guitar player (headphone helps, for the sake of other family members) but I'm still learning, and best of all, I have fun doing it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

I like to think of it as Square holding this game out in front of you going &#34;Hey, look LOOK We can still make RPGs... no no don't look at FFXIII look at this.&#34; This is of course not true, but it's funny in my head. The game is Final Fantasy down to every last drop, the only thing it's missing is Chocobos, Mogs, and the words &#34;Final Fantasy&#34; in it's title. Let's go through the FF Checklist shall we?1. Party of characters that have no business having the power of gods because they are like... 17. Check2. Hair styles that require at least 1 gallon of hair gel a day? Check3. Classes and Spells that only Square uses (Fira, Blizzaga, etc...). Check4. Final Fantasy Items: Hi-Potions, X-Potions, Ethers, Turbo Ethers, Antarctic wind etc... Check5. &#34;Multi-hits&#34; (when you attack it says 4-hit) Check6. &#34;Limit Breaks&#34; of some kind? Check7. Airships? Duh! Check8. Final Fantasy jobs? Let's see... Black Mage, White mage, Red mage, Monk, Ranger, Summoner... CHECK8. Four Elemental Crystals that serve as the centerpiece for the world making it run in harmony until one day something shadowy and/or evil happens to them that requires a party of unlikely heroes to band together and make the crystals shiny again... CHEEEEEEEEEECK.Ok now that we've established that this is Final Fantasy V-2 (May as well be). ON WITH THE REVIEW.I'm going to say this right out of the gate. If you have any desire and I mean ANY slight liking of turn based JRPGs, and you have a 3DS. Get this game. Now. If you don't have a 3DS, go buy one and get this game. The amount of things in this game is astonishing and it's just a blast to play, while at the same time it feels like a mixture of modern and older mechanics... weighted more to the older side. I'm going to section out this review so if you are interested in the story or combat you can skip to those sections. Not what I USUALLY do but I'm feeling different today. I have not finished the game but I am at the end of chapter 2. That may not seem like far but that's like... 20 hours already. I've had enough time to get a grasp on the games existence!StoryI can't rate a story until I've finished it, and even then it's not really a ratable thing. However, I can say that it's at least so far interesting. The following is not a spoiler, unless you count what you learn in the first like... 20 minutes a spoiler. The world is held together by 4 Elemental Crystals, Water, Fire, Wind, and earth. Each crystal has a vestal that keep the crystal all shiny and happy through prayer (It's the games religion. Crystalites or something I believe it was called). One of your 4 party members is the Vestal of wind, Agn&egrave;s (pronounced on-yes... not kidding). In the opening video we see bad things happening, some sort of shadow has taken over the crystals. Gee... haven't heard THAT one before... Meanwhile Tiz's entire village is reduced to a giant hole. The goal, as far as I can tell, is to go around the world and restore the 4 crystals. *Ahem* Totally not FF1 or FFV.While you are on this task, another major power called the Bloodrose Legion (I believe) is trying to stop you, since they are anti-crystals and think that the world should be better off without them, yet the second the crystals stopped working the world... more or less died so I'm not sure what logic they are using. Either way the story does what it needs to do, it provides a way to get from Point A to Point B and it actually does something I approve of, it doesn't get in the bloody way. Not once since this started has there been a GIANT gap of story, and by that I mean you finish a task and you spend the next 2 hours listening to people talking about this and that. The talking scenes are quick, they get to the point for the most part, and don't get boring. Just goes to show Square can still tell a story without it being 8 feature length films. With some gameplay in between.CharactersAgain, can't really rate this one. The four main characters all have a distinct personality.Tiz, the cliche hero... I mean Shy Farmer, witnessed a terrible cliche... I mean his village being destroyed, and joined up with the Vestal of wind in the hopes of restoring his village. He is a quite type that is willing to protect his friends yadda yadda yadda. Walking. Talking. Cliche.Agn&egrave;s, or as I like to say dear god please stop talking now my EARS ARE BLEEDING (more on that later). She is the Vestal of Wind and has been tasked with fixing the worlds problems, despite everyone hating her in nearly every town I seem to go to. Then they like her once Agn&egrave;s and the gang fixes something. Silly non-believers. She is innocent, having spent her entire life away from the common-folk and doesn't know a darn thing about what goes on in the world.Ringabel, the games other male character. He has, and stop me if you have heard this one before, Amnesia! he can't remember anything, but he does have a journal that seems to be detail everything that happens before it happens and serves as a plot device constantly. He is also a self-proclaimed ladies man and hits on pretty much every female in the area around him. He has some great lines though even if most of the time you want to kick him in the back of the head.Edea, Actually I saved the best for last as she is by far my favorite character in this game. She betrayed the army she was with to protect Agn&egrave;s and has probably got some of the best bits of dialog in the game, particularly when talking to Ringabel who has fallen in love with Edea.So there you have it, 2 walking Cliches and 2 characters that have a bit of spirit to them. They work well and have a nice synergy about them. I enjoy their interactions from Agn&egrave;s's cluelessness to Ringabels... idiocy and Eda calling Ringabel out on it.By far my favorite line in the game thus far has been:Ringabel: &#34;I know, I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure it out.&#34;Edea: &#34;Oh? Perhaps you aren't hitting the wall hard enough, here let me assist you&#34;Dunno why, but it makes me laugh!Voice Acting - 2/10OK... so I've described the main characters and they are fine and all but I'm going to touch on what I believe to be the most painful part of this game... it's voice acting. I don't say this lightly, but it is among the worst voice acting I have ever heard in a video game to date. There are worse examples in other games (Maro maro from Blue Dragon for example) but, on the whole this entire game's VAing is bad. I even rate Star Ocean 4's voice acting above this and THAT is saying something.Agn&egrave;s has got by far the worst voice, it's grating, annoying, breaks constantly and just is all around unpleasant. Couple that with the fact that the sound quality of the game is so compressed it's just sad and you have an unpleasent experience. Ringabel and Edea actually have decent voices at least, they have emotion, and sound higher quality for some reason. Those Actors were trying. Some of the enemies also have decent voices, while others have ungodly terrible voices. I switched it to Japanese to see the difference and it just created a different world of issues, some voices got better while others got worse but at the same time the quality was still bad so I switched it back to English.I almost want to recommend playing the game with the voices off (you can mute them specifically) but at the same time I feel that would take a bit away from the game, because at least Ringabel and Edea have fun things to say and they say it well, so... worth it. If I could mute Agn&egrave;s I would. Without question. I know they had to compress it because of the 3DS but... come on... you may as well not recorded half of it and saves some space there.Customization 10/10 - This is split into 2 seperate systemsJobsThrowing back to the FFV days, Square decided to reintroduce the Job system... and I could NOT be happier with this. The game calls it the Asterisk system but... I find that ridiculous so I'm going to call it the job system since they are actually called Jobs in the game anyway... I think they are just confused.The game has something like 23 or 24 different jobs that each character can be. As you defeat enemies you get both EXP and JP (Job Points). Jobs have levels and you advance them by gaining these job points. Each level will unlock either a new job skill or a new job ability. For Example a black mage unlocks tiers of magic as their skills. Level 1, 2, 3 etc... black magic. But that's not all they get, they also obtain abilities like Immunity to silence, Reduced damage from Lightning, etc... these abilities and skills can then be used for other jobs. So if I switch the Black mage to a white mage, I can set their secondary skills to be black magic. Now I can cast both White and Black magic as my White mage. The abilities are also interchangeable, by the end of the game you get 5 ability slots, each ability takes X number of slots (from 1 - 3 I believe) and each does something different. For instance monks gain +10% HP for 1 point, +20% Hp for 2 points and +30% HP for 3 points, combine that with the knights  + 20% physical Defense and you can make an impressive tank character. Or combine 2 Handed (Wield a weapon with 2 hands for double attack power) and +20% Physical Attack on a spell fencer for some massive elemental Damage.The combinations are vast and for me have been really fun to mix and match. I'm up against a boss right now that I can't beat just yet because of one attack it uses that deals massive water damage, so I'm working on unlocking abate water (50% reduced damage from water sources) so I can withstand that assault. The jobs, leveling them, unlocking skills and abilities keeps me interested far more than I thought in this game, and the only wish I had was that I had more characters in my group to try more combinations!You actually don't unlock the jobs through the main story line either, at least not all of them. So far apart from the first few I got as part of the tutorial, all of my jobs have been unlocked through side quests... and these aren't simple tiny side quests they are actual quests. There is trouble in town and you have to figure out what it is! I won't spoil the story but the first 2 side quests I took unlocked 4 more jobs for me to use. So getting all the jobs in the game is going to be fun. At this time I have 11 unlocked I believe. Ranger being my favorite, because it does MASSIVE damage and knows the weakpoints of most of my enemies... and I can use those skills on my other jobs so imagine having all those 1.5x damage skill, then switching to a spell fencer, enchanting your sword with fire and the 2 handed ability, then attacking a plant monster who is weak to fire with the ability that deals 50% more damage to plants... ooooh it's going to be a dead plant!SpecialsSo this game has something similar to limit breaks from FFVII, they are called Specials. You unlock them as the game progresses (more on this later) but you start with a couple in the beginning. Each weapon type has a few specials attached to it and various ways with which to trigger it. The Rod for example requires you to deal damage with magic spells 10 times, and it's special is a single target laser beam that deals heavy damage to 1 opponent... but that's not all. Each special has a secondary buff that is granted to your party for a few turns. So the rod's special also grants +20% additional Magic Damage for a few turns to the whole party. For another example, the Bow requires you to deal weak point damage to enemies 10 times (Rangers are good at that). The attack does massive damage to 1 enemy and raises your parties crit rate by 400% for a few turns... while also looking awesome. There are also support specials like Rejuvenation that heals the party etc... or buff the party and keep everyone protected.Now you may ask why this is under the customization section, well that's because the specials are customizable! As you progress through rebuilding the village (More later on this) you unlock abilities that you can equip to your specials. For instance you can make your special Water based, or Fire based, make it do more damage to plants or Dragons, have a higher crit rate etc... This can be a good and bad thing because it does require a bit of planning. I went into a boss fight with a special that actually healed the boss because it was water based and I forgot to switch it for lightning. But I think it's still awesome how we can change them, make them a little more ours... and not just with abilities. You can rename them! I renamed everything to try and include badger in the title. So Hack and Slash became Badger Strike. Rejuvenation became Badger's Light etc...You can also customize what your characters say when they use the specials. Slightly limited to like... 15 characters but still it's a nice touch. I know it's a nitpick but I would like to have my character say the line while attacking not afterwards. So As I'm shooting my arrow I want him to scream &#34;EULALIA!&#34; (as i have told him to do). not AFTER I have shot it.Combat - 8/10Now being me, I am rather biased against Turn based combat systems, They are either boring, or just insanely brutal against you to the point of tears (Hello Persona...) however I'm going to pick that bias up and throw it out the window for this because it deserves my full unbiased viewing.The combat is great, it's fun and more complicated than simply pressing a single button untill things die. This game isn't a sit back and watch the program type of combat. You have to think. Admittedly part of winning is the setup before combat which I think is a good thing. Think a bit before you go into a fight and your fight should be much faster. bravely Default However, adds a twist. The Brave/Default system really spices things up in my opinion. The system is simple, yet complicated. In combat you have three choices, Attack, Brave, or Default. Attack meaning you take your turn, attack or use a skill/spell expending 1 BP (or more if a skill requires it) and that's about it. As long as you don't have negative BP you can act, you regenerate 1 BP a turn normally up to maximum of 3. Default allows you to defend, taking less damage and not acting this turn, in effect restoring 1 BP. Now these two options are fairly normal... then we get to the third option, and it's one I think makes the game stand out above others. The Brave Option.The Brave option allows you to act more than once when it's your turn. You can use it up to 3 times in 1 turn (Using 4 BP to do so). This allows you to use 4 attacks in 1 go, however it can leave you with a massive amount of Negative BP, which means you can't attack or defend until you don't have negative BP.The system may seem risky and it is, but it has purposes which Are brought forth by the job system. For instance one of the first skills you get as a monk is Invigorate, which increases your attack power by 25% for 2 turns (It has a chance to fail but lets for the sake of argument say it didn't!). Now in most instances you could only get 2 attacks off with that bonus attack, but if you use Brave to get 4 attacks in 1 turn off, you get to hit for 25% power 3 more times than usual. Of course after which you are usually exposed for a turn or 2, but who cares! Another good example is that say you just hit by a massive painful attack, 2 of your characters have died, and your white mage needs to get them up. Well use all 4 braves and you can cast raise twice, then cura twice. And if your like me your white mage was Defaulting for a few turns so he won't be left defenseless after a turn like that. It's just a lot of fun.Now, there are more risks than Just the obvious You can't act for a bit. The enemy can do this as well, they can use Brave and Default. More than once I've fought a boss that used Default the exact turn I decided to throw everything I had at him, and I ended up losing because He withstood my assault and destroyed my soul. It also makes the game a little less easy to predict, and adds a bit of fun to it. You never really know what the enemy is going to do! They are also limited by BP so don't expect them to attack 9 times or something. You can at all times see what the bosses BP is so you can guess on if you are about to be slammed by death or not.Now it's not perfect, and I didn't know where to take points off in this section or another but I chose this one. It being a JRPG does mean there is some grinding involved. And everyone who has played this type knows what I mean. You run around in circles on the map waiting for random encounters, you find a strategy that kills them in one turn and you keep doing that over and over and over again, Sometimes that Strat is a bit harder to find but once found it works endlessly. So I am not a big fan of that part, I can handle it, and it is still fun getting to that next job level. The game does progression amazingly well, you really do feel like you are gaining power with each level increase.The other point I take off is because of the fact that sometimes I feel like the AI is cheating. This may be me being paranoid, but rarely does the computer default until RIGHT after I decide to use everything I have at once, it's almost like clockwork. I think it waits and then acts after I've made a decision. It's annoying! but... alas it's probably my faut for trying to do everything in one turn. One other thing I will say is that the bosses are rough. Really rough. They require planning and have some incredibly cheap and devastating attacks.Network Features and Mini Things - 7/10Here we get into some of the slight issues I have with the game. This being the year 2013 (I know it's 2014 but the game was release originally in 2013!) We have decided that everything has to involve friends and friends lists and the internet and stuff. A theory that I sadly don't prescribe to. However, I can't fault it for trying either. There are just some key issues I think don't work that well and they inhibit the game somewhat. First I'll explain what it involves though.You can Summon friends to help you in combat, as well as be summoned by others. Now I don't mean a co-op or anything it's still a single player game. What I do mean is that if you have an internet connection you can register an attack or a heal and send it to your buddies to use as an attack in their game. For example I cast Rejuvenate on my entire Party and send it to the internet. Anyone on my friend's list can now summon my character and cast rejuvenate on their party (only once though). The more friends you have on your friends list the more options you can have to summon etc... Now there is an inherent issue with this. This being a Nintendo game, it's STILL annoying as hell to register people onto your friends list. You have to exchange codes and all that fun crap still, and without a forum or a central place where you are giving people codes you will not get them. You also have to have a wireless internet connection which yes at this point is fairly common but not everyone has it. The good thing is, Summoning and sending doesn't really add much to the game other than a bit of fun. The other feature however is more reliant on it.There is a mini-game in this game, and it's the restoration effort for Tiz's village. You can restore Shops, Get new specials, get special modifiers as well as weapons and armor you can't buy elsewhere in the game. This is a time consuming game that thankfully performs all it's tasks in the background or while your 3DS is in sleep mode. As I write this review, my villagers are at home building my shops up, and each one will take about 6 hours to do so. I left some major projects going while I went to work. Now you start the game with 1 villager, and he can build up things slowly. If you connect to the internet 1 time a day you slowly gain more and more villagers, this really helps in the restoration effort. But it also highlights the biggest problem I have. What if you don't have that option. If you can't connect to the internet, or you can't find anyone with spot pass... you are stuck with 1 villager and the amount of time it would take for him to do everything is months. And in that line, you would miss out on a lot of specials and cool items. It is easily remedied by going to a free Wi-Fi place which... heck I think even McDonald's has free wi-fi now, but still it's a tad off.Then there is the one thing I think wasn't needed in this game, it actually has a Micro transaction shop in it. What can you buy? Gear? Armor? Items? Noooo... you can buy Turns to use in combat. That's right.. you can Buy the ability to use an additional turn. I don't know the cost, because the first one is discounted at 50 cents and I didn't buy it. The other way to gain additional SP (That's the currency for extra turns) is to put the 3DS into sleep mode for 8 hours with the game running it's tasks. You can have up to 3 and can use them in combat whenever you want by pressing the start button. Honestly though. I don't really see the need for buying them. I can't say it's like the devil that it's in the game, but I have to question why it's there in the first place. It seems... just... odd to me.Which also brings up my final thought on the mini-game... you do have to keep your 3DS in sleep mode CONSTANTLY. Right now mine is plugged into the wall at home, and It's going to be on for a very very long time considering how much of the village I have to restore. I mean 5 villagers working on clearing one step of the village will take 20 hours. (99 alone!). But it is always a joy to come home or wake up after letting them work for 8 hours and getting all those rewards. No you can't pay to get them to work faster!You also have the ability to customize a few bits of difficulty in the game. Allowing you to change the frequency of encounters from 0 (none) to +100% (A lot more). This allows for better grinding, or getting back to town if you really didn't wanna fight things 20 levels lower than you! You can also enable or disable JP, EXP, Autosave, and change the difficulty from Normal to Hard or Easy. Hard mode... In my opinion is just frustrating and gives no reward for you actually playing in hard mode. At least none that I saw. It makes every fight brutal and basic enemies can one shot you, I didn't honestly enjoy it all that much, so I switched back to normal. And even then bosses destroy me. Seriously though I could not play this game without Autosave, I forget to save too often and would be annoyed with losing time!All in all, I give the game 9 Bitter Badgers out of 10. It's fantastic, and I can't seem to stop playing the damn thing. If you liked Final Fantasy Anything before XII, you will probably love this game. It has customization, craziness, and joy around every corner. The combat is fun yet challenging, the bosses may be a bit brutal, bit nothing a little grinding or better planning won't fix!TLDR Version: 9/10.Pros+Good risk vs. Reward combat+Decent Characters with lots of cliches thrown in+Nearly unparalleled amount of Customization for the type of game it is. From jobs to abilities to your special attacks.+Decent Story, doesn't hold the game up and has some fun dialog+Challenging if you want it to be.+Fairly easy if you want it to be, there is even an auto battle feature+It's final Fantasy V-2. No other way to put it!Cons-Voice acting is atrocious-Sometimes the AI can feel cheap-The internet features can be limiting if youo don't have the option to connect to them.-Did I mention the voice acting is BAD?-If you went digital it takes up basically an entire 4gb SD card.-Gotta leave your 3DS in sleep mode for the village to be rebuilt in any logical amoutn of time even with a good amount of villagers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2014"}

With that wealth of knowledge in hand, I'll say that this year's madden is very good.Can't say it's the best sports game or the best football game ever.  But it's a solid title.  The on the field play is the big improvement for me.  It's much faster, both in terms of action on the field and the time it takes to complete a game.  It feels like a simulation version of tecmo bowl in many ways.Things I love:The Rewind option is awesome.  Purists will probably cry foul, but I love being able to tinker with plays and figure out what I should have done when a play failed.The online dynasty is great in theory.  It's something EA needed to do a long time ago, and I look forward to this being part of every EA Sports game going forward.The add-on content available like accelorators for scouting are great, but I hate scouting...so take that with a grain of salt.  It's generally tedious and boring, but the accelorators let you speed through and make educated decisions on which players to pick.The menus, and general UI in the off-field activity are improved and allow you to more quickly get to where you need to go.Things I dislike:The create a superstare mode is boring.  It was nice the first few seasons as a change of pace, but needs a major overhaul.  I found myself wanting it to just be over as I was playing through my superstart games, and I've moved on to eclusively playing dynasty modes.All in all, it's one of those games that is a no-brainer for football fans that haven't played madden in a while.

Needless to say I was not dissapointed. Rather, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.Right off the bat, this game takes some getting used to. Not just the controls, but the way in which the game works. I myself am so used to running into a room and shooting everything in sight. This game simply does not allow this kind of gameplay. You must sneak around, do things quietly, and be sure not sound too many alarms or your mission is aborted and you lose. Some missions you can kill your enemies, other times you must simply knock them out. Either way, you are constantly concealing you actions by hiding bodies and keeping to the shadows.At first, I found this gameplay to be very frustrating. But after about 5 hours of playing, I started to get the \"hang\" of it. From that point on, I became addicted. There are so many replayability options, so many different ways to complete a mission, that the game never loses its fun. The gadgets and weapons that are available are also very cool and fun to use. You may need to look at a walkthrough now and then, but other than that the game is basically trial and error.I loved this game so much that I decided to buy the second game in the series, Pandora Tomorrow. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the dated graphics and the need for improvement in other areas.

The game that I look forward to whenever any new Nintendo system is released.My love affair started with me playing Super Mario Kart on my friend's Super Nintendo. Then when I got Mario Kart 64 for the N64, I could hardly put it down. It was probably my favorite multiplayer game on the N64 save for Super Smash Bros.Now after the decent but somewhat disappointing Double Dash on Gamecube, we arrive at Mario Kart Wii. My reaction is mixed.It is fun. But it is also starting to feel like the same old thing. Some of the new courses are fun, but just as many are forgettable. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but the most enjoyable courses for me were the remakes of classic Mario Kart courses. As enjoyable as they are, I'm leaning towards that being a bad thing, since it means that the new courses aren't up to par with Mario Kart's rich past.There are also two new items that are really cheap. The thunder cloud gives you a slight speed boost, but will zap you and shrink you if you don't pass it off to an opponent fast enough (think hot potato). Then there's the bullet bill, which will rocket the owner from near last place to the middle of the pack, at least. Like the infamous blue shell, this item punishes players who have been performing well and bumping up those bringing up the rear without demanding any skill from them. Yes, it does give inexperienced players a chance, but Mario Kart isn't that difficult to figure out, and it's just so frustrating to be doing well and then get hit with a thunder cloud or bullet billed.There is online play, now. This is where the game really shines. Mario Kart Wii is arguably the best online multiplayer experience on the Wii right now, and there doesn't appear to be anything really lined up to challenge it.So, it's a mixed bag, and you have to take the good with the bad (the good definitely outweighs the bad). If you want a fun racing game for the Wii, this is it. I just hope that any furture Mario Kart games can provide a fresher experience, and perhaps return a little more to the roots of the franchise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"AF \"Whigs\"","summary":"Fun, but requires some work to get there","reviewText":"I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday.  I'd wanted to get him Marvel vs. Capsom 2 for PS2, but that game is just too expensive due to demand.  This seemed like something in the same vein, and I was right.  Previously my son had played a couple of the Soul Caliber games, and some old Street Fighter II games on an arcade compilation we have for Ps2.First, the graphics for this game are excellent.  We have our Wii hooked to our LCD flatscreen with component cables and it looks fantastic.  The animation is smooth and I haven't noticed any slowdown.The gameplay is a modern fighting game, meaning you button mash to a certain degree, but at some point you have to just dive in and embrace the complexity of the fighting system.  Characters have plenty of moves to learn and what my son loves (and I do too) are the special moves that fill the screen with all sorts of mayhem.  This one of those games where it takes awhile to become accustomed to the hectic onscreen action.Ultimately it's all about timing and understanding how to counter your opponent's attacks.  This can be extremely frustrating until you get it right.  I'm no expert, certainly, but I'm OK for a semi-old guy.  Fighting games take a lot of work - A LOT - to really get good.  Keep that in mind, and know that if you plan to play with your kids you really need to try to keep up.  But it's fun.We use the Wiimote & nunchuck combo, which is fine.  I haven't tried our classic controller yet because I haven't felt the need to.  We'll see.Overall this game is pretty spectacular.  It's cartoon violence, there's no blood, and it's all so over-the-top that I don't have any qualms about my 10 year old playing it.  I think Capcom does a good job in that regard with their fighting games - they're about learning a deep, varied fighting system, not about cheap thrills.  Well - the cheap thrills are huge explosions and crazy special attacks, not blood.And for parents who are new to fighting games, don't be afraid to try to learn this game with your kid(s).  It's actually very rewarding to make progress in a game that is complex and hectic and at first seems so intimidating.  We love it, and it's one of our favorite wii games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"A reboot of a classic franchise","reviewText":"When I first got a Playstation 2 many years ago I was looking for pre-owned games to buy at my local shop. Looking over the titles I saw a game that had a red cover and an imposing figure on the box. The game was Devil May Cry and I thought this would be an excellent game to play in my collection. So I plunked down the $15 and rushed home with my purchase and couldn't wait to start playing it. As I started playing I got to the first boss and I simply could not get past it no matter how hard I tried.I took the game and put it away and never played it again.As the other sequels in the series were released the gameplay was ramped up significantly making it a challenge for even the veteran gamer. Now Capcom looks to be revitalizing the brand with their newest entry into the series simply titled DMC.First the game has no ties to the first three games so think of this newest entry of the game as a reboot to the series. As you play Dante living in the accursed Limbo City you are gifted with being able to battle the demons that plague this city. The reason for this is that you are a nephilim which means you are part angel and part demon.  You are contacted by your brother Vergil who leads a secret organization known as the Order and wants you to join him to rid the city of these demons forever.The gameplay is not all about combat rather it is combat mixed with platforming as you will have to navigate thru the twisted levels that the game throws at you. But you will go into this fight with a nice arsenal as you have two demonic weapons (an axe and battle gauntlets) as well as two angelic weapons (a scythe and throwing stars). Add to this your sword, guns, a shotgun and a gun that allows you to shoot explosives that can be set off on remote control and you have a badass arsenal. DMC allows you to switch between weapons on the fly so you'll be able to dish out more damage and increase your style rank which gives you more orbs to use to upgrade Dante.With twenty levels along with hidden challenge rooms (which you will need keys to unlock), collectibles and even more content planned for this game it is clear to see that DMC is going to give gamers a run for their money. And the best part about this game? You can actually pick up and PLAY it without worrying about a steep learning curve!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

An added cover system, and new bullet time features make playing max payne way less frustrating and more fun that the first two. Although health doesn't regenerate constantly searching for pills makes you feel like the drug dependent lunatic Max is. The story is just as dark and twisted as ever and is a good length campaign. The lack of walking, and falling of narrow beams is also an improvement. Traversing the levels is more fluid and checkpoints are in the right places.The multiplayer is not a super deep experience but really fun and simple.

Jackie must learn to fully command the Darkness so he can take back control of the Franchetti family, which is ruled by his uncle Paulie, a despicable man who is almost universally despised.","reviewerName":"MurphysLaw","summary":"Decent Game with a few flaws","reviewText":"The Darkness has a creative concept though sadly the developers didn't capitalize on it as well as they could have. The story is based on the graphic novel series (though I'm not familiar with them) and it's unique in that you're a mob guy that is suddenly possessed by demonic powers but it can also be incredibly predictable at times.  You meet certain characters and can immediately guess their fate.  The graphics are decent, most notably the backgrounds but often characters speak without their mouths moving, including the main character.  Mob ventriloquists, I guess.  The voice acting is also okay for the most part though unless they are pivotal to the plot, many characters just repeat generic comments.  There are also a few really goofy comments made periodically and often the main character is a bit over the top though again, maybe that is true to the comics.  There is also a good bit of backtracking as you progress through the game, which tends to get old.The Darkness powers are the saving grace of the game, though some are far more useful than others.  I wish the developers had explored the powers a bit more because using them is really what makes the game fun.  The voice work for the Darkness and summoned creatures are quite good and the comments can be quite amusing.  I'm not sure why there are so many complaints about the controls, they seemed very basic and easy to pick up.  If your biggest issue is the fact that you use the L2/R2 buttons instead of L1/R1 to fire your guns, get over it and move your fingers a fraction of an inch.  Also, for those complaining about having to knock out the lights...the game is called The DARKNESS?  What were you expecting?  You even get a power and a darkling that does the work for you.  I mean, really.The game managed to hold my interest throughout and while it certainly has it's fair share of flaws, I still found it to be fun.  You can easily find this game in the bargain bins and for what you'll pay for it, it's worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}

Unlike the other play sets, the Cars play set focuses primarily on driving ('cause, you know... they're cars). The experience is very fun and currently one of my favorite play sets.The package comes with the Cars play set and two figures, Lightning McQueen (the main character of the series) and Holley Shiftwell (an agent who appeared in Cars 2). The figures themselves are very nice and features sticker-like decorations rather than paint. The only thing I don't like about them is that, in gameplay, they play exactly the same.Gameplay, as stated earlier, is different from the other play sets. Instead of fighting enemies and solving puzzles, you drive around Radiator Springs and do things such as race and tow other cars. This unusually simple concept is done very well, mostly due to the extra things you can do in the play set. I especially love collecting toy box pieces and destroying things in the town. This play set, while short, is to me significantly more fun than the Cars 2 game (also developed by Avalanche).Overall, this is one of my favorite play sets. Though I would have appreciated it if they made the cars play differently, the gameplay maintains the greatness of the other play sets without being unoriginal. I would highly recommend this to anyone who plays Disney Infinity.Final Score: 8.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2014"}

VASQUEZ","summary":"This game is nowhere near it's hype, instead what you'll find is a bit of an above average shooter","reviewText":"I've been waiting for this game for a long time, ever since i saw the E3 trailers on it a good long back. A game that was full of promise, the killer app that the PS3 needed in order to get itself rolling for this generation.After multiple delays, the long wait is over, and the result could not be more underwhelming. My my Sony, what have you done?Do not be misled by magazine reviews, this isn't by far a bad game, but it surely isn't nowhere near the messiah status that some online magazines would have you believe, this game has serious shortcomings that hold it back from greatness. Let's go into some of them here:*CONTROLS: One of the biggest disappointments of the game, they feel heavy and slow, moving an aiming is needless hassle, you will find yourself dying over and over again, not because of great AI, but because the controls react so slowly to user actions, that you'll be dead before you even get a chance to fire the first shot. This in itself is inexcusable, why couldn't sony implement the usual type of fast shooter controls? much like COD controls, etc?, surely this couldn't be a difficult task, the speed and reaction time for shooters is pretty much common ground by these days, but sony decided to reinvent the wheel it seems, and in turn they damaged what could have been an excellent game.*GRAPHICS: Yes, this game has beautiful graphics overall, but if you look closely in different situations and areas, you'll see inconsistencies with textures that don't match the overall level of quality the game tries to establish. For example, the weapon textures get blurry sometimes depending on how you are positioned. There's also areas of the game that don't look as polished as others. The gray colors that in the first two levels are nice to look at, get saturating as you move through the levels, since the entire game uses more or less the same palette of colors. And all though you're supposedly navigating through a city, every single level design feels as if you're in the middle of a factory, same look and feel as you progress through. By the time you reach the middle of the game, you've pretty much seen everything.The game also suffers from sporadic clipping problems, they are not frequent, but when they do happen they can be quite annoying.*ENEMY AND ALLY AI: Enemy AI is generally very good, they cover, they move if you try to corner them or throw grenades at them, all in all it's generally impressive. There are times though, when enemies just stand in a corner and wait for you to shoot them down, not giving much reaction, this though, does not happen too often.Ally AI is also pretty much the same, but seems to be inconsistent in specific areas of the game, more notably in the final stages. You could find yourself dealing with 9 out of 10 enemies in a room, and your buddy can't even manage to handle the remaining enemy, so you might see recurring situations where you're going against 7 soldiers while your buddy is behind you, but one soldier will catch you from behind and murder you, while your buddy just watches.Again this seems to happen more often in the final stages, and it can be extremely frustrating, because you get the feeling as if you're alone in the area, even though the dude is right there next to you.Also, your buddies have this constant habit of blocking your path, specially in narrow areas, you'll find yourself trying to jump over them in impatience.*WEAPONS: There are a good number of weapons in the game, but most of them unoriginal, and you won't care for 80% of them, most of the time you'll find yourself using another weapon, not because you like it, but because the game forces you to use it due to lack of bullets from your weapon of choice, which will usually be the assault rifle you start the game with. You'll find yourself using that same weapon in the final stage as well.In conclusion this is by no means a bad game, but the fact that it falls so far below it's hype, really takes a lot from it. And this is really a shame, as sony had more than ample time to make this game as good as it could be, and instead they fail in aspects that should be long since routine.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2009"}

Using the latest Unreal technology,Unreal Tournament 2003takes you to the merciless arenas of the future, where elite warriors rely on skill, speed, cunning, and awesome firepower to demonstrate their style and become the ultimate champion.","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Unreal Tournament Preview","reviewText":"The game itself is very similar to the original Unreal Tournament in gameplay, meaning it'll still have single-player, deathmatch, and team-based levels.  Many of the current weapons from the original game will also be included here.  However, the graphics of the environments, characters, and even the weapons have been remarkably improved.The environments in particular have taken a major facelift.  Indoor arenas still look cramped and mechanical as if you're in the middle of some robotic manufacturing plant.  The pipes on the walls jut out prominently and grills and steam vents are everywhere.  All in all much more detailed and realistic looking.  The outdoor environments are particularly nice with a combination of grassy and rocky hillsides, detailed trees and waterfalls.  Even running into dense brush will make blades of tall grass obscure your view.  It was interesting to see this combination of nature and machinery as players access mechanical elevator platforms at the base of a hillside.  In another level, players could blast away at each other inside and outside a snow-covered city in the middle of a blizzard.  Another level took place high up among a large forest, something you might see in Lord of the Rings or Everquest.A demo of the terrain editor showed how users can easily build terrain.  Think of an outdoor environment being a multiple of layers.  The first is solid rock, the second is the rocky surface that adds texture, and the third layer is the grassy surface.  Users can easily select a layer and simply paint the environment as they see fit.The creators have focused strongly on balancing the weapons based on feedback from the user community (of course they always say that, right?)  For instance, it'll be much more difficult to camp in a corner and snipe away as the gun now shoots a bolt of electricity, making it much easier to tell where the camper's at.  The rocket launcher seems relatively unchanged, however shooting three rockets at one time leaves some really nice trails.  The ripper disappears this time around (did anyone ever use this anyway?) and is replaced with a new gun that can power up a shield in front of the player that'll absorb damage for a brief period of time.  The way around this is to shoot something behind the player.  Instead of the flak gun spraying shrapnel, it now shoots a canister that explodes in flak (might help to get that guy with the shield on).  Another gun (the goop gun perhaps?) seemed to give off its own light which served to illuminate dark areas and was a nice lighting effect.  The drawback, of course, is it could probably give away your position too.  The minigun returns (with exploding bullets), and the shock rifle also sends out an exploding ball of energy which could prove devastating in cramped quarters, but the slow movement will probably render it ineffective in a large outdoor environment.  The Redeemer is scheduled to return, but it was still in development.  Finally, the pulse rifle shoots really nice looking streams of blue electricity at the player that's surprisingly reminiscent of the weapons in the movie Ghostbusters.  Word has it teams can also combine their energy streams for even greater impact.  Hmmm... wonder where they got that idea from?Mods and mutators will be included in this version which, unfortunately, leaves the door open for invincibility cheats and other hacks, but the developers felt the door needed to be left open for us to create our own improvements.  All in all, the gameplay remains much the same (good!) but it'll be an all new look and feel and I'm sure current UT fans will love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2002"}

All THAT for THAT?!?!\"Yeah, it's a lot of wires. It's a good thing when talking in terms of comfortable sitting distance from your console/ computer/ etc. to wherever you're situated but it's admittedly somewhat overwhelming. The headphones themselves sound wonderful, however and the included audio control unit helps to get the sound quality right where you want it with a dizzying variety of settings and functions. Connectivity is simple but depending on what you're using it with. The PS3 for instance requires a couple of setting changes on the system dashboard while a PC is pretty much plug and play. The headphones are very comfortable and very sturdy. You can feel the build quality simply by holding them. Mic chat is crystal clear with various adjustments that you can make with the control unit.I guess my only real gripe with these headphones are the insane amount of wiring that it seems you have to wrangle with when you're using them. I'm using theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP510 Premium Wireless Dolby Digital Gaming Headsetwith my Xbox 360 and I'm telling you, it's such a relief when using a headset that doesn't come inundated with the amount of wires that this one does and still does all the same things. Using this with an Xbox 360 requires ANOTHER wire just for chatting. If I had to recommend between the two, I'd say go for the XP510's but that's not to say that the XP SEVENs are a bad headset because they're really not. They sound really, really good and it's abundantly clear to me why these would be selected as the official headset of MLG gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"theshonen8899","summary":"Half one game plus half another game equals...half a game...?","reviewText":"I've been playing army shooters since Battlefield 1942 and Call of Duty 1. I've always been convinced that the Battlefield franchise were masters of immersive war-like multi-player while the Call of DUty franchise has been experts of intense, cinematic singe-player campaigns (where this sudden flux of popularity for a scrapped together crap multi-player variant came from, I do not know). Here is Medal of Honor, an attempt to combine both. Yet on both single-player and multi-player fronts, it compromises and leave you feeling with half a game on both side.The single-player is generally not memorable. They did a really good job implementing some nice features and bringing back old one that should never have been taken out. Slide to cover is a great innovative control and lean/prone should be in every shooter. Some moments were pretty cinematic (you'll pass over a hill and witness a looming AC-130 taking fire from the moutainside) but they are rare and mostly surrounded by repetitive and uninspired gameplay. Sometimes you really have to look at the game and wonder if the developers really gave a crap when they were making it and stuffing it full of shooter cliches. The ending was also unoriginal and left you feeling disappointed at its short length, a con that worked with CoD 4 because of it's variety of gameplay but not in a game as lackluster as MoH.The multi-player is definitely the better part of the game, but not really by much. There are only five team assault, sector control, and objective raid maps and only three combat mission maps. They're planning on releasing two more maps, but from the same problems seem to be apparent. All the maps look the same. Saying it's all in Afgahnistan is no excuse. There could have been a cool night-time map, a rain map, or a map with a river. Instead, all the maps are shabby buildings and desert. The two new maps seem to be a breathe of fresh air though, and the combat mission maps are pretty nice, which leads to my next point. It seems like most of the fun is to be had in combat mission. If you are a fan of rush in Bad Company 2 like I am, you'll love combat mission also, which is pretty much the same thing except instead of arming two objectives you arm one or secure one point. The radio chatter for the US team is exciting and you feel like you're playing a single-player campaign when you're on the US team. It's always a dread to play as Taliban on combat mission for me though, as there is no cool radio chatter and it seems you're role is to act like a bot and defend the objective from the human campaign players.Overall, if you haven't played CoD 4 or MW2, then don't buy this for the single-player and get either of those. If you haven't played Battlefield 2 or Battlefield: Bad Company 2, don't buy this for the multi-player and get those. If you've played them all and you're looking for something new like me, wait for the price to go down to around $20-30 to get this, because I totally regret playing the full retail price for this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"Douglas Welzel","summary":"Fantastic FPS","reviewText":"I was hooked on this game shortly after the multiplayer demo came out and have been playing it ever since.The single player game drops you right in the middle of WWII and allows you to experience some of the most well known battles of the war.  Each campaign demands different techniques.  In some you are storming through bunkers machine gunning everything in sight, while another puts you in the middle of a dreary sniper-ridden village where paranoia reigns supreme.  Along the way you'll work with and be assisted by other troops who are more than willing to put themselves in harms way for you.  My only complaint is that the single player game is a bit too short.  There were more missions than I was expecting, but I wanted more.The multiplayer game is a different beast all together.  There is a different set of maps for multiplayer.  The games range from free-for-all (deathmatch) to objective based team matches.  The multiplayer game is as least as much fun as the single player.  The biggest downside here is the use of Gamespy.  The game has an internal browser for finding network games, but you'll probably find yourself using Gamespy since the internal browse is quite poor.  With Gamespy you'll be subjected to watching ads (unless you decide to register it) just to find a game to play.Finally, I just have to say the initial release of this game was terribly buggy.  After playing the demo for months with no problems I installed the release version to have it continuously crash on me early in the game.  I was stuck with a non-working game until the patch was finally released.  I had similar experiences with F1 2001 and Black &amp; White.  EA's initial releases are clearly beta (at best) and should be treated as such (ie: don't expect much until the first patch is out).  Luckily the patch for MOH is out now and most of the problems appear to be resolved.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2002"}

Once i beat all the bosses though the game got stale because at the time there was no patch to make them respawn so there was really nothing to do but shoot random people.  Recently i plugged it in for a quick refresh on the game and saw that they had a patch to allow respawn of bosses.  Well the fun is back again.  This added a lot more gameplay to the game.  I am in teh process of replaying the game.  I would recommend this game to buy for anything 20 or less.  Remember it is a crime fighting game but it does have some rpg elements.  You collect orbs to level up your skills which you get for killing characters a certain way or from exploring and finding xp drops.  You shoot a guy you get xp in gun skills.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Morally... different, technically brilliant, a lot of fun to play","reviewText":"To someone like me who did not play the prequels, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a solid 5-star game. The goal is for you to save Rome (Roma) from the Borgia forces with a lot of help from historical characters such as Machiavelli and under full control from `the future' - that would be the present-day you helping the `you in the past' re-enact the past... it's complicated but it's fun playing it. In order to do this you have an arsenal of weaponry that can range from a small blade to a tank that can clear out dozens of enemies. And, if you really want to know what's going on or rather what went on, there is a massive in-game database that holds a lot of information about the buildings and the places you see and the historical characters you interact with. But... yes, the plot.You must find the location of the apple of Eden in modern time (present) and, of course, save the world but, in order to find this information you need to live the life of Ezio of the 13th century. There is this machine called the Animus which allows you to access the memories of your ancestors. If you are able to survive through part of his Ezio's life you will find the path to the item that was able to save Rome and will help you save the present day world. Of course, LOTS must die if the world is to be saved and, as a professional assassin, it's going to be you or your allies responsible for all that creative killing. But the cause just - saving the world and getting rid of those bad Borgia guys - and Machiavelli makes it clear that achieving a good goal justifies any means. Well... you better believe that if you want to feel good about whatever it is that you are doing in the game :)You are assigned very specific missions but while playing you can do whatever you choose to in-between missions. While playing, you can choose to engage multiple enemies at once that can give you the feeling of split second action scenarios - a rush that not many games can compete with and, remember, it's all done for a good cause. Not only is the fighting well made, the climbing also has a very nice feel to it. In the beginning of the game climbing may cause little thought at all, but as you progress you are forced to keep your mind open and look for those hand and foot holds that are keeping you from falling to your death. Creativity is a key part of the game and it will stretch to its limits if you are to play the game well.Sometimes when you get bored of playing on the campaign you can play with your friends on multiplayer and compete in a variety of game modes that usually involve you assassinating other people or you avoiding it.  Some of the multiplayer game modes are cooperative and slow, while others are a free for all and can lead to fierce competition and last-second wins. If you really want to test your reaction time, and mental skills, multiplayer is the place to do it.`Brotherhood' comes with a remarkably good if not morally compelling story line and I appreciated the huge amount of historical information that can be accessed at any time in the story mode and helps placing everything within its historical context. And those who don't necessarily agree with the Machiavellic views on morality (I don't) may still enjoy a very-well made game when it comes with combat and tactics and graphically stunning even for a PS3. While not a particularly long game in the story mode, you should be able to spend many more exciting, fun-filled extra hours in the multiplayer universe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"546598","summary":"com bat","reviewText":"Since Army of TWO series has been out, I really wasn't impressed with those games. The characters seemed bulky and the gameplay just didn't impress me. Not to mention, the graphics were horrible. However, after seeing numerous videos on Devil's Cartel, I decided to finally give the franchise a try.A.I. (Bravo): The A.I. of Bravo is one of the best I've seen in a team-based shooter. Bravo is not just a prop, who shoots, aimlessly and gets in the way. He is VERY involved and reliable. He gets cover, when needed. In certain situations, he will not fire, until it is initiated by the player. Not to mention, he does not get in the way of the player, while in a gunfight. The most impressive action is he may wait, until the right time, then move ahead and kill enemies at random. However, his actions are carried out in a tactical way.CAMPAIGN/STORY: This game introduces TWO new characters called Alpha and Bravo (players will be Alpha). They are sent to Mexico to go up against La Guadana, who is a deadly drug cartel.CUSTOMIZATION: Weapons can be greatly customized on this game. In fact, it is similar to that of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. With that being said, every part of a weapon can be customized and also tested out at the range. Masks can be customized, as well. Players can use default designs or even create their own.GAMEPLAY: The newest addition to the game is the infamous Frostbite 2 engine, which is used in BF3. Of course, the previous TWO games used the Unreal engine. The destructible environments, along with the animations and physics, complement each other very well. Enemies, as well as nearby structures are sent flying, when blasted by grenades. Also, enemies react differently, based upon how and where they are shot. For example, I shot an enemy in the leg, and he was limping. Bravo once shot an enemy and as he was falling to the ground, I shot him in the head and his hat flew off. Heads can be severed by powerful weapons. I once saw an enemy slammed up against a wall, when hit gunfire from a gatling gun.Then, there has been an improvement in theTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2-like points system for various types of kills. For example, a player can get points for scoring a headshot, flanking an enemy, killing with a grenade, surprise kills, decoy kills, multiple kills, melee kills, combination kills, etc. Points can be used to upgrade weapons and accessories.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters.

Needless to say, I'm a huge fan.  When this game got announced for the DS, I was extremely excited.  I pre-ordered it, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  Well, I got it, played it some, and then I let it sit.  Over the past several months, I've picked it up here and there.  I'll play it in fits-and-starts.  Ultimately, I can't bring myself to really play it.  Sure, the graphics are very polished and nice, and I love the music (just like any other title from the series!)  There are also some bright spots scattered here and there too.  The game, however, feels like that the people behind this game wanted to make a game that would last a long time.  Well, they succeeded with quantity over quality.  The most important feature of any RPG is story, and with DQ9, we're being told a story that's only OK. I can deal with a story that's only OK, if the game has engaging game-play.  But we don't even have that here!  What we did get was an annoying level-up/jobs system, a mess of tedious side quests and forced grinding.  Let me fill in some details here:Level Up System --  It takes a lot of XP to level up as you move through the game if you stick with one class.  Sure, you can switch classes and knock out a few easy levels and get some skill points, but the best skills come at higher levels.  Trying to make an uber-character can take too much time and research.  When playing a Dragon Quest game, I kind of just want to move through the story.Side Quests --  You'll run across some NPC's with blue-colored conversation balloons over their heads.  These folk have side quests that you can complete.  Unfortunately, many of them are of the form \"go kill X number of enemy Y using tactic Z.\"  These tactics used seem to be the most annoying way to fight (go kill them with an under-powered skill, or weak weapon, for example.)  Some of these side quests are required if you'd like to train a character in a particular job, which is unfortunate.  Others have rewards that don't mean nearly as much to the game, and are there for our amusement (or in my case, annoyance.)Characters --  You recruit a party of generic members in this game, very much like you did in DQ3.  It was fine back then, as personality had no role what-so-ever in the first few Dragon Quest titles.  But once they hit DQ4, characters with at least a smidgen of personality were introduced.  Here, we get customized sprites.  They simply follow you around and follow orders.This game did have some interesting ideas behind it.  The combo-system is neat when you can get it to work.  I also like how the characters appearance change when you equip different things (even if the new look was sometimes awful!)  Running around and NOT having random encounters is a huge plus for me.  In fact, random encounters can ruin my taste for a game sometimes.  With DQ9, you almost always know when a fight will take place!So is this game terrible?  No.  I've certainly played worse.  But I do think it might be the worst of the series!  I expect some level of grinding with any Dragon Quest (or RPG) title.  It's kind of the nature of the beast here.  We're kind of forced into a grind here, though, and it really detracts from the game.  Especially when the story is rather weak!  (The story actually had an interesting start, but became a lather-rinse-repeat throughout.)  I'm sure fans of the series will appreciate the game on some level.  In the end, I found some appreciation for the parts that I played.  But it's not on my \"I need to finish this\" list.  I may get around to it, but not any time soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Brilliance","reviewText":"Chell, a test subject at Aperture Science, has successfully destroyed the insane AI known as GLaDOS and escaped from the facility. Unfortunately, injured in the final battle, she was 'rescued' by a robot from the facility and returned to cold storage. Awakening many years later, Chell finds herself once against trapped in the facility. With the help of a friendly AI, Wheatley, she must flee once more...something made harder when GLaDOS is brought back online.Released in 2007 as an add-on to the 'Orange Box' compilation, Portal was a surprise success for its developers, Valve. It won several Game of the Year awards and glowing plaudits for its conciseness and the cleverness of its central mechanic, not to mention the frequently hilarious writing (and the brilliant closing song). Portal 2 has a lot to live up to and is put in a difficult situation for a sequel. Sequels are usually bigger, more epic and larger in scale than the original, but the Portal concept wouldn't really work on a vaster canvas. Making a sequel to Portal that respected the original game without ruining the things that made it brilliant would therefore appear to be a tall order.Happily, Valve have pulled it off. From start to finish Portal 2 is almost unimpeded brilliance. The game is longer than Portal, coming in at about eight hours compared to the original's three. Since even the splendid original game was risking becoming stale at the end, Valve have split the sequel into three clear sections. In the first Chell uses portals very much as in the first game and is aided by Wheatley and opposed by GLaDOS. At the end of this sequence Chell finds herself in the most ancient parts of the facility, where a very different set of puzzles await using different mechanics. In this section she has no enemies or opponents but is guided through the puzzles via messages pre-recorded by Aperture Science's long-deceased founder, Cave Johnson. After this she returns to the upper levels where an all-new set of challenges await, leading to the epic conclusion.As such Valve neatly avoid what could have been the game's biggest pitfall, outliving its welcome. The shifts in tone, plot and game mechanics are handled well, but still combine to form a coherent game. The cast has been enlarged with the addition of Stephen Merchant (Ricky Gervais's wingman, who increasingly is outshining his partner) as Wheatley. Valve wanted a completely different type of vocal performance for Wheatley then you normally get in a video game and Merchant's half-ad-libbed dialogue is different and more immediate, not to mention hilarious. J.K. Simmons (best-known as J. Jonah Jameson in the Raimi Spider-Man movies) provides the recorded voice of Cave Johnson and his deadpan delivery of increasingly deranged dialogue is also excellent. Ellen McLain also returns as GLaDOS and, in one of the more inspired ideas in the game, is given more dramatic meat to work with as GLaDOS begins to suffer an immense internal struggle as she and Chell discover the secret past of Aperture Science.Graphically, the game looks great with some impressive production design and animations. The Source Engine (eight years old in 2012) is definitely ageing, but nevertheless remains impressive. The puzzles are fairly fiendish and require some lateral thinking in order to make sense of all the new elements ('paints' that give different effects to surfaces, catapults that throw the player around, tractor beams and light-bridges), but the gradual introduction of these elements allows the player to get to grips with them effectively. There's a few puzzles near the end of the game that are really tough, but nothing too frustrating. More complex are the puzzles in co-op mode, but with two players working on solutions these shouldn't be too much of a problem.Events in the game build and culminate in the final battle, which is once again impressive. However, the finale of the game must rank amongst the most bizarre - but also brilliant - in gaming history. From the unexpected opera serenade to Wheatley's closing, introspective monologue it's thoroughly entertaining. Things are left open for the continuation of Chell's story (either in further Portal games or possibly future Half-Life titles) but there is no cliffhanger.Portal 2 (*****) is funny, clever, dramatic, well-acted and constantly inventive, and one of the best games in Valve's already stellar history. It is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3) and the USA (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2012"}

While it is mildly entertaining, there are still quite a few bugs to iron out. I think Respawn made a mistake by not offering a single player campaign, I usually will not give a game a second thought if it does not offer the Single Player Campaign, however because I had friends getting this I decided to bite the bullet and try it.Now, aside from the lack of single player mode; there is absolutely not $60 worth of content here. If they want an online only game then there should be many more maps and match types and introducing mods to change the flow of things would be great! There simply isn't enough variety, this game gets very redundant very quick I was bored within a few hours of game play. Players also have no ability to choose a preferred faction, there is also no option to choose a map (or let players vote on the next map to be played, it is all random, you choose your match type and you are randomly thrown in, replaying the Campaign is the same thing.Someone had compared this to an MMO is defense of its online only restriction and well, just about every successful MMO offers a wide array of single player missions and PvP is optional. If they wanted online only that is fine but offer a co-op campaign for the players.For FPS games, any good game should have and focus on the Single Player Campaign, the online play is just a perk; another way to play the game, it is a nice bonus for the price paid for a full game. FPS do not really make good online only games. It absolutely feels like I paid full price for a third of a game!This game had huge potential, they really could have made something with Titanfall! I feel like the developers really let the players down with this one, I don't know if they just didn't feel like making it a complete game or didn't know how to tie it into a story mode but it absolutely feels like a half-butt effort.So, if an online only FPS is what your looking for then this game may be great for you but I would advise you wait for the price to drop, new content to be added (though they will charge you again for any new content) and work out some of the \"new game\" bugs. Stick with CoD and Battlefield in the mean time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

I say to the people who first bashed the DS, this is what you get for talking crap.  It might be astonishing that Sony is getting their butts kicked, after all, PS2 destroyed the Gamecube in terms of sales (same thing with PS and N64), but some people just don't get the PSP.

YOu know you do not want to be bored with the tedious details and how everythng is better and all the other stuff you basically don't need, but this system is ideal even for the people who have original DS's.

Once players get past the needlessly lengthy (and unskippable) 2 minutes of opening cinematics, they're 'treated' to some of the worst gameplay, realism and overall fun on the otherwise fantastic Playstation console. Each level is filled with unnecessarily difficult quirks, ranging from invincible opponents to hidden obstacles. A picket fence now has to power to halt a speeding automobile dead in its tracks, as does a small dumpster. One level asks you to 'highjack a truck', getting to mention that this 12 ton hauler can out-accellerate and handle your 2-ton sports car. Adding to the &quot;fun factor&quot; is the unwavering, needlessly impervious opponent that starts directly behind you, pushing you out of control almost instantly. As a sort of cherry on top, you're given a time limit. What fun. I enjoyed the original Driver, and found myself hoping for something similar here. Alas; no such luck.

The gameplay is addictive and fun, the controls are easy to master, and the storyline is pretty unique. I'll avoid spoilers as to the why, who and what of \"BioShock\" as with most detailed games of this nature, watching the storyline unfold is half the fun. Rest assured that if you enjoy \"survival horror\" games like the ones I mentioned above, you'll like this game.The gameplay is similar to that of the first couple \"Resident Evil\" games, as a player dropped into a wierd and hostile environment you have to solve puzzles, defend yourself against some nasty bad guys (and girls), pick up weapons, find diaries and clues, and best of all...explore your environment.The world of \"BioShock\" is just pure eye candy...a city deep under the ocean. The graphics are beautiful...in a seriously creepy kind of way. One of the best things about owning a PS3 is the \"pop\" video game graphics now have...and \"BioShock\" maximizes that \"pop\", brining the underwater city to life. The soundtrack is simply amazing. Tunes from the 1930's and 1940's by The Inkspots and other vocal groups of that time add such a haunting tone to the game.

By far the two biggest complaints I heard were the broken gameplay mechanics and the overpopulation of people. I figured the tide of people would have subsided by the time I joined up, and I didn't personally notice any of said gameplay mechanics in the beta, so when I saw ESO drop to half price here on Amazon, I jumped on it.This game is beautifully breathtaking. My first impressions were that this is graphically just like Skyrim, which is one of my favorite games of all time. If you don't like Skyrim's graphic style, you won't like this. It's pretty much identical. I was drawn in immediately by the ambiance and expertly crafted environments. The attention to detail in this game is far greater than any other MMO I've personally played. It feels like a real, living, breathing world. The world is also enormous. If you love exploration, you will love this. Special little rewards can be found by those that seek them out and explore every nook and cranny of an area. Also, just as with Skyrim, you can rummage through any container, sometimes finding junk, but sometimes also finding crafting materials and equipment to better your character.Regarding the issues with gameplay I read about, I've experienced none of them. Granted there's been quite a few patches since release and we're about 3 months past launch now, so I suspect if there were any such issues, they've all been ironed out because I found nothing wrong. I was concerned about the combat, because while it's very similar to traditional Elder Scrolls combat (identical to Skyrim, really) it's very different from any other MMO I've played. I heard from a friend who played the beta extensively that the combat is what ruined the game for him. I suppose it's really a personal preference, because I love the combat system.It's very different from standard MMO combat, but that also makes it very refreshing, and not in a &#34;Oooh shiny!&#34; way that gets old after a few days or weeks, but in a long lasting way that really makes the entire game more enjoyable for me. You actively have to swing your sword or fire your bow or activate your staff, while also actively blocking and dodging any incoming attacks. In addition to this, you have your standard hot key bar but with a twist. You're able to &#34;slot&#34; 6 abilities at any given time. It's very reminiscent of Guild Wars, but in a less restrictive way. You are free to pick and choose whatever 6 abilities you want at any time and you can level up many more to change up your playstyle. Say you want to be a magic DPS when you're solo, but swap to a healing role when you're partied up. Very simple to do by leveling the right abilities and swapping them at will.This skill system is where the game really shines, beyond all the flashy graphics and engaging combat. This system is, in my opinion, best compared to that of Rift. You get a skill tree for your chosen class (dragonknight, templar, sorceror, nightblade or templar) which consists of 3 &#34;branches&#34; off that tree. Each of those 3 branches contains numerous skills that you can put points into when you level up, thereby unlocking that skill and allowing you to level it up by using it, much like Skyrim. Some skills are active, some are passive. Then you have another skill tree for your weapon, armor, race, guild, world and craft, each with it's own set of branches and subsequent skills. You're free to pick and choose absolutely any combination that you could dream of. There are no limits.By carefully selecting your skills, you can craft your character to be exactly how you envision it. With MMO's becoming more and more mainstream, leveling up in said games has also become less interesting as you're heavily guided down a singular path in many of them. The skill system in ESO is like a breath of fresh air, coming from many many years of playing World of Warcraft and having my talents now spoon fed to me to ensure I don't make any mistakes. If you do make mistakes, you can also reset your skill points and start all over until you get your build just how you want it. It's a system that rewards critical thinking and planning, and it doesn't just look good on paper, it performs beautifully.There really are no downsides to ESO in my experience. Given that it's an MMO, you WILL run into other people, all the time, in fact. People are everywhere, which is what I was really looking forward to in ESO. In all my hundreds of hours playing Skyrim, I often thought to myself, this would be so much more fun if I could play with my friends. That's what ESO is, Skyrim with friends, new and old alike. The storytelling and immersion is just as superb as it was in Skyrim and it's predecessors. But as with any community, be it online or out your front door, there are bad apples in every bunch. There are jerks, there are spawn campers, there are immature people shouting in town. You will find that with ANY MMO, I promise. So far in ESO, the exposure to such things has been barely noticeable and by comparison, far better than WoW in general. I noticed ONE person camping a boss in one cave, but I got my kill in (which wasn't even required for the quest I was on) and went on my merry way. I saw nothing of these mobs of people hoarding bosses and killing them instantly after they spawned, but again, we're a few months past launch and the population has spread out across the levels rather than everyone being tightly packed into the same areas which is an issue with all brand new MMOs and their expansions.I could go on for ages about all the things I love about ESO, but suffice it to say, if you love Elder Scrolls (and Skyrim especially), you love MMO's and you're not going to cry that your immersion is ruined when a couple players charge into the crypts and rush that boss with you, you'll love ESO. Now that the price has dropped significantly, there's no reason not to at least try it for your free month and see how you like it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTUSS","description":"","reviewerName":"Aaron Schug","summary":"Responsive, Comfortable, Reliable","reviewText":"FeelThese new controllers feel great all around. You wouldn't think that a controller could improve much from the Xbox 360 but Microsoft figured it out. The sticks feel lighter and are much more responsive. The bumpers are positioned slightly differently which is nice in my opinion because to press them, I simply roll my finger up so I don't have to literally pick my finger up off the triggers to press them. The other buttons feel great as well. Another huge improvement is the grip on the sticks. The grip seems to last much longer and feels better than the older controllers. The plastic where your hands go feels very nice as well, it doesn't feel too slippery, even after hours of gameplay. The infared feature is nice too, the Xbox One can see who is playing depending on who is holding the controller. My favorite improvement would have to be the triggers with the new rumble feature. That improves the feel of the game 10-fold in my opinion. Its great to be playing a game like forza, slightly drifting off the track on the right or left side and the triggers will rumble accordingly making you feel more connected to the car in the game. The rumble changes according to what weapon you use in FPS too. I still have a couple Xbox 360's, when I play games on them such as halo, the controllers feel heavy and non-responsive compared to these new ones.Charge/reliabilityI bought the Nyko charge base which came with 2 rechargeable batteries, they last a very long time, much longer than the previous Xbox 360 controllers. I have put many hours into these controllers and so far they work just as well as they did the day I got them.LookThese new controllers sure look slick. They center Xbox One logo has a very cool looking lumination that looks chrome when the light is off. The A,B,X, and Y buttons are one of the best looking features of the controller having a 3D inlay. The rest of the controller looks fantasic as well, with gloss and dull black plastic fused together, it looks agressive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002NIP6X8","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Tragic game","reviewText":"Two things to note as of now: Review is subject to change as I advance in gameplay.The negative of this game is just too much for me to sit back and wait out more gameplay.  However, as I can edit the star rating and content of reviews, I may edit this to be of a sharply different tone later.However, even this early in the game, I can say this game is tragic, in the sense that the seeming attempts at something \"new\" and revolutionary are its downfall.First I want to note that \"NEW\" and \"INNOVATIVE\" doesn't automatically correlate to \"GOOD\".  Replacing an assault rifle with a bolt-action laser gun is NEW and INNOVATIVE, but you're sure as hell not going to consider the laser gun superior to the assault rifle just because of that.And so, C&C4; has apparently taken from the Dawn of War II gameplay style.  Namely, virtually 30-40% of the gameplay of a normal C&C; game is now gone.That is not a good thing---base management wasn't just a fun timewaster of balancing power plants with technology buildings and such; the building of buildings made it possible to establish yourself on a field of battle and realistically deal with things like attrition, travel, re-supply and reinforcement issues in travel, and defense in numbers.  By that, the numerous buildings you have essentially is their best defense when your troops and defensive buildings fail---the enemy will target your War Factory, so you can mass-build powerful infantry to destroy them once they're finished.Here, there's only one building, the poorly named \"Crawler\".  I say poorly named because it rarely ever crawls, and there's three models of it---one model has wheels, the other flies.This is your construction yard, power plant, war factory, tech center, barracks, everything but defensive buildings, which can be built separately.This means if you lose it, you're gone.  I think you can deploy a new one if you lose one, but you essentially have to start over again in terms of \"base\" construction and technology.While it wasn't realistic to magically create a military city out of a big fat truck, neither is it realistic to conduct an entire battle on 5 tanks and a big fat truck that deploys into a fortress and packs up with absolutely no consequences in terms of time, money, credit, points, anything.Even worse, there's NO mixing and matching of units.  That means, if you pick one Crawler type, all you'll get is tanks.  If you pick a different one, all you'll get is infantry.  The other one, all you'll get is air units.A slight mention: Graphics.Graphics are nowhere near as cartoony as other reviewers are mentioning.  The landscape comes nowhere close to the bright, frilly colors of Red Alert 3, and is much closer to the original Command & Conquer 3, but with a fresh vibrancy to the tones that is not only much more pleasant to look at from the bleak shades of gray and beige of C&C3;, but slightly more realistic.The units, however, is where the cartooniness is apparent...They've undergone the same process by which the units of Red Alert transformed in Red Alert 2.  Namely, they're like caricatures of their old selves, made stout and fat where they were once lean and limber.The Scorpion tank has literally been redesigned to look like a scorpion, complete with claws and a stinger.  It's just too stupid-looking to take seriously.  A flying unit literally looks and moves like a wasp with its stinger underneath it.  It's just too comical to consider a threat.  Raiders are shorter, stouter, and overall fatter than they used to be.  Stealth Tanks no longer look sleek and stealthy, but their missile boxes are now huge and clunky-looking.  Avatars no longer look lean and dangerous, but have their arms needlessly stiffened, and made to stick out on their sides, like 1950s cardboard refridgerator robots rather than the loose, limber cyborg that could grab things in C&C3.;  C&C4;'s Avatar couldn't pick up anything.There is a tactic that I feel made the Age of Empires II knockoff \"Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds\" impossible to enjoy; it was a gamebreaker that the expansion pack \"Clone Campaigns\" just disgustingly exacerbated to such a degree that anyone who used this tactic would almost always win, guaranteed:Fortressing.  That is, the building of heavy buildings capable of production very close to an enemy base, camping out there, and mass-building as much artillery as you can to blow apart an enemy base without them ever able to stop you without loads and loads of units and the sacrifice of several buildings.That is the ONLY tactic you can do here.  Another reviewer mentioned turtling was an option, but this tactic is weak and pathetic---you're SEVERELY limited in the number of anything you can build, and any determined enemy can crush your turtled base unless you have all your forces there to counter them.  This COMPLETELY defeats the purpose of turtling to begin with.But what really destroys the game is the unit caps.  Not at all going by the more player-friendly Blizzard Starcraft or Warcraft II limit of 200 population, this game will arbitrarily established a limit that is made further tinier by the fact that the SINGLE MOST BASIC TANK YOU CAN BUILD TAKES UP SIX POP POINTS!  SIX!Another reviewer argued that this was a good thing, for it reduced the dreaded TANK SPAM that would propogate earlier C&C; games.  I point out strongly that it propogated EARLY C&C; games.  The more recent games had better balance for countering this.  Just yesterday I was playing a mission in Red Alert 3 Uprising where I attempted a tank spam attack on a Japanese enemy, and because I was so numerous, they were able to destroy large swaths of my tanks, due simply to the fact that there were so many of them, they could be easily destroyed in cross-fire and splash damage.But the restrictions here are TOO MUCH!  In just the third mission, the first where I choose GDI, I'm expected to defend 12 refugee trucks going all the way across the map.  Along the way, enemy forces appear EEEEEVERYYWHEEEEERE to attack them.  And I only have 9 units to defend them with.I'm literally rushing these 5 tanks and 4 infantry all across the map back and forth while they dangle between red health and orange health, just to DISTRACT enemy guns from shooting at refugee trucks.This mission shows that the general gameplay, short of a one on one encounter, is not at all a test of who has the better command ability and strategies, but who has the most units---it doesn't matter if my units are better or I am a human against a computer AI, they have more than one Crawler, so they can produce more units, so I cannot win, period.GDI, the technological powerhouse, is reduced to having what a ragtag milita would consider a piece of trash outfit, HARASSING NOD FORCES to keep them from destroying TWELVE REFUGEE TRUCKS.Tragic.In fact, the very next mission is yet another exercise in face-palming stupidity, fortressing tactics, and nothing to do but literally TANK SPAM!  Because the tanks would get killed just as quickly as they were produced.  And the mission after that was like the first one---you need to capture THREE TCNs, in much the same way you would Control Points in Dawn of War.  Every five minutes, TWO NOD Crawlers spawn.  When they do, they start insta-building units, and rushing at you and the TCNs.  There is no strategy or tactics to be had here other than to destroy the crawlers and run as fast as you can to secure all three of them at once, which gives you no way to counter ANYTHING ANYWHERE.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003EZ1KGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Amazing Experience, More Than Just a Shoot Up Game.","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game a lot more than I expected.  I also thought it would be much shorter based on some of the other reviews saying the main campaign was only 5 or 6 hours, but I probably spent a good 15 hours on it.  Of course I started out on suicidal setting so I spent a lot of time dying and trying again.  To me this was a lot more fun than just lazily going through and shooting everything that moved and being done in only a few hours.Things I really were impressed by:1. The graphics are really nice.  Very realistic, extremely detailed and advanced.  The sandstorms were really impressive.2. The sound is amazing.  You hear flags flapping in the wind, trees rustling, sand blowing.  All of these elements working together, sound and visual make for a really immersive experience.3. Voice quality.  The voice acting was really nice!4. Story was really well thought out.  Normally I would expect a game like this to be you're the good guy killing the bad guys and its just that simple, except its not that simple.  Nothing is what it appears to be and theres some really nice twists and turns, especially at the end.  The story kept me engaged, interested and surprised. The pacing of the game and story were good as well.  Intense action with some times to slow down for a minute to catch your breath, then pick back up again.5. Characters were well developed.  You really got a good feel for the primary characters and they were nicely done.6. The loading screens had little sayings on them and I found many to be very insightful and interesting.  A lot of little clues and foreshadowing in them if you read them right.7. The game has a lot of psychological focus which is nice.  The horrors of war, the choices people make in battle and the moral consequences are all very nicely played out.  So the results of things like killing children or unarmed people, etc.  Yeah, you get to do that and live with the regrettable feelings of it.  Fun!8. The fog of war is well done.  There's no map telling you where your enemies are and its not always clear right away whats going on and what you need to do.  You might find yourself flanked if you're not paying attention.  I found the sandstorms were amazing immersive experiences that felt intense and exciting and brought a new element to the battles rather than just shoot A, shoot B, etc.9. I've tried multiplayer a couple of times.  I really enjoyed it.  I played a free for all game and a team game.  Got my butt kicked both times but it wasn't too hard to find other players, it was a good time and unlike other multiplayer games in which people complain if you're new or not that good.  This one was just run around and do your best.  Maybe th other people were complaining about me, but if they were, I didn't have to hear about it!Things I wasn't as happy about:1. The loading screen, especially after you die seems to take a while.  I'm on a fairly new quad core i7 too.  Maybe I'm just impatient.  I mean it didn't take forever, like a minute or two, but when you're sitting there waiting, a minute or two can seem like a lot longer.2. I'm a little more used to enjoying open world games like GTA.  This is more like a path.  You go from point A to point B.  There may be different ways to get there.  Vaulting over things, rappeling, ziplining, etc, but you're on a path and there's no deviation from that path.  There's nothing wrong with this style of gameplay, I still found the game enjoyable, I just am used to being able to go off the path a little more.3. Even with my 15 hours of campaign, it was a little on the short side.  So if I had breezed through it on an easier setting and finished up in 5 or 6 hours that would have been even more dissapointing.  Maybe I'm spoiled but I like to see a good 40 or 50 hours in a campaign, or at least have a number of scenario options as well that you can play out. It could be that they were counting on multiplayer being the real meat of this thing.4. I tried to look at the Co-op mode.  Maybe I just didn't understand it but there didn't seem to be anything going on over there.5. There were times during the story that I didn't want to take a certain action, but the game doesn't give me the choice, in order to move forward I had to do something that I knew I wouldn't want to do.  It would have been nice to have the option to opt out of a morally questionable choice or to have a worse consequence for trying to do that.  I guess they had to tell the story though.I bought this as a download at another site for $5.99 and there's no question it was well worth it at that price.  I think anything under $15.00 for me personally, this would be a good value.  So if you're thinking about it, I strongly recommend you take the plunge and try it because if you like these kinds of games, I think you'll be very impressed with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}

Combat takes cues from Metal Gear Solid 4 and it's forbearers. The story is novelistic with unforgiving despair as the characters fight tooth and nail for every inch to survive.  The Last of Us is, in many ways, the type of game Bioshock Infinite wishes it could be.  While Infinite threw it's lofty narrative aspirations out the window in favor of tired corridor shooting gallery conflicts, The Last of Us goes all in from every aspect of gameplay to drive the story forward.In The Last of Us, there is no open world.  There are few branching paths.  The controls are simple and fairly guided.  Planks and ladders show up alarmingly often.  The pacing hits walls, particularly after the brutal opening, and we trod along for an hour doing very little.  But as you advance deeper into the story, the early hours become a distant memory and the opening lulls seem surprisingly appropriate with the encounters that lie ahead.There's some golden nuggets in this game.  It isn't in the presentation, with artfully executed graphics, the jagged edges and soft textures do in fact show the age for what the PS3 can render compared to PC games these days.  It isn't in the gameplay with an abundance of button prompts and guided movements.  It isn't in the story, because we've seen this all in the book and movie of The Road and The Walking Dead.  No, the ace in the hole for The Last of Us is the immersive and unforgiving atmosphere.  It's potent and hard to overcome, even when you turn the PS3 off to go wash dishes.  There was something familiar about the world of The Last of Us, because it felt like Half-Life 2.  The sparse environments, cordoned off cities, armored cops and most obviously clickers taken right out of the Zombie enemies from HL2. It's a great homage, and minus the sci-fi, the two worlds feel like they could easily be connected with Gordon Freeman out there a few blocks away braving ditches, tunnels and overturned buses in his own battle of survival.As long as you don't expect any blisteringly paced gunfights, Mario-style platforming and Uncharted level explosions, The Last of Us is an exercise in immersion.  This is such a dark story that when you crawl from darkness into the light in one set piece to another, it is a revelatory feeling of hope and accomplishment.  That is, until you crouch down and hear a gang of clickers around the bend. It is then, you realize carrying one beer bottle and three Magnum bullets the hope fades.  There will be no 1-Ups, airstrikes or magic capes to save you.  In the Last of Us, you have only one life to fight for.  And after that opening scene, perhaps only a half-life.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

A MUST PLAY if you own a PS3.","reviewText":"Don't buy a lot of PS3 games. I use it more as a blu ray player. I haven't bought a PS3 game on launch day since Uncharted around 6 years ago. After seeing early reviews and finding an awesome sale price, I had to give it a try. One of the best games I've played...ever. As an older gamer, I don't have much time to play adventure games like this but found myself playing this nonstop. Instead of talking about awesome: graphics, backround details, sound, voices/voice acting, music, gameplay, cinemas, enemy A.I., controls, etc, just gonna talk about the my personal experience (despite all the bugs I've heard about like the one I encountered when one of my new weapons disappeared...yes I know you hold X to select another weapon).Story - One of the best stories ever made in a video game. Very well done. Just like playing a great Walking Dead/Virus outbreak/Zombie movie. Many emotional ups and downs. Seen some reviewers I've read and seen have stated getting so emotional they cried during some scenes and dialog. Haven't felt so into a game and involved in a being part of game since Alan Wake and Bioshock 1.Setting - You get so involved at all the different places and beauty/ugliness in this new world. You feel like you're playing a big part of a movie or book. You go through many cities, large buildings, houses, sewers, bases, etc. Great environments and scenery that can be very interactive.Characters Development - Excellent and awesome character development with everyone in this game. You so many unique people through your journey. Some that also join you during your quest. Great personalities, conversation, being interactive that really stick with you. Not just thrown in as they get pretty involved in part of the story. Very powerful and emotional. You actually care that they are as part of your quest.Joel and Elle - One of the best character duos in video game history. Their relationship is so up and down but they learn to deal with each and work together. Very emotional moments between them. Ellie is one of the best partners in video game history. Not in terms as a bad ass marine or warrior as the ones in many FPS games (although she kinda is in her own way). She is very unique in personality. She grew up in this new world. Because of that, one of the best aspects in this game is that she interacts in many differ ways such as: many many conversations with you that can be very emotional, other people you meet on the way, environments, items, objects, writing, collectables, etc. Never seen a character like this before...ever. Joel is basically a bad ass bitter old man w/ bad attitude due to past drama.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2013"}

Such a fun and exciting ride, think of the best action adventure movie or game youve seen and multiply that by 100 and you get Uncharted 2! Some say its not really replayable but I just ran through it twice straight (and Im still enjoying watching the cutscenes). Also the graphics, weapons and (simple) controls scheme are really good and make the gunfights really fun, so I do find it very replayable. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game and enjoy.

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"justice4all72","summary":"Controls Are TERRIBLE","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I was looking forward to this game for months.

The new sprint button is garbage it makes to run so damn fast that when u need to stop and jump you die cuz mario cant control himself. In the old days it was jump and run that was all.

I bought this system because I was tired of having to deal with my 360 freezing all of the time. I literally spend more reseting the 360 than playing games on it; because a game would freeze or it would get a disc read error......  PS3's only real competition is the Wii IMO, as well as the profit margin for Sony.Pros:  Blu Ray playback is stunning.  This particular system is quiet.  USB cable for the controller is included.  Games run smoothly.  There aren't proprietary cables that you need to buy if you want to use the HDMI and/or Optical Sound outputs.  Game graphics are top notch.Cons:  You need to use the RB/Y cable to be able to set up the other video outputs, and vise versa.  You have to change the sound settings in order to switch between the RY, Optical, and HDMI sound outputs.  It takes an extremely long time to update the system no matter which media you use, and it has update errors sometimes.  Every game I've bought has needed an update before it could be played.I would recommend this system over the 360 any day.

Basically this is what video games should be, a lot of fun and an enjoyable escape from reality. I also must add, there is a lot of cursing, however after you get into the game it really just becomes background noise and you really don't notice it much. The violence aspect is over the top, but in a very animated sense, kind of like a grownups version of Looney Tunes.Surprisingly, the story isn't that bad. I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't really expecting much because of the type of game it is or if it was actually a good story on its own merits, but either way the bottom line is it was pretty good. There was just as much action as there was character development, you actually felt as if you were fighting for something and someone at the same time.The AI is as dumb as a box of rocks, not really much of a challenge. This game really wasn't meant to blow you away with incredible AI, they were meant to be used as target practice and nothing more. When you hear them speak, this is made pretty evident; you're not dealing with Einstein here, more like Frankenstein.The environments are beautifully rendered, lots of detail and variety. The character models are a little stiff but not bad, let's just say you won't be mistaking them for real people.Believe it or not, with all that is happening on the screen during a typical gun fight, the aiming system is pretty accurate. Most of the time, you are able to pull off the desired skill shots with little to no hassle at all. The game's controls are tight, not too difficult to learn nor too complicated during the long run, ultimately pretty fluid and user friendly.The online aspect of this game is different than most, you won't find your typical team deathmatch here. I will tell you though; the multiplayer portion is a lot more fun with friends than it is with random people. You will be entertained, but I don't know if you'll spend Call of Duty hours playing online here in the Bulletstorm world.If I could compare this game to anything else currently on the market, it would be a mash up of MadWorld, Gears of War and Borderlands, and if you ask me borrowing elements from those titles isn't a bad thing at all. If you're looking for a good time, nothing too serious, pick this game up, you won't be disappointed.By the way, in case you were wondering, the title is an inside joke for Xbox 360 players.Michael","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}

This game is just plain fun.This is what Fallout 3 would have been if there was a multiplayer mode.This is another game set off in the far flung dystopina future, you are being guided around the planet Pandora by a mysterious static voice of a woman looking for an equally mysterious vault. That's all you need to know.The rest of the game is simply, if it moves, kill it and collect the loot.The game is simplistic and deep at the same time.  Amazingly the first 10 levels you play won't even take you that far from your startpoint as you learn how to choose your weapons, fight at least 3 bosses, learn how to drive vehicles and so forth.Grphically speaking, the cel shading art is pretty good but sometimes I still longed for the 'realistic' approach given to Fallout.Multiplayer handles pretty well with very little lag and sometimes battles can get hectic really quick.If I can give any minuses to the game, it would be these.Enemies that are MUCH lower in level to you can still wield a large amount of damage on you and even though you can be a level 10 character and kill a level 4 enemy with ease, that level 4 enemy can still deal large amounts of damage quickly and moreso in a swarm.This is possibly the only major thing that unbalances the game.The other is sometimes it takes a few button clicks to reload ( I think this is a skill thing) and sometimes you have to highlight a drop item 'just so' to pick it up.The driving controls are a bit clunky and takes practice just to get it to go straight but hey, you didn't get this game to go driving!My only other major issue is that I have as of yet not seen anyplace to store your loot and I am not sure of this was intentional or not but games of this sort always allowed you to have some type of storage system because you never know if that 'one' gun you found earlier may be needed later...however I am guessing that with the amount of stuff available you sell it more than keep.We also as of yet not seen a way to swap weapons between players short of dropping it on the ground, hopefully this may be remedied later as by doing this mean you need to be playing with people you trust.Now, the skill tree is the coolest and easiest I have seen to use.  You have to make sure you stick to whichever one you choose to flesh out and get the max skills for your character.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end?

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"A review from someone who actually finished the game","reviewText":"Borderlands is an open world sci-fi setting role-playing shooter. If you're a co-op player like me, this is the pinnacle of co-op gaming. If you found playing Fallout 3 a lonely experience, Borderlands is the cure.You can choose from four archetypes: Roland the Soldier, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren, and Brick the Berserker. I played Mordecai and my brother played Brick. The archetypes have skill trees reminiscent of D20 Modern's talent trees.  Up to five points can be spent on each level of the tree, which in turn branches access to more powerful skills. In this way skills build on each other and characters become highly customizable.The cell-shaded graphics are reminiscent of Crackdown.  This allows some fun introductory sequences when villains get their own close-ups.  Unfortunately, Borderlands doesn't make enough use of these interesting personalities. Combining boss battles in open world environments allows for some less-than-heroic battles - twice we sniped a boss to death.The planet of Pandora is largely a Wild West setting with a sci-fi sheen. I'm a sucker for pets, so I really enjoyed Moredcai's killer bird Bloodwing. My brother, who enjoys being the tank, had a blast punching people to death as Brick.What makes Borderlands so much fun is how effortlessly it combines the various aspects of open world game play, first person shooters, and role-playing games. There aren't really merchants to speak of, just vending machines, but that makes sense in a dangerous environment like Pandora. There are vehicles, but you aren't required to drive them. The weapons are the usual variety of elemental type + fire rate + damage + shield penetration, but like Fallout each has an amusing manufacturer that helps distinguish them from each other.Borderlands perfected monster difficulty; spawned opponents are always a match for your characters. Quests are shared across the co-op feature of up to four players, and there are plenty of side quests to keep players busy for awhile.The story has a lot of promise: Our four mercenaries land on Pandora to find the Vault, a cache of alien weapons technology that only opens every 200 years. The planet itself is in a post-gold rush phase, having stripped the planet of all valuable resources. With summer heralding the return of Pandora's predators and little incentive to colonize, the corporations set all prisoners free.  A combination of convicts, bloodthirsty animals, and rival mercenaries keep things interesting.That should be the end of the review, right?  Five stars, everyone go back to your consoles. How could you screw something up that's this good?SPOILER VAULT: Throughout the various quests a mysterious woman appears to provide guidance as to how to find the Vault. In a game that's all about leveling, greed, and power we were rubbing our hands together wondering what awesome weapons we would find there.  But we found nothing.  Why?  Because there's nothing in the vault but a cheap Lovecraftian knockoff.Borderlands should be a five star game. There were no less than six writers working on this setting, but it's clear Gearbox put most of its resources into coding the world. Instead, Borderlands trips at the finish line by turning an entire game built around power leveling into some philosophical battle against creatures from beyond.  The boss isn't even a challenge.  There's a quick cut to a sequel that wasn't actually explored until the fourth DLC, but robot ninjas do not make up for a lame ending.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly good","reviewText":"With Marvel making huge splashes in movies and video games, DC has began to follow through, with some very good results.  Justice League Heroes allows to play as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and Zatanna (yes, Zatanna, fishnets, top hat, and magic spells and all) as you take on Brainiac and other baddies.  Unlike other comic licensed games, Justice League Heroes isn't necessarily a generic beat 'em up.  Instead, the game sort of follows the X-Men Legends/Marvel Ultimate Alliance formula by injecting a sense of strategy into the gameplay along with some RPG elements.  The environments are wonderfully done, and there's a great roster of villains to take on (including Doomsday), and while the voice acting doesn't include any of the talent from the hit animated show, the actors here (including Ron \"Hellboy\" Perlman as Batman and one time Spawn Michael Jai White) do a great job.  Each heroes' powers are nicely implemented, and the game looks good to boot, not to mention that the game is surprisingly easy to pick up and play.  The only real drawbacks to Justice League Heroes is that it's easy and a bit on the short side, and why of all Justice League members is Zatanna included over heavy hitters like Green Arrow, Captain Marvel, Firestorm, Hawkgirl or Hawkman?  Despite all that, Justice League Heroes is a more than solid game that does it's license justice (no pun intended), and is more than worth picking up for any comic fan looking to get away from Marvel Ultimate Alliance for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2006"}

It created such a following that can only be compared to that of UNREAL and the original HALF-LIFE. CRYTEK, the developer of both FAR CRY and CRYSIS, clearly did not rest on its laurels. CRYSIS is an *EVEN BETTER GAME* in many aspects.And toping FAR CRY is NOT an easy task...Graphically the game is GORGEOUS! (Both DX10 and DX9 compatible). Moving in the jungle is just unbelievable: the natural foliage, the game of light and shadow, the clear flowing water...The weapons are exceptionally well designed (familiar shapes but mostly futuristic) and their muzzle flashes add to the game realism. Replenishing your ammo is almost never a problem, provided you are frugal with your snipper bullets. A nice cross-genre touch: most weapons are enhanceable with targeting-lasers, sniper-sights and silencers.The \"weapon\" you will enjoy more is, of course, the nanite-muscle-suit, a kind of augmenting exoskeleton that serves as both armor and turning you into a super-human. Throwing your enemies over the tree tops can be really fun - and their limp movements and shouted insults are totally realistic! Speaking of realism, wait to reach the zero-gravity levels: the weapons' kick will propel you backwards - as it should! And, very important, all these great graphics with steep yet not exorbitant system requirements! CRYSIS is much more stable than, say, FEAR-PERSEUS MANDATE or BIOSHOCK, although graphically clearly superior.The sound has also been well worked on. There are a number of moments where sound clues are the warning you will get. The sound of an enemy crawling towards you is not a good omen...So get rid of those old headphones and plug in a good set of speakers.The levels are beautifully designed and the AI PHENOMENAL! I had a group of enemies flank me as I was engaged with their comrade who was left as bait! Shoot an enemy from cover only to watch him seek cover as well - until he or one of his comrades spot your position!Overall, the gameplay controls is very similar to that of FAR CRY (and most FPS nowadays). I do have to point out that movement is precise and effective. Running is fast whereas crouching is stealthy. For longer distances, vehicles become available.The game also sports a multiplayer - although it may require lowering the video specs to avoid lagging.Now, this game (being an EA release) sports ...SecuROM. Usually I subtract at least two stars from games burdening us with such dangerous security routines. However, I liked the game so much I felt torn - and decided to make an exception. So, if you are boycotting SecuROM games, be warned, otherwise:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}

Kennedy","summary":"Best Handheld Kingdom Hearts to Date","reviewText":"I have been a Kingdom Hearts fan since I bought the first game the day it came out. While I started to loose faith in the handheld titles, Birth by Sleep recaptured the imagination and amazing storytelling that sucked me into the series. The same team was put in charge of this title, and I truly hope they are in charge of the inevitable Kingdom Hearts 3 we have already waited 6 years for. I don't want to spoil anything, but as with all Kingdom Hearts titles you can guess the entire story from the intro video. Luckily this time it included the main plot points from every previous title in the series.This game:The graphics are amazing, even better than the PS2 sequences. The 3d adds even more depth to an already amazing game. I have 10 3ds games including LoZ:OoT, Starfox, and Mario 3d Land. Kingdom Hearts 3D definitely is the best 3d game I have seen to date.Flow motion is a bit hard to get used to at first, but by the end of the first level it will be your main source of damage to enemies. If you were annoyed as I was at times at how long it took to get across the vast Kingdom Hearts maps, you will love this feature.The Dream Eaters are cool in concept, and definitely make controlling Riku more awesome (try giving him wings). However, the developers attempted to make them Nintendogs meet Tomogatchi. Which means to make them truly useful in combat you need to show them affection and play minigames to fully power them up. Luckily to beat the game you don't technically have to participate in this side activity, but all of your stat boosts are dependent on doing this.Spoiler for those who know nothing of the game/% There are seven worlds, each needs to have its keyhole locked to have Sora and Riku finish their Mark of Mastery Exam. Each world is split into two parts such that Sora and Riku can play the same world from different storylines and perspectives. %\\ Each of the worlds in the game are \"new.\" Even Traverse Town has a new and expanded twist with the addition of The World Ends With You characters and Shibuya style.Dropping is my least favorite part of the game, but it does help propel the story. It takes a few drops to really get used to (especially if you are like me and attempt to grab every treasure chest on the first play through), but it forces you to keep up with the stories of both Sora and Riku. As much as dropping annoys me, I remember KH Chain of Memories where you had to play as Riku after Sora by which point you probably forgot part of the story. Or Birth by Sleep where you had to play the game from 3 different perspectives. The nice thing is that if you fall behind with a character, you can \"drop\" early and switch back to the other character.Overall Kingdom Hearts 3D takes a little while to get used to, but once you get past the first hour or so of gameplay you will find so much to love. The character development, graphics, and battle system make this the most unique and arguably best handheld Kingdom Hearts to date. I have high hopes for what Square Enix will do with the third installment of this amazing series.First time Kingdom Hearts Players: While I think the team did a great job of making the intro video tell the main story of the game, there is a lot of story to catch up on. I would suggest either finding a website with a description of the main parts of each game (most of the storyline will be \"spoiled\" by playing this game anyway), or make sure to read every report in your journal as you collect it. If you don't care about storyline, then this is a perfect starting point in the series. The battle system and worlds are a lot of fun, even if you don't know exactly what is going on in the grand scheme of things.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2012"}

Rhodes","summary":"Exploring a Galaxy Never Felt So Good","reviewText":"The Playstation 2 has tons of RPGs.  When a new one marches forth most RPGers can usually say \"Yep\" or \"Nope.\"  Rogue Galaxy is definitely a \"Yep.\"  It's easy to grasp, yet difficult to master.  It's shorthanded in some key areas which keep it from being perfect, but it's still one of the best RPGs to come around in a while.Rogue Galaxy follows the story of Jaster.  Jaster dreams of exploring the galaxy someday.  He more than gets his chance after having a run in with a Bounty Hunter, and then being mistaken for said bounty hunter.  In all honesty, Rogue Galaxy doesn't have a great storyline.  It's certainly not horrible, but it's standard.  It's also full of predictable plot points, and it actually lacks a little in the character development.  These two aspects of any RPG are crucial.  Whether you want to accept it or not, story and character development are important, and Rogue Galaxy lacks both.  It's sad because you'll meet a lot of characters who are interesting.  The problem is that you just don't learn enough about them.Luckily, the game is saved by the sheer fun factor that comes with the battle system.  Unlike other RPGs, Rogue Galaxy doesn't have you running around and then there's a transition into a random battle.  Rather, enemies just pop up and you take a battle stance right in the area you're exploring.  It's very similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.  When in battle you'll be able to jump around, slash as your enemies and switch between primary and secondary weapons.  Your primary weapon is usually a melee weapon, while your secondary is a projectile.  Battling is fast paced and fun.  It deviates away from the menu based combat that has dominated RPGs over the past couple of decades.Battling isn't entirely simple, though.  The game is quite a challenge in many regards.  First, there's the emphasis on strategy.  This is more than just you smacking an enemy until it dies.  Some enemies you'll have to expose their weakness in some way before you can start dealing damage to them.  Some only take damage from certain weapons.  There is a definite emphasis on strategy.  Your characters will often give you hints on what to do as well.You only control one character in combat.  The others are controlled by AI.  Unfortunately this is another aspect where Rogue Galaxy falls short.  Your allies are hardly aggressive.  There will be plenty of moments where you'll have to revive your AI controlled characters.  There are moments where the game's difficulty is so high that reviving and healing characters becomes a constant chore.  This is mostly apparent in boss battles.  Which brings up another factor that can make or break the experience of Rogue Galaxy.  Leveling up also feels like a chore sometimes.  It takes a lot of battling to level up.  It's fun, thank goodness, but much like Dragon Quest VIII there are times when you'll spend more time level grinding than progressing through the game.  Some RPGers will love this challenge, but others may not be patient enough to do so much level building.  The game is long as it is, and so much more of it requires the player to be dedicated to level grinding.  For the most part, though, it's still a fun game to play, and the battle system is so much more involving than other RPGs out there.Another factor to aid the battle system and peak the interest of any RPGer is the weapon fusion.  As you go through the game, your weapons also level up.  They can be be fused with other weapons to make more powerful weapons.  So much of Rogue Galaxy isn't so much dependent on your defense as much as it is your offense.  So it's a good idea to fuse some good weapons.  However, weapon fusing isn't completely fun and games.  There's no way for you to become a God right from the get go with weapons.  Factors such as the weapon type, weapon level, your characters skill with the weapon etc. play a pivotal role.  So even if you created a really powerful weapon early on, your character may not be skilled enough to wield it.  This works very well, because it keeps the game from becoming too easy too fast.Rogue Galaxy also offers a complex ability system called \"Revelations.\"  Each character has a Revelations Flow Chart.  By buying certain items and placing them in the Revelations Flow Chart, your characters will learn abilities, and other parts of the Flow Chart will open up for them.  Like a lot of the game, it's actually pretty simple to learn.  This is what's nice about Rogue Galaxy.  It's easy to pick up and play.There are some pretty cool optional quests that you can do throughout the game.  You can collect bugs that can be used in a stadium (very similar to Pokemon), go on bounty missions, explore other planets.  Rogue Galaxy is a pretty big game all on its own.  The main quest is big enough, but some of the secrets and extras are enough to rival the Final Fantasy games.Visually, Rogue Galaxy is one of the most artistic and beautiful looking games out there.  It has a beautiful cel-shaded look very similar to Dragon Quest VIII. The environments are detailed and pretty.  The fact of how exploration is done is also fantastic.  Instead of just roaming around you'll have to jump up platforms and such as well. There are better looking games, but the style of this one is what makes the graphics stand out.  Load times also feel non-existent.  Since battles take place in exploration, and the game's cutscenes don't have to load (because there are no flashy FMVs), there's not much the game really has to load.Speaking of which, the sound and audio quality is really good.  There are times when the soundtrack feels like it isn't big enough, but you'll enjoy what you get from it, regardless.  The voice acting is also done really well, even if a lot of dubbing is off more so than other RPGs.The point is simple: With video games moving on to newer systems, it's nice to see that the Playstation 2 hasn't been left in the dust, and that Rogue Galaxy really is a high quality RPG.  It may not have the best story in the world, or the best characters, but it's a huge game, with tons of things to do.  The sheer amount of fun you'll have with this game is a testament to it's good quality.Pros:+Beautiful Looking Game+Great soundtrack+Good voice acting+Tons of sidequests and optional things to do+Very engaging battle system+Load times feel non-existent+The game is a good overall challenge+Weapon fusion is deeper than most RPGs that try to do the same thingCons:-Predictable storyline-Not enough character development-AI controlled characters don't do enough-Some boss battles are unreasonably challenging-A huge emphasis on level grinding, but you won't get enough experience from most of these enemies","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Enhanced Control Still Has Room for Improvement","reviewText":"When Resident Evil 4 came out in 2005 it absolutely blew me away. The game was and still is spectacular. On the GameCube it was a showcase for the processing power of the system, on the Wii the graphics look rather muddy and dated which is why players shouldn't pay more than the bargain price of twenty dollars for this game. When RE4 was initially released my only issue with the game was that it wasn't scary. Rather than dwell on the various merits or deficiencies of the game I decided to focus on just one aspect which is surely the biggest enhancement for the Wii version, that being control.Anyone who has played first person shooters on both game consoles and PC's knows that the PC is the undisputed king. The mouse/keyboard combination has never been equaled by any game controller. It's been a few years since I played Resident Evil 4 on my GameCube but my initial reaction was that the Wii remote was a sizable improvement.  The Wii remote feels much more precise and intuitive than the GC controller but it still falls short of the mouse/keyboard combination. When you want to fire your weapon you need to hold the B button and press A. The problem is that when B is held your character is immobilized. The nunchuck controller switches from controlling your body motion to controlling the pivoting of your torso. You can turn in any direction for firing including up down, left and right but your feet are cemented to the ground so no running and gunning. Ironically even with both hands controlling the targeting reticule I still found myself getting occasionally tied up. The other problem is that you can't move sideways regardless of whether B is held down so no strafing or peeking into a room to check for enemies. These are not just subtle deficiencies.The advantage that the PC has is that a characters foot movement is controlled by the keyboard whereas the direction and speed are controlled using the mouse. This ties the direction and the weapon reticule since they're operated simultaneously but that's ok. The Wii remote separates the reticule and the motion but when you target something you lose the advantage of the separation so there is no net gain. If Capcom had controlled the characters direction using the Wii remote rather than the nunchuck it may have worked better although I doubt it would have been as intuitive. I would also wonder if Capcom could have had characters turn based on the location of the reticule rather than using the nunchuck. In other words the players view would have turned to the right as the reticule moved to the right. Whether Capcoms solution is the best or not is debatable but what is hardly debatable is that there is still room for improvement.I'm a little behind the times on the Wii and just got one this past Christmas so this is the only first person shooter I've played. I'll have to see if EA or Activision managed to do a better job with controls.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2008"}

If you're new to Resident Evil...start out with Code Veronica X or Resident Evil 1 first. You have to know how to use your weapons in this game. You have to know how to be efficient with your cash to buy new weapons, upgrade them and so forth. There is plenty of ammo to kill everything. This game will make you jump no doubt. No zombies here, just twisted Texas Chainsaw M, or Wrong Turn cannibals after you! Then your enemies change to demonic monks and so forth. I beat it all the way through without cheating with the internet! Graphics are amazing, detailed! Long, long game with lot's of boss fights, none of which are terribly hard. Personally, I hate fighting the Tyrant in Resident Evil games. he is such a pain in the arse. Also, after beating, there are many sub-games unlocked for you to play afterwards!! For Wesker fans, he's here. A must have for anybody who likes the Resident Evil series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

The game types are: dogfight, team dogfight, capture the flag, keep away (a sort of tag-like game), team keep away, and wild chicken (a game similar to capture the flag, but with only one flag).The downside to live is that you're dependent on the number of other people online.  You can always find a dogfight game going on, but it's harder to find a keep away or wild chicken game going on at 7 on Sunday morning.The single player mode is good, but repetitive.  There's only so much flying and shooting you can do before you get tired of seemingly doing the same thing over and over again.  You can get into AA guns and fire from the ground or from vehicles, but overall this doesn't add too much in the way of variety.  The storyline is pretty ridiculous (not in the good way like odd world), and it lacks any sort of complexity.Overall, I really wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have x-box live.  It's got the great microsoft-title graphics (ala brute force or halo), so it's definately worth renting for that by itself.  But if you don't have the challenge of playing other people online, this game's playability is pretty thin.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2003"}

This game is One of the best wars games I have ever play not too cheesy to where you can call it a kids game but not to Realistic to where you get mad and dont't won't to play it. The charcters on this game are awesome and I think this game proves that Gaming companys are really out to make war games that can be played and enjoyed by people. First off I have to say say the campaign is a bit short even on vetran beet it on vetran in about 10 hours. Besides the fact of being a bit short The missions are awesome the guns are realistic The charcters really make you get attached to them and The enemys really make you want to kill them. Second off the Multiplay is pretty good would be better if I had playstation Network but it is still good.The maps on multiplayer are a bit small in my oponion but thats ok it just makes it easiers to find people. I would reccomend if playing Multiplay play on hardcore mode it dosen't show the others players on the minimap. That is if you like a challenge but if you don't like a challenge just play it on the regular mode. Next Arcade Mode I really hate arcade mode because it sees how fast you can beat the missions. When I play games I like to play at my own pace and not some timer. That is why I am glad the newer call of duty games have special ops.  That is the only Negative part of this game it is not bad enough for me to give this any thing but 5 stars.  I would reccomend this to any body who does not want to pay over $25 bucks for a good war game. Thank you for reading this review hope you found it helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}
