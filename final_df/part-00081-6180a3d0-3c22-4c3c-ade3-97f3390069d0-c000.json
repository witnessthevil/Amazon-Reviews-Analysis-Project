{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"Barry Robinson","summary":"A GAME LIKE THIS DOESN'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY!","reviewText":"Congratulations Lucas Arts and Pandemic on an outstanding game that outguns and outshines nearly all games of its type. Mercenaries is a 3rd person shooter thats packing more than just a cool subtitle, \"playground of destruction\", it literally is. Players will assume the roles of three different Mercenaries dropped into North Korea to take out \"the deck of 52\". This will be no easy task, yet a very rewarding one. Through accomplishing missions, whether by capturing your enemies or killing them, you'll earn points to buy new weapons, unlock secret players (Han Solo, Indiana Jones), and gain new abilities such as calling airstrikes. Mercenaries is a very lengthy game and will provide hours of entertainment, most of the time as you just blow the living crap out of everthing around you. But the game is deeper than that however, but you can take it as you please. For example, you can take on missions and earn money using helicopters, tanks, sports cars (every mission can be different every time) or you have the freedom to go on a rampage and make not only the citizens, but the factions, violently mad. The graphics in Mercenaries are awesome and seem a bit like Freedom Fighters mixed Star Wars Battlefront, as others have mentioned. They are awesome especially the explosions, particle effects, and ragdoll deaths. The sound is great and really gives off the feeling of a combat zone. This game is THE action title to own right now and unless you absolutley hate this type of game, you need to buy. Now, this game got a 9.1/10 from IGN and a 9/10 from PSM so its almost perfect and i give it a 10/10. People have compared Mercenaries to GTA but what game produced after GTA that involves cars, guns, and killing hasn't been compared to GTA, thats bound to happen. Its been compared to Socom...nah! Doesn't seem that way to me. It does seem alot like Freedom Fighters but on a way bigger scale. Just about the only thing that is lacking in this game is multiplayer. But that doesn't matter that much when you've got one of the greatest single player games on the PS2, but at least I've still got TimeSplitters 2 and Freedom Fighters for when I've got my friends over. So all in all, Mercenaries is one awesome game that will rock your PS2. Buy it if you are even the slightest bit entertained by action games. This is the ultimate action game. Thanks for reading...hope this review was helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}

I won a bet that I could survive longer then my friend on infinity mode in the first game.  I survived for 16 days and three hours or thereabouts.  So please no comments about me being a hypocrite,  I won a bet my friend bought me the game, if you want to talk about that, the discussion is their still for that purpose.1.  The game changes at a certain point, and after this change it is not as much fun,  It make me so angry, the way the game changed so drastically, and basically makes it impossible to do anything.2.  why do you drop certain items,  I am playing and I keep dropping my chain saws,  why is that a design feature,  it does not make sense,  you get attacked you drop the item, you accidently roll you drop the item, it is frustrating.3.  You should not take damage while your healing,  I have died so many times because people attack me while healing,  it does not make sense,  some of the enemies do not give you time to hide, and the whole animation takes five or six seconds.4.  Why does the game not pause while looking at you watch, you have to find a safe place whenever you want to check the clock.5.  The AI is even worse then the first game, I keep getting shot in the back,  as well as how retarded they are, some of them ask you to pay them to be rescued.6.  if any one played the case zero they made numerous changes to the game play,  such as making the people so slow, you have to stop to wait for them all the time,  what is the point of being fast if the AI IS SLOW7.  The bosses are silly and hard to beat, what is the point of an enemy that takes 10 shotgun blasts to kill,  or any other way of killing,  Same with zombies, it takes so many shots to kill them, but a bat does the job in two hits,  They try and push the whole melee weapons as the only choice.OK,  So I am playing through for the A ending first,  will update, with more positives, and the other features of the game later.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2010"}

B for kick, a for punch, and R1 for throws so you can imagine that you won't be able to pull off as many combos in the arcade. But despite that it's amazing how many of the regular characters' moves are actually in the game. You can still do cheapo air combos, play the hit and run game, or just tap your opponent constantly to annoy him. Characters included by default are Paul, Nina, Yoshimitsu, Jin, Hwoarang, King, Xiaoyu, Law, and Gun Jack with Heihachi as a boss. Graphics wise, it's pretty good although you can expect it to be pixelatted. Little worse looking than the original Tekken for PS1. You'l also notice the game feels a bit more sluggish than the PS2 or arcade versions of Tekken. Takes some getting used to but you'll probably eventually ignore this. It definitely doesn't have that smooth play feel like Tony Hawk. Fun factor for this game? Definitely a good port game for the Tekken player who's got time before finals or long waits at airports. The average player or Tekken haters probably might not like the game from the average/pixellated graphics or sluggish feeling controls at first. Still though, I loved the game being the Tekken fan that I am and it's nice to see my fav characters like Jin and Xiaoyu in a portable system. I just gotta wonder why in the world they included Gun Jack instead of Eddie Gordo? He'd have been a better choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2002"}

Johnson","summary":"The most unreliable piece of equipment I have ever owned.","reviewText":"My initial review of the XBOX 360 Pro was a few days after I purchased it in November of 2006. Since that time I have gone through four or five XBOX Pro consoles with problems ranging from no video on the screen to the games freezing for no reason at all. In addition to the XBOX Pro's failing, I have also had to have two XBOX Elites replaced or repaired since purchasing my first one in January of 2008.  The problem with the Elite consoles was that the shoddy DVD drives could fail to read Game CD's until after 30 - 40 tries of opening/closing the drives. In fact I have just boxed up my 2nd Elite console to send back to Microsoft. None of my XBOX Pro's have lasted more than seven months, and in terms of my XBOX Elite, it will be my THIRD in less than a year.I can go into every single reason why my XBOX's have failed but why bother when you can just as easily go to the multitudes of message boards and read the horror stories of this extremely unreliable console. When I purchased my XBOX Elite in December of 2008, it started having problems of not always reading game discs two weeks after purchase, the only reason I didn't return it to Microsoft then was because I knew all they would do is just send me a POS refurb. I dealt the with the problem for several months until finally it started freezing and RROD'ing on me; giving me no choice but to return it. Now my most recent Elite is doing the exact same thing in less than three months!What makes things even worse is Microsoft's customer support is absolutely useless. As with many companies that don't care about customer service, their XBOX support is somewhere in India and the customer service reps are hard to understand, clueless, unhelpful, and sometimes even downright rude. When I was returning my 4th or 5th XBOX Pro console earlier this year, the rep didn't even want to process the return because he claimed that my warranty expired. This was despite the fact that I had purchased an extended warranty plan THROUGH MICROSOFT and had the actual print out of the warranty certificate that Microsoft sent me. This idiot even tried to tell me that the warranty I purchased for my XBOX Pro console in November of 2006 was for my XBOX Elite console which was purchased in January of 2008. Not only does it make ZERO sense that I could even purchase a warranty for an Elite console I did not even own at the time, the XBOX Elite console was not even out in 2006! I had to fight with him for over an half hour before I got the supervisor on the phone who agreed to let me send it back provided I included a copy of the warranty certificate. Yet even after all of that the geniuses at Microsoft STILL did not apply my warranty to my console so I had to spend another week straightening that out. With me finally sending a letter to the main corporate office stating that I have an extended warranty and I expect them to honor it.I will admit when working I think the Microsoft XBOX 360 console oflffers the best in terms of overall game play and features, but what good is all of that if the console breaks all the time? I am nearing 32 years old and I have bought tens of thousands of dollars (maybe even more) worth of electronic equipment and only ONCE have I had to return something to the manufacturer due to a malfunction. Yet in under two years of owning the XBOX 360, I am on my eighth one. This is absolutely unacceptable and Microsoft has proven that not only can they NOT make a reliable console, they have also proven that they don't care. Even after Microsoft spends over $1 billion to \"correct\" the numerous problems with the XBOX 360 console, failure rates are still off the charts. Heck, I can't even get one that lasts a year. I have taken every precaution to ensure I am doing all that I can to help the extremely fragile console function properly but NOTHING helps. I don't plug it in to a power strip, I always lay it horizontal. I ensure it has adequate ventilation, but guess what? it still fails. I know for sure that if I dusted off my old 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, or Sony PlayStation (The VERY first one that came out), they would STILL work flawlessly. Yet in two years time, the amount of XBOX 360 consoles I have gone through is MORE than the total amount of gaming consoles I have owned in my entire life!As much as I love playing the multitude of fun games on the XBOX 360, once my warranties have expired and they will no longer \"fix\" the console free of charge, I am done with Microsoft based consoles. If I am unable to fix it myself (which I had to do with the first gen XBOX) then all of my games will be sold or donated. I am not really interested in the PS3 or GameCube, so once my 360 bites the dust for the last time, then its back to PC gaming for me.In any case, I will never spend another DIME on Microsoft's extremely unreliable pieces of junk that they call the XBOX 360 or any future consoles they plan to make. I urge potential buyers to think long and hard before spending this kind of money on the XBOX 360, if you still insist then I suggest a replacement plan AT THE PLACE OF PURCHASE, I don't even recommend getting Microsoft's service contract as the reps don't even know how to handle that correctly.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

A full fledged Fantasy reader by that time, the lackluster and insipid dialogue dragged me far, far away from Capcom's RPG.  But its not to say I was never a fan.  I was.  And, if extrapolations are accurate, BoF V will come out bursting in noble bearing and reestablish my fanhood.  I am though, very fond of the first two BoF games.  Both games, early drafts of the future fabrication of traditional RPGs, had an excuse to have unsavory dialogue of today's gut-wrenching standards.  Anyway, back in the day, BoF was an underrated landmark of RPG greatness.  Vaguely recalling how I lost my copy for the SNES (I think it revolved around a starving kid and one of his favorite RPGs), I felt compelled to revisit the game on the GBA.  Borrowing it from a friend, then stuffing my flabby butt on a warm, cozy couch, reasons why I was so intrigued with BoF slowly seeded and came into palpable emergence.Square originally published the game, hence the word PUBLISH.  They did not get their hands in the grim and take part in the actual production. Capcom did.  In their effort, they shaped something entirely new and unsuspectingly praiseworthy.  Unlike most plot-driven RPGs, an RPG to have a story woven around dragons is enormously sporadic.  Personally embracing a scenario set in the combat of dragons, I found myself coaxed and immersed into a nifty plot.The tale picks up when Ryu, a dragon disguised as a blue-hair human, sets out to envelop vengeance on the wicked Dark Dragon Clan.  Leaving Ryu's home village in ashes, the Dark Dragon Clan then focuses their sights on freeing Tyr, the female apocalypse.  Ryu, ordained by his higher ranks, must prevent this with his personal score to settle.  On his lengthy journey, he enlists the aid of a few comrades, and ultimately helps them resolve their sticky origins.  What struck me most about BoF was the balls Capcom had.  They presented some of the most oddball characters ever made.  Characters like Gobi (a Fish-man), Bo (a Wolf-man), and the Mogu (a Mole-man) wouldn't have been so well received in today's grueling critiques.  Nevertheless, the likable cast is quite a departure to be had.Gameplay-wise, the traditional RPG menu of Fight, Magic, Item, and Defend are faithfully intact.  BoF is  your customary fantasy quest with all the stereotypical dungeons and environments to delve into.  What truly set BoF apart form Traditional RPG counterparts though, is Ryu's ability to morph into a number of mighty dragons.  Each dragon had its magical property, cladding the game in sorts of strategic value.  All throughout the vast lands, Dragon Shines were found.  When Ryu entered one, he and he alone proceeded in a  backbreaking duel with another dragon to gain its type.  Gratifying the challenge appetite, those shrine battles were  particularly unforgiving, but with time and re-evaluating the line of attacks, success reeled in.Outside the shelter of friendly towns, the game is played in a 2D overview and the party usually went to explore dungeons and what not.  Each character had a special skill not directly found in combat but in discovering pathways, those are Ox who demolishes walls and  Mogu who dug passageways underground.  Together with all the trappings of an old-school RPG, BoF has some addictive minigames.Bo is a professional when it came to his use of bow and arrow, and he snapped the bowstring when animals were found moving on screen.  The hides of animals are traded in towns for several items.  But of all the minigames, Ryu's ability to fish was awkwardly addicting.  Nicely executed, BoF on the GBA identically matches the SNES experience.On its presentation, the graphics on the GBA are nearly indistinguishable as the original.  The only exceptions are the upgraded view of vibrancy.  Not flamed with glamour like Golden Sun, BoF is as simple as colorful pixel art.  Hey, with its fluid sprite animation and additions of new face portraits, I have no latent quibble.  The tunes are swell, stuffed in the right moments and keeps a hale and hearty overall feel.  Besides, the discharging world music is godsend, briefly hypnotizing me back into what I haven't played in ages.For the most part, BoF employed and triggered old SNES nostalgia.  Grateful of the GBA port, I propose RPG fans to take a look.  If and only if your expectations are sky-high in a game's design, and if you do have a copy of Breath of Fire with a healthy SNES, I wouldn't go as far as to purchase it, because the enhancements are minimal.  Replete with all the trimmings of a lustrous old-school combination of sorts, BoF is a whipping combination of blueprints on how Traditional RPGs came to be.  Even in a new era of gaming and the lack of fancy-schmancy graphics, I hope never to return this enjoyable cartridge to my pal, because friends are for the taking and this little gem is already lodged along the likes of Golden Sun and portable Zelda greats.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2002"}

This provides some interesting new battlefields set on sun-bleached coral atolls in the Pacific.There are plenty of deafening, large-scale set-piece battles, but there's also variation to change things up but remains a Call of Duty game through and through. What that means is that the action is fast and fluid, as well as rigidly scripted. The success of the franchise proves that there's a vast audience for that, and this won't change anyone's mind.All told, the single-player campaign is about as short as that in Modern Warfare, but it doesn't drag on. Plus, there's considerably more replayability here because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode with up to three other players. World at War builds on the groundbreaking Modern Warfare. There remains the create-a-class and rank system that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and upgrades that you can then mix-and-match to create different load outs.It's easy to be jaded about World War II shooters, but Treyarch makes a convincing argument to stay excited with World at War. The game is packed with a deep amount of gameplay to appeal to every type of player, from those who want to experience a gritty single-player campaign to those who like to play multiplayer. This is a solid, confident shooter with plenty to offer the casual and hardcore alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Craig Moller","summary":"To be or not to be an expanison pack","reviewText":"Halo: ODST was rumoured a small expansion to Halo 3. However, what you get is a six hour campaign which further expands the boundaries than that of Halo 3, a great new mode built on cooperative called Firefight and an entire second disc filled with every single map released for Halo 3's multiplayer.Halo: ODST brings about some changes, there is no Master Chief and there is no sight of the game being played by his rules. This includes no dual wielding, recharging shields and gravity won't feel mocked anymore by Chief's jumping. Instead, you'll take the role of the Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or ODST. These guys don't have all of the strengths of the Chief. They can only aim one weapon at a time. They have a health bar that requires health packs to restore once their light overshield is depleted. They can't jump as high or fall as far or take as many bullets without stumbling into Death's open arms. They handle quite like Master Chief did in Halo: Combat Evolved, and they have a powerful scoped pistol to complete the throwback feel.The ODST may handle like the Halo of yester year but the campaign among other modes is as fresh and exciting as one could hope for. With the Chief sitting this one out, Bungie has gone from its usual Spartan driven romp and has focused on a more character driven, thus creating one of the most satisfying Halo storylines yet in the franchise. The ODST actions take place during the events of Halo 2 (ah, the memories), just as Master Chief is wreaking havoc on the Covenant and forcing the Prophet of Regret to make an emergency slipstream escape.However, the big guns of this army is the the new mode firefight. The action is non-stop with one random wave of Covenant foes coming after another. As you make it further into the match, difficulty modifiers, called skulls, get turned on, dramatically increasing the level of challenge. It's a hell of great time. My match with some mates lasted just under three hours and by the end of it all we restarted for another load of fun. Good times.Halo 3: ODST isn't a true sequel, but it is more than a standard expansion. If you're on the fence about buying it, drop your reservations and go snag a copy. If you love Halo, you owe it to yourself to pick this up as soon as you can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"The Near Perfect Batman Experience","reviewText":"Well, I state that because nothing will ever compare to sitting down and reading a comic book series to anything else. However, in a digital format where you are controlling the Batman, stalking the criminally insane, and being DC's greatest Detective; this is the definite title to experience Batman. When you play this, you have to remember that this is a video game developer's version of the superhero vigilante. Things will be different or altered. The controls were my biggest complaint. Not entirely on how you control him, but just one simple fact that I agree with the hilariously honest review Yatzee from Zero Punctuation. Why is it that you have to hold down a button to make Batman run? Why can't the thumb stick determine if he walks or runs? But that was literally my only complaint about the controls. Fighting a group of baddies using take downs and counters were fun and easy while not being mind numbing difficult to figure out. Moving around Arkham Asylum will take up a good portion of the game. The player will have to use the detective mode many times to figure out where to go or open up for certain areas and even to figure out where the baddies are at. It does make the game easier and feels like you can play all the way through the game with it turned on. Seeing skeletons displays on the bad guys does get old so you will want to turn it off during action sequences. Another minor complaint is I wish they moved the camera back a bit. I was not a fan of Gears of War because of the big bulky main character taking up a huge portion of my game screen. It makes you wonder how he is able to crawl in tight spaces and grapple around while being that bulky.The best part, it really did feel like I was playing a more mature version of the Batman: Animated Series. It was WONDERFUL to have the voice cast that I grew up watching on FOX. And beleive me, it was a blast to have the best Joker back: Mark Hamil. Hearing that familiar insane laughter and actually joking whether sadistic or funny, it's great to have this super villain back the way I remember it. Other super villains do contribute mood of the story. I think the runner up under Joker would be the Scarecrow sequences. I actually enjoyed the mini platforming sections of those.  As I mentioned, the Near Perfect Experience in digital format of the Batman, I do mean it. Batman fans will love the comic book nostalgia that is all over Arkham Asylum.The overall Metroid ish game play was fun. I loved stalking Joker's henchmen and actually seeing them react with fear as I took each one down. I did as much of the collection part while doing the story as much as possible, but I simply could not put this game down till I finished it all the way. I'm currently half way done with the harder difficulty and the game still feels fresh and fun like the first time I played it through, well except a bit harder. It's even enjoyable and challenging on the harder difficulty, but not as much compared to Resident Evil 4's Professional game setting.This game can please the action gamer even if one is not a fan of Batman. The way the game developers created the look, story, and animations contribute to how this game did deserve a Game of the Year edition. By all means, this is not a title to miss. Please play it before Arkham City arrives in October.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2011"}

The game is a little slow to start and the controls and fighting take some time to adjust to but give yourself a half hour and you'll have the hang of it.The plot is a classic super hero vs. super villain scenario. Batman faces off against many of Gotham's most deranged criminals. Fist fights are a lot of fun, pay attention to the counter...if you don't you'll take lots of unnecessary damage. Batman's vast collection of gadgets will assist in traveling through Arkham and uncovering the great number of hidden treasures. Batman's cape is fluid in flight, running or battle.The boss battles aren't revolutionary but they are effective and well done. Croc's Lair was particularly well done. The water looked amazing and reacted realistically to any movement. Each boss presents a unique challenge and great satisfaction when you have defeated them. Take a couple minutes to rest your weary thumb after the Joker battle!The cinematics are among the best of any PS3 game. Endure the credits for a brief teaser at the end.The game's environments and music set a slightly eerie mood for the game. The voice acting is top notch - Batman and Joker are the best.Even after completing the game you can return to the island to find any treasure you may have passed over.Challenge mode presents more playtime if you want to pummel more enemies.

Take a main character, or anti-hero, place them in a bizarre situation in an exotic locale, and load it with tons of special effects. Of course on TV this seldom translates into good ratings because the viewer is rooted in everyday reality which prevents them from really ever fully accepting the premise. Another reviewer used the phrase \"suspension of disbelief\" and I think it's well used on Far Cry. Here's a game that would make a schlocky TV show or movie but for whatever reason crosses over into the medium of computer game and becomes a precious jewel of a game, an icon of how to put such a thing together and become a hit. I begin to wonder if this is the best recipe for computer games, but that's for another post!In Far Cry you play the character of Jack Carver. Jack is a laid back, contract tour guide of sorts in Micronesia. Jack also happens to be an ex-special forces operative, which brings him to the attention of a mysterious lady named Valerie who hires him to take her out to a remote chain of islands. Jack's vessel is destroyed by a surface to ship missile and Jack finds himself unconcious in the remains of an old Japanese WWII fortress. He is soon contacted by an enigmatic researcher named Doyle who guides Jack through a very large portion of the upcoming game. It turns out that Valerie is actually a CIA agent sent to research a scientific madman who's performing macabre experiments on animals and transforming them into something much worse...This plot wouldn't work too well on TV, but here it is absoultely dazzling. CryTek has also managed to give the player a premium selection of weapons and vehicles to complete thier tasks with, and not only that but the game can be completed through several methods. Want to play a stealthy character? There are ways to sneak around enemies with a silenced MP-5 submachine gun. Want to pick of your enemies from a distance? The sniper rifle is your calling. Want to just barrel in and do the whole thing Rambo style? It is *all* here, and this allows a surprising amount of replayability in the game as you can finish it with any number of different styles.CryTek has given Far Cry one of the most impressive graphics engines I have ever seen in a game. Two years after it's release and this game still pushes the envelope for graphical detail. Low crawling through the bushes will cast a series of moving shadows on your weapons. Other islands in the chain can be seen from a *looooong* distance away. Even the underwater life, be it fish or seaweed, are to be seen to be believed. Colorful parrots fly overhead and seagulls glide and hover by cliffs. And if you ever wanted to go to a tropical island but could never afford it, believe me...this is as close to the real thing as you are liable to find on a computer anywhere. It's been over a decade since my last visit and I get a kick out of just driving the boat around the islands and over shoals. The addition of the old WWII Japanese forts idea adds just the right touch. One will run across old Zero fighter planes crashlanded on the island. Remains of coastal artillery and even an old Japanese aircraft carrier can be found and explored largely at the player's whim. It's this kind of attention to detail that really brings this game out.Enemy AI is very, very impressive. Mercenaries will communicate with each other and use cover expertly. They're sneaky too, and will try and flank you constantly while the others keep you pinned down. Trigens, the biological nightmares being bred on the island, will chase you relentlessley, causing you to panic. And for good reason, one swipe from their claws is capable of killing you. I found using the Cry-Vision Goggles is amazingly effective in seeing Trigens before they see you.PROS:-The game has a real \"Island of Dr. Moreau\" feel to it. And it really, really comes across well-Fantastic weapon selection-Superb enemy AI-Vehicles are a blast. Period.-Graphics are top-notch, two years after the game's release. Impressive.-The Micronesian islands feel like real islands. You can get yourself lost in the immersion of the whole thing.-The binoculars and Cry-Vision Goggles are not one-use items like they are in other games. You will use them repeatedly and to good effect.-Hang gliders deserve special mention. What a fantastic execution of a unique idea!-Very good plotCons:-Voice acting is ho-hum, but it can be argued that this adds to the experience-Graphics will tax a lot of computers, although if you have a PC less than a year old it's playable at high detail.-One can only carry 4 weapons at a time. It's more realistic this way but may bother some players.-Some levels are near impossible to finish-No save feature. Auto-saves onlyThis is an excellent game and one in which I cannot recommend enough. It's well worth your time to take a look at this classic. My hat's off to Cry-Tek.

The fact that they couldn't waste time giving you a personality and voice to sympathize with is strike number 1.Following a perfect storm of economic collapse and the over-consumption of the remaining oil supply (hint hint), North Korea, supported by a massive alliance, conquers most of North America. They really should've replaced Kim Jong Un with the face they had in the trailers, as its hard to take a villain seriously when he looks like the kid you used to roll for his lunch money.The generic rail shooter du jour is offset by insanely brutal and visceral side bars where you see acts of monstrosity the Nazi's would've been proud of, and the fact that its the DPRK makes your gorge rise as you know that they're more than capable of such acts, considering they already have a fair portion of their population in concentration camps and gulags.Graphics are top notch, and only facial expressions are a bit weird, but who cares when you'll be looking through gun sights all the time anyway. Environs, skylines, and stage setup are all wonderfully done, and even the sprinkling of cover structures actually start to fad into the background after a while.But overblown action offsets the pacing and feel. There's a wonderfully put together counter point scene where you wander through a base camp, filled with smiling civilians wondering at the next mission you'll embark on. But the other 98% is a non-stop adrenaline overdrive rush, making it impossible to catch your breath against the barrage of gunfire and do some character development. That's strike two.The worst part is the \"we got pushed into making a deadline, so we just slapped together whatever we had on hand\" ending. So many wonderful possibilities existed, including a confrontation with the penultimate Korean officer, but its ham handed with a barely worthwhile semi-boss fight. That's most assuredly strike 3. The saddest part is that all the pieces are there. Interesting, well voiced characters, great weapon setups, and multiple environments. But shoehorning a guerrilla war storyline into a bland, boring shooter vest is what separates this from Freedom Fighters, a great story and setup that struggled solely in the graphics department.Overall, a great setup with absolutely terrible delivery. So much potential sacrificed on the altar of pushing a game before its prime. Storyline is worth a rent, as you can fart through the plot in 5-6 whole hours, and a few days of MP combat will decide whether its right for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2011"}

The Donkey Kong Country series went portable with DK Land, Rayman was a surprise full of perfection, and Vectorman appealed to Sega Genesis players with its colorful pre-rendered graphics that DKC had done. All of these games were great, but Yoshi's Island was the best of all. While Rayman would have been my favorite game of all time, it suffered from the most extreme difficulty EVER. Yoshi's Island has amazing graphics, catchy sound/music, awesome gameplay, AND forgiving difficulty alike.This is not the average Mario game, but rather is it what fans would call a Yoshi game, since it plays a lot differently. As Yoshi, you romp through levels like usual, but now you can throw eggs at enemies, as well as eat enemies to make eggs. There is also a huge variety of obstacles, like boulders, loads of unique platforms, collectible flowers, the enemies doing all kinds of stuff, etc, etc. But the thing is: It is all well-crafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences. Don't believe me? Go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage. One look and you'll agree that it looks beyond terrific.There are also some bonuses in the game to help you on your quest to defeat the evil Bowser Jr. For example, there are small houses that you may possibly find in a level (It requires a key, though). Once you are able to enter in, you must compete with an enemy in a certain challenge (Collect most coins, Pop most balloons, etc). There's also bonus challenges when the goal chooses a flower you had collected (In a roulette-like way).Overall, it's definitely one of the greatest platformers I have ever played.

This is not.","reviewText":"The first arcade version of Crazy Taxi, with its instantly recognizable music and appearance, was an amazingly popular game.  Its concept was simple yet irresistible -- to create a driving game where you don't have to worry about crashes, and where your goal shifts all the time so that it's the equivalent of 30, 40 racing courses.  I was a devotee of this game and had spent hours on it.This PlayStation 2 version lost most of the magic in the translation.  For one thing, inevitably, the controls are just not the same without the steering wheel, pedals, and the all-important gear shift, without which (and without knowing the &quot;boost&quot; move) you could never hope to pick up more than five, six passengers before your time runs out.  The PS2 version, grievously, sped up the game clock so much that the game just blitzes by.  It took me a long time to figure out how fast you have to execute the boost to make it work, and even then, finesse of control flew right out the window.  So the game became what it always threatened to become, a frantic, overly speedy experience fit to give you a heart attack, so fast that there's very little fun factor, just rushing to meet all the times without getting to enjoy anything.So many games these days are about &quot;beating the clock&quot;, probably reflective of our ADD-infested culture.  Street Fighter became another flashy, graphics-ridden button masher; Syphon Filter now forces you to run through levels ignoring enemies just to meet their insane &quot;par times&quot;, and Crazy Taxi requires the reflexes of a cockroach.  Maybe I'm from an older game culture where you don't have to be on speed to compete.  At any rate, this game was a sore disappointment.

It sticks realism and actual fighting technquies without falling into the all out and full-blown fantasy like other fighters such as Soul Calibur(?) and Mortal Kombat do (Which isn't a bad thing but sometimes its best just to stick to reality). Since I've never played the previous three Tekken Games and I have only read backgrounds and summaries for them I can only give you a review on what I know so far.The Graphics in this game is some of the best I've seen, I was blown away the first couple of times when playing this game. The CGI-3D graphics had a glossy look to them and I was almost convinced that it looked totally life-like, but flaws in the graphics kept me from that edge. Its a lot better than what Namco usually has in this particular department. The body models for the characters range from different sizes (naturally), and the faical features for each is mind-boggling. The stages in this video game aren't specatular, far from it, but they have a realistic feel to it, espically the enviroments with water.My favorite Stage is the Arena; the roar of the crowd and the rock music playing the background really gets me going. There are several fighting modes: Practice, Arcade, Survival, Vs and Time attack, Story-mode, Training and as you know and two unlockable ones in which you unlock by playing the Steve-Fox story-mode and the all-new Tekken Force mode.The story modes for most of the characters are full of details and are intruiging with their own CGI cut scenes. However, by the worst story-mode (SPOILER) has to be Lei Wulong's; the plot wasn't bad but afterwards you get nothing but Lei saying \"Freeze!\" or grunting when he's chasing after Nina Williams: Stupido. But all in all this game is pretty solid the fighting is smooth and never feels clunky and the animations for the characters are great as well. One last note, the voice acting for the characters is Okay at best. A majorty of the voice telents (mainly for, Xiao, Jin,  Kazuya, his father, Julia, Nina Williams, and Yoshimitsu) do a great job for their characters, but then there are some voice talents that really don't fit the character and really have no talent when it comes to this profession. The voice actors for Marshal Law and Howrang(?) are laugable and not believable. The music has been said to be horrible, I think it goes quite will with the game and its stages, although it does have its annoying points but its far from horrible.

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"ice grizzly \"Grrrrrr\"","summary":"Bring home the paradise","reviewText":"Yes the game feels like roaming in paradise.

{"product_name":"B002I0HJG8","description":"","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"I take back the 5 Stars I originally gave this game","reviewText":"Tera has been one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had the opportunity to play in this past year. This game had every ounce of potential to be a fantastically great game but it is held back by companies that don't know exactly what they should do with it (En masse) and have almost ruined it completely with empty promises. Because of these sorts of problems the games true potential may never be realized and it has been dying off a lot faster than any MMO ever should. Tera has a fun combat experience to offer (in the same manner of Console Action RPG's) as well as the most beautiful graphics you can imagine but, outside of that Tera brings nothing new to the table. The leveling Journey goes fast and the end of the road offers very little to keep you logged in. There just isn't enough at the end of the rainbow to make you chase it in the first place other than a gear grinding experience.It's a shallow game that doesn't offer any actual depth once you look beyond its beauty. Is it worth playing YES it still is a fun and unique experience but is it worth subscribing too? No, I would have to say that it sadly just isn't. Additional problems of the game do not stop at lack of content but also trickle down to the TERABLE community in the game and on the games forums that also can add to the bitter experience and dis-enjoyment of certain aspects of the game. It's a swish of the magic 8 ball and the future does not seem clear for TERA. There has been no hints or news on part of the developer or publisher to introduce any revolutionary ideas into the game to give players a reason to come back or continue playing, and there isn't enough content here to keep them staying for dinner. Compared to other game releases like need I say it Guild Wars 2 and Perfect World, Tera stands in the mix as new paint on the same old car that still has the same old problems. Cosmetics just is not enough to make it NEW.If you do decide to give Tera a play, I recommend to do so with a group of friends so that you'll be able to enjoy it more as certain leveling areas can be quite empty and trying to arrange a group for a dungeon will also leave you with memories of LFG woe's. Despite the game has only been out for less than 6 months it already is not fond of \"new players\" as current existing players have already began shunning new players from grouping for dungeons and raids. The possibility of being \"kicked\" from a group attempting your first dungeon for the first time is very high. This can be frustrating as end level content depends on having items from these dungeons. So, I implore those looking into the game to find a good guild or group of friends and create one to improve your enjoyment of the game.Overall 3/5 is my final score for this game. It feels unfinished and incomplete with a future that is anybody's guess. It's not a bad game by any means but just in the wrong hands and that is holding it back more than anything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2012"}

So in Halo Reach they cranked up the difficulty, and please note, I'm playing the heroic mode. What does this mean? It means it takes FOREVER to kill any bad guy with shields, and once you do break the shield it takes a little while to actually kill them, and kill them you had better, because their shields regenerate. There's challenge, then there's tedious slog, which is what this turns into real quick. My favorite point was when I had to re-start an mission, which was fun enough to slog through once, but again - No. Basically, I ran through tough shielded baddies one of which had two weapons, a sword and a green cannon (both are one hit kills). I ran to the cannon you are supposed to use to hold off a giant approaching ship, well, you don't kill the two dudes they will wail on you in the cannon chair until you die, or you can drop down and try and kill them with a rifle and low level alien gun - which is neither fun nor possible because it takes so long, the sequence where approaching ship has started and even if you kill the A-holes you're still F'd. I hate any game with a point where, if you screw up then an autosave occurs you have to restart. This game is gorgeous, best in series even, but the difficulty is to wonky; there aren't more enemies, it just takes for ever to kill them. Seriously, you'll almost have a guy dead, then you reload - giving him enough time to recharge his shields and start all over again. I want to love this game, but the difficulty makes it just too tedious.Also I miss the dual wielding of weapons, the bad guys can do it, but the player can't. Even further also, the friendly AI is worthless. If there is a warthog sequence, make ABSOLUTELY SURE none of the friendly AIs join you, they will always jump in the driver seat and do doughnuts.I really wanted to give this a higher rating, but due to the difficulty, well a better word would be tediousness of it, I'm being pretty kind with 3 stars. I might not even finish it, its that annoying.Don't get me wrong, I love tough games, I'm also playing Dark Souls and love it, but like I said, there's challenge, and there's tedious slog, and sadly Halo: Reach is the later.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2012"}

This is by far the best game of hte Metal Gears series that has been offered to us. This is simply a masterpiece. The cinemas are a tad long, which some people may enjoy and some may not. It definitely adds to the cinematic touch of the game. The graphics of the game are just simply unbelievable. I did notice a touch of framerate slowdown near the beginning when you enter the first swamp, and the trees may have been more than the system could have handled.As far as the storyline, this is classic Kojima at work. This game really draws you into and keeps you into the action at all times. MGS2 weas a letdown for me. I bought my PS2 strictly for MGS2, and was dissappointed with having snake to play as only half of the game. You handle Snake this time around 100% of the game.The plot is pure genius, and will have the famous Kojima quirks through out. The sheer number of animals in this game is incredible all to itself. It seemed like with every new level, more and mroe animals were brought out.For fans of the first MGS game, this new game has a level entitled \"Snakes Nightmare\" which, to me, simply outdoes the Psycho Mantis level of the first. When you first meet \"The Sorrow\", that is simply incredible, and probably as scary as any Silent Hill game..LOL..One note, when you are viewing a cinematic, and you notice the \"R1\" button come up in the left hand side of the screen, press it and look around. There will be times when you will see something that pertains to advancing in the game. Buy this game, you will not regret it.

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Impressive Piece of Hardware","reviewText":"When the Nintendo DS was announced, I didn't think much of the touchscreen.  I even waited until the release of the DS Lite before I jumped on that bandwagon.  Even now, I never use the touch screen on it.  When the PlayStation Vita was announced, I had a different mindset.  Touchscreen technology seems to have improved immensely since it was introduced in cellphones and tablets.  Sony also had me very curious about the touch-sensitive back panel (and VERY happy that this system had 2 analog control sticks!)  I was also rather impressed by the hardware specs...  This little machine is a BEAST!  Over all, I am really happy with my purchase, and I'll be happy to fill in the details why.  There are also a few gripes (nothing worth docking a star, but worth mentioning,) that I have as well.At any rate, I finally picked one up, and have had a few days to mess with it.  The set-up was fairly intuitive, and I had to deal with an update, but that took about 5 minutes to download and install, so no harm there!  I avoided buying any games at the store.  I decided that I'll stick mainly with the PSN for purchasing my games, and with that in mind, I went with the moderately sized 8GB memory card, in hopes that the prices of those come down by the time it fills up.  The first 2 games that I picked up for the PS Vita were Touch My Katamari and Super Stardust.  I was a fan of the previous installments of these games, both were relatively cheap, and seemed like they'd make decent use of the new interfaces (which they did!)  The graphics and sound pumped out on this thing really are top notch.  The controls work perfectly, and having the second analog stick really is necessary for most modern games.  Some reviewers mention that the analog sticks are way too sensitive.  I had absolutely no issues with them.  The buttons are very responsive, and have nice tactile response.  The touchscreen is probably the best I've ever used, and I really like the implementation of the rear touch panel, though I'm still getting used to it.When it comes to some of the more physical features, I'm largely satisfied as well.  Some reviewers mention how big it is, as if they're almost disappointed (though I haven't read any that said that it's so big that it detracts from the experience.)  For me, the size is fine, as I've never been one to take my portables everywhere I go.  In fact, I appreciate the fact that it's larger than the PSP!  You get way more screen real estate! (For the record, I mainly keep them at home, or take them with me when I travel.  I've never been one to cart these to work/school!)  Battery life is sufficiently long, especially considering what's under the hood!  I was actually surprised that the PS Vita lasts so long, and is still pretty light weight.The launch lineup is relatively sparse, but that always seems to be the case with a new console.  I looking forward to a few of the titles that'll be hitting this year:  Silent Hill will have a PS Vita release, and Final Fantasy X will be revamped in HD, and released for the Vita (as well as PS3.)  The system seems to be a hit thus far, so I imagine that developers will be drawn to it, and the list of titles will bulk up soon enough!As I mentioned before, I do have a few nitpicks.  Since I'm used to Sony, I expected these, and I'm willing to deal with them, but these are some issues I'd like to see changed:*No internal storage, and VERY expensive proprietary (Sony Brand-only) memory card options is a bit on the absurd side.  It would make sense that this machine should have enough memory internally to at least handle software updates, game saves and apps that you'd always want access to, like Netflix (this app does have a decent interface, by the way, and while a bit on the small side for long viewing stints, the picture is nice!)  Flash-based memory isn't that expensive, and something like 4GB wouldn't cost them much to install, nor would it take up much room inside.  I get why Sony is trying to lock their cards, but damn...  they're a bit harsh on the wallet!  If there was a rating for \"Affordability,\" the system would definitely lose a star.  But this doesn't affect the over-all quality, nor does it make the games any less fun, so I will stay at 5 stars.*While I like the rear touch panel, it does get in my way at times.  I tend to hold my handheld systems with my fingers stretched across the back of the unit.  I find black holes popping up randomly in Super Stardust, and my Katamari seems to get stretched out randomly.  I'm sure that I'll get used to it, but for now, it's a minor annoyance.*The lack of PlayStation Classics support upon launch is a bummer, but Sony says that they'll add that in once it's ready.Ultimately, I'm very pleased with my purchase!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2012"}

I was a huge fan of all of Sony's past consoles but I came into this generation with the idea if what MS did was better I'd switch. Well, after E3 I knew I was still going to stick with Sony. (I owned both an Xbox and 360 but never cared much for them.)Does it deliver on all of its promises?Well, yes and no.The important thing is it seems to be on the right track and with future updates it will far surpass PS3.I'll update this review as I get to know my new system, but so far I have to give it five stars for what it does do.Remote Play:Works great on same network but haven't had luck at my friend's house when the PS4 is at my house. It is true though that his internet was having problems when I tried. From what I have played through remote play I am very impressed.UI:I'm still getting familiar with it. Things that bugged me at first make sense to me now. Others I'm still figuring out. What I can say is it's slick and almost perfect. It's the evolution of the XMB and is so much faster and more responsive!Controller:I don't care what anyone says, this thing is way more comfortable than Dual-shock 3 or the 360 controller (which I personally found uncomfortable, awkward and a battery hog to boot. Though I did like how solid it was!) It's much more solid than the DS3 and is perfectly balanced.

To the re-sale shop or friends went all of my old SNES games. I began playing mostly RPG or RTS titles on the PC. I had loads of fun with those games, but there were still times I just wanted to play a straight-up PvP fighting game like my old Street Fighter games. Fast forward 15 years and, having purchased an Xbox 360 for my son for Christmas, I made sure to also pick up one of my favorite fighting titles, ever - the latest, greatest version of Street Fighter. While the graphics have been upgraded significantly, all the fun I remember is still there from years ago. With so many new and unfamiliar characters to play with and familiarize myself with, it was almost like playing a whole new game. Best of all, my 10-year-old son has really enjoyed playing it with me. Aside from one particular character's costume (Cammy), the game is very kids friendly and I have no qualms about him playing it and having fun right alongside of me. After so many years gone by not playing this game, this was really fun to be back at it again. This game didn't disappoint in the least, and I look forward to a new year full of street-fighting goodness! Sweet!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"A terrific blend of action and stealth...","reviewText":"Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow is my first real time stealth experience in gaming. And the experience is truly satisfying. Ubisoft has maintained its high game quality over the years and Pandora Tomorrow is no less than a remarkable achievement. If you are new to this sort of gameplay like I am, then read on...You start out as Sam Fisher, an uber elite hi-tech soldier cum spy, working for a top secret organization called Third Echelon. Within that, you are a secret entity known by the code Splinter Cell. Together with a few covert allies, you infiltrate, search, gather intelligence and if need be, 'dispose' off your enemies who could adversely affect the United States. In short, you are one silent bad-ass....The story is fairly coherent in concept but disjoint in terms of character-building. You are after a shadowy Indonesian guerilla group headed by an enigmatic terrorist called Suhadi Sadono. Your task is to find out what he is intentions are and how his actions it could impact the free world. And if his plans bear fruit, you actions would proceed accordingly from infiltrating to liquidating and protecting some vital 'assets'.It is not so much the story as the gameplay that keeps the game moving forward. Splinter Cell falls neither into pure action genre games like Serious Sam or Quake, nor does it fall into the RPG genre like Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights. It lies somewhere in-between. If you have played No One Lives Forever, where you are required to be stealthy in certain levels, then think of Splinter Cell as a game encompassing all the characterisitcs of those levels, but with greater attention to detail and flexibility. What you get is a magnifcent blend of pure action ,subtlety and tension. Absolute, rivetting tension.Graphics, Gameplay & SoundAt almost every stage you are required to perform actions by being in the shadows. Darkness is your best friend. And to help you acheive your objectives, Splinter Cell has the most advanced lighting system in any game to date.  You have a visibility meter which indicates just how much you are exposed to light and if you are careless enough, you would attract unwanted folks to your presence. The secret to Splinter Cell looking so good is that  the shadow lighting effects are all real time and every object casts its won image on other objects in the environment. And any change in the environment will invariably change the objects of that environment. For instance Sam would alert his foe to his presence if he say, blew off a lamp. The guard would patrol the area for sometime and then resume his duty. If Sam does the same thing over and over, the guard could eventually sound the alarm because too many lamps are were blown off for no reason. Hence the true tension comes when Sam has to understand and make use of his surroundings. The graphics is magnificent, showcasing the real power of the Unreal engine that drives it. Sam himself looks great and has different costumes to suit different locales.  All look really cool with the all black costume looking especially awesome. But the best part of the game is when Sam stomps onto bushes in the dense foliage, they make way for him and then spring back and sway about just like in real life. That effect is worth every penny I put into buying this game. It is brilliant, to say the least.The gameplay has a cinematic feel to it.Really.  Sam is utterly believable in action and his movements are jaw-dropping. He can run, stroll, roll, jump, flank or sneak upon an enemy with a cat like grace that is unseen in other games. And add to that, the various sounds of the game are executed with extreme care. All lush locales have ambient natural sounds while the indoors have that clautrophobic roomy atmosphere. Very authentic.The game does not have a replay value though, but you'd love to handle Sam once in a while to re-live the tense moments. But put your efforts into the multiplayer mode which is superb in concept and has the same characteristics that made the single player so enriching.Some cons: Since Sam moves around from region to region, you'd expect his foes to speak native language. It ain't so, and that takes away a lot of authenticity. Also your enemy is rather blocky and less detailed than you. The story is a bit dull in the middle. The game could be really frustrating at times owing to the limited save option in the XBOX.Overall:Barring aside the cons that shouldn't stop you from enjoying Splinter Cell, I suggest you buy this game. It should be in your collection of game classics. On an XBOX, Splinter Cell looks fantastic, achieving photo-realistic levels. Add to that, you are part of a community that has pushed the stealth franchise to a new standard of gameplay. Splinter Cell: PT isn't ground breaking per se, but it takes in all the vital elements that makes this genre so good and adds unmatched lustre to it. Enjoy","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2004"}

David Swan","summary":"The King of Side-Scrolling is back","reviewText":"In the beginning Nintendo created Mario, and he was good. So good in fact that he's often credited with saving video gaming in the mid 80's. Mario wrote the book on side scrolling platformers but after years of ruling the roost decided to move on to the realm of 3D leaving others to carry on the tradition. Some pretenders to the throne were good and some not so good but in the back of our collective minds we all knew that Elvis had left the building. Well, the King is back and it's as if he never even left.The oddly named \"New\" Super Mario Bros launches players' right into the action. After a short 10 second cut scene of the princess being kidnapped (AGAIN) `World 1-1' is ready to go and it feels so right after 15 years of waiting.  There are Goomba's and Koopa Troopa's, toadstools and green pipes, swimming levels and fire plants and coins galore. To all those people who think that the graphics are only a slight improvement on Mario's previous side scrolling adventures I would urge them to pop Mario 2 or 3 into the DS and be amazed at the difference. The new adventure is much more vibrant, colorful and organic with toadstools that dance and sway and water graphics that are absolutely stunning. Mario has some new snazzy moves including the ability to bounce of walls and my favorite, the [...] stomp. Instead of smashing bricks from the bottom Mario can now drop from above and in the case of multi-coin bricks Mario can smack down on it and coins just pour out. Both of these are awesome additions that open up all new playing potential.I have a few slight issues with the game. First, the side to side movement doesn't seem as tight as I remember from previous Mario games. Mario doesn't stop on a dime anymore, he kind of slides to a stop as if the levels were coated in a thin layer of ice. I suppose this is more realistic but it gave the game sort of a loose, floaty feel until I got used to it. The other issue I have is with saving. Rather than saving after every level you save intermittently when you cash in coins or finish a tower or castle. I'm not sure why they made this change but it seems like a rather poor decision on a system that's intended to be played in potentially short bursts.Despite a couple of griping points NSMB may well be the greatest side scroller ever and a welcome addition to the Mario legacy. I can't tell you how much joy it brought me to play a new side scrolling Mario game and this has definitely been one of the toughest games on the DS to peel myself away from. Go get it and relive the glory years of Mario with an all new adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2006"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"One of my favorite games","reviewText":"BRIEFLYI liked the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm for its:- great graphics- easy controls when in battle mode- big story- minigamesThe only negatives I can think of is the somewhat long loading times and the lack of an online mode.THE STORY MODEThe game follows the Naruto arc up to the point when Naruto battles Sasuka at the Final Valley but there are many other on the side.You travel the Hidden Leaf Village collecting ryo and secret scrolls and other useful items while doing various missions. You get ryo by traveling the village, and smashing pots and paper lamps, or as rewards after completing a mission. You use ryo to buy items. If you find secret scrolls - and sometimes you will be using your mind powers or detective skills to find them, sometimes you just notice them - you can exchange them to get new jutsu (powers) for your characters.After you complete missions, sometimes treasure chests appear in the village. These chests can hold some extra ryo, or new jutsu. There are also ingredient bags that are similar to treasure chests but hold ingredients. You can use the ingredient or certain items earned in missions to make ramen and increase your chakra (power).In missions, you do things like complete a mini game, fight in battles or get items to a character. When you complete a mission you can get ryo, items, or characters. Certain missions cause for secret scrolls or chests to appear in the village.The battles in the game make the player control the character easily and make the battle look epic at the same time. You can play as almost any character in the Naruto series. While in battle you can invoke support characters. Every character has their pros and cons, but learning a character's strengths and weakness can make you unbeatable. I foundNaruto Ultimate Ninja Storm: Prima Official Game Guide (Prima Official Game Guides)to be the perfect reference and guide for the game. Each character also has an awaking mode which is a more powerful version of them that can be accessed when they are week during a battle.Not every mission is a battle. There are 5 alternate types of missions:- chase - race against time or another character- climb - like chase, only going up a giant tree- find - giant games of hide and seek- giant battles - fight some giant creature, dodge its attacks and seize the opportunity to attack- count missions - must perform a specific set of actions to complete the missionFREE BATTLE MODEIn the free battle mode you can select your costume, the field and the game will keep track of your score and rank you over many rounds. You can play against a human or AI opponent.You have the ability to pick any character and support characters. You can only do battles in this mode, no missions. If you (player 1) beat your opponent, be it AI or human, you get ranked and you earn some more ryo. However, the second player doesn't earn anything.ENHANCEMENTSThe PSN store has additional support characters that come with their own missions and figures. Up until now, they are all free.MY RATINGI enjoyed the game and I hope you will too. I am giving it 5 stars._______________________________________Note:This was mainly my teen son's review.

True, the story and music are arguably not as refined as previous FFs and other epic RPGs like \"Knights of the Old Republic\". Also, I agree that this title doesn't have that \"Fantasy\" feel anymore and feels more \"realistic\". However, the combat & leveling-up processes are superior to other RPGs, at least the ones I  played. This quality makes the game real fun to play.For some folks, the biggest drawback in turned-based RPGs are the endless time-consuming randomized battles that must be completed to level up your characters enough to fight bosses and complete major story-line missions effectively. Though you still have to battle a great deal of \"randomized\" baddies to level up your characters, in most cases, the end user is in total control of what they choose to fight and when as well as disposing of said enemies quickly.The new combat system that Final Fantasy XII employs is not really a new gaming idea. I have never played an MMORPG, but Knights of the Old Republic for XBOX uses the same semi-real-time combat system. FFXII takes that to the next level by allowing the end user to design a highly detailed and situational \"script\" / \"algorithm\" for characters to follow in battle (the Gambit system). With all of this said, the end user still has the ability to bypass \"the script\" at any point in combat to control the actions of each character.In addition, the leveling up process, though admittedly a little hard to comprehend at first, is simply awesome once you get used to it. The end user has the ability to make each of their characters as flexible as they wish and not follow a semi-predetermined skillset destiny like in FFX.The cut scene graphics are spectacular. However, the in-game graphics are certainly not going to wow anyone like Metal Gear Solid 3 or Ninja Gaiden did. However, the graphics are better than any other RPG on PS2 and the 3D camera is a big plus. Also, the one understated quality about FFXII is the good voice-acting, a rarity in Japanese video games when translated to English.In closing, I highly recommend this amazing epic production and I am sure most people will enjoy playing the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2006"}

I recommend installing all discs to the hard drive because it seems to speed up boot times in between entering the mission areas.  Overall, RAGE reminds me a lot of an old-school Sierra On-Line computer game in that you spend a majority of the time visiting the townsfolk in order to complete missions.  If you're not into exploring towns and dune-buggy racing in between missions, you're probably not going to like this game.As far as gameplay goes, the enemy bandit AI is extremely fierce.  Bandit enemies often jump and twirl at you with a pair of blades.  If you don't have your trusty shotgun handy to blast them away quickly, you're probably going to perish.  This is, afterall, and iD shooter and life without a shotgun wouldn't be complete so SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN!  However, there does come a time later in the game during one of the more enjoyable levels called \"Gearhead Vault,\" where cooking your grenades proves quite useful at dispatching batches of enemies waiting to poach you out of hiding.  If you don't cook them, the grenade is wasted because the enemy AI is too intelligent to just sit there awaiting the grenade to explode.Graphically, this game looks pretty nice.  idTECH 5 is the new graphics engine that powers this game and you can see the polish as all the textures and animations look pretty crisp.  It's interesting how the game transitions from a vast open landscape of canyons and outposts to a more linear arena once you get out of your buggy and set out on foot once the FPS missions begin.  I'm not really sure to the point in all the racing except to show how big a world was created for this game.  The racing itself isn't really all that fun.  However, it seems you have to complete missions pretty much in order and can't go about visiting bandit outposts on your own.  Someone correct me here if I am wrong.Many reviewers griped about the story being the game's weak point.  I didn't mind not having depth to the characters or plot itself.  When you're playing a video game, you care predominantly about gameplay mechanics and graphics paired to the level design.  Overall, this game succeeds to that end saving the player from elaborate cut scenes like you'd experience with the Gears of War trilogy.  For the most part, if you want to go see a animated movie, go see the movie instead of playing the game.  There are a lot of little treats to be had in this game from engineering remote control RC Bomb cars from the 3rd person to utilizing bandages to restore health and engineering lock grinders to open doors.  This really added to the overall package of the game.  In addition, unlike Gears of War 3 and most other video games of today, this game comes with a decent size manual explaining everything which really adds to the game's value.Finally, I'm not quite sure I'd label this game as a first-person shooter because it has some hybrid role-playing elements in that you can collect gear and sell it for cash at the outposts or as I stated previously, use items to construct tools that help you in the levels.  I actually haven't finished this game yet so I won't comment on the ending.  I've heard it comes abruptly lacking a climactic battle found in so many other games.  There are bosses in this game but they are few and far between and often don't bookend the levels.  There are three main outposts to visit and each has it's own theme and utility.  I often found myself going back to where I started in Hagar Territory for my ammo and lock grinding needs and I recommend that most people \"stock up\" frequently as the game seems to get progressively more difficult.  Also, don't forget that you can call a tow using your trusty radio if you get stuck in the wasteland needing a buggy repair.  The game does a good job giving you useful tips during the load screens.In conclusion, buy this game if you are bored and want something to occupy your time before some of the big releases of the season come out like Call of Duty:  Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3.  It's a decent game that's worth a look as the graphics engine does a good job at rendering your environment.  Moreso than that, it offers something off of the beaten path that most fatigued first person shooter fans might enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

The smile that doesn't go away, the exhilaration, and the feeling of having your stomach turned upside down? That's what this game does to you. Burnout 3: Takedown can be summed up in 3 simple words: Buy this game!I'm not a huge fan of driving/racing simulators, where the goal is to cross the finish line in first place, and that's it. Call me morbid, but I love nitrous, broken windshields, exploding gas tanks, and parts flying. Put Gran Turismo, Twisted Metal and F-Zero in a blender, and you get Burnout 3: Takedown. Yes, it is a racing game, however, the goal isn't to just come in first place. Performing \"takedowns\" of other vehicles is a key ingredient. Bumping and crashing your opponents into walls and guard rails (among other things) and causing their utter destruction not only propels you past them in rank, but earns you boost (nitro) power which is a necessity. In addition, the more opposing cars you takedown, the more points and takedowns you earn to unlock new cars and new tracks. You also earn boost power by driving into oncoming traffic and near misses with non-racing vehicles. The goal is to try and get gold medals in each course or mission. That being said, the other cars can take you down as well, and cause you to lose the race if you fall too far behind.It doesn't stop there. There are more than just races. There is Crash mode, which in a way, is a puzzle of sorts. You get a designated vehicle, and the goal is to create as much chaos and destruction as you possible can. Meet the dollar amount in damage designated to get a gold medal, and again, the more cars and tracks you unlock.Another cool feature in this game is called \"aftertouch\". If you do crash, hold down the aftertouch button, and everything goes slow-mo. Now you can actually steer your vehicle in mid-air and crash into opposing racers, and get 'aftertouch' crashes. This way, you lose none of your boost power, and causes damage to opposing racers.You race in 3 different countries: The USA, Europe, and Far East. Each country has picturesque scenery and the graphics of not just the cars, but the tracks and backdrops themselves are nothing short of incredible. EA Games really outdid themselves here. The sense of speed has never been duplicated in any other video game. There are so many different vehicles to choose from and unlock, as well as missions I don't have time to mention.

From the opening interactive cinematic that has you as Batman ecsorting the Joker back into the bowels of the namesake asylum, to the final ( & somewhat) anti-climatic batlle with ol' Ruby Lips himself, this is a ride worth taking. Not since MGS4 has a game pulled you into it's storyline with great voice acting & dialogue that is this crisp, engaging, & in the case of the Joker, very funny.I won't go into story plot points, there will be enough of that on the net in short order. I am going to focus on the gameplay mechanics and other factors that make you want to keep playing \"For just a few more minutes.\" You'll find yourself saying that often. First the movement of Batman & all other characters onscreen is very natural. Imagine if the pages of a classic Batman comic came to life. This is how those characters would move & act. It's that convincing. From the way Batman's cape flows & trails behind him while walking, jumping, running, or during some well choreographed fisticuffs, you'll get the sense you are the Dark Knight. As for the colorful & rather intelligent AI enemies that are the cannon fodder for you, they give you a sense of what it must be like to be a 'Real Badass' & then everything around you starts going wrong. Your buddies begin to get knocked out one by one, or hung from a gargoyle in the hallway, & you suddenly realize that your not the hunter but the hunted. This one of the more shining moments in the game. Batman can easily best 5-6 enemies at a time in the game with some simple combat controls that translate to an ass whooping on screen. You will find yourself feeling sorry for these guys. Especially when they begin to panic & shoot blindly around corners while the Joker taunts them on the PA system & moniters. This clearly demostartes what has always been the most glaring flaw with Batman games since the earliest efforts on the NES. Batman was always a weakling compared to the most rudimentory bad guy. Boss battles were always hit or miss in those games also. I mean do you really believe that Penguin could beat batman in a fight? Of course not & this game doesn't present that scenario. What does happen in the boss fights is the creative manner that you have to approach them & figure out the startegy to win. Again no spoilers here but there are some unique moments. One glaring omission is some of the more iconic Batman foes make an appearance, but you don't get to take them on. But a minor gripe such as this shouldn't deter you from playing this game.As for graphics & sound effects & soundtrack etc., this is the Unreal engine underneath so you can expect good things. It's comparable to any recent game released for it's visual flair & presentation. The dialogue & voice acting is spot as mentioned earlier. Just keep saying to yourself if i saw a Batman comic come to life it would look like this. You'll have a good time.The game is not that difficult which reflects the current trend in the biz toward earier games. I finished it on normal difficulty in just one day. But I enjoyed the ride from beginning to end. There is also enough extra modes & bonus content to keep you busy for good while after you've grown bored with the story. From online to challenge rooms & extra unlockables, this is a treasure trove of Batman goodness.If you are a fan of Batman in comics or movies, buy this & have a blast. If you just want a good action romp then maybe a rental is for you. Either way the folks at Rocksteady & Eidos deserve much credit for doing what has never been done before. They actually made a believable Batman game that is fun to play & will make you want more at the end!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Dr. Freeman","summary":"Just As Promised","reviewText":"This is what FPS games are supposed to be.

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Jon Mcfly","summary":"Fun","reviewText":"It's just is a great deal.

It's the newest, most polished installment of the series and so far I have been personally very happy with it.  If you were a fan of the others, you'll be a fan of this one, it's that simple and there is no reason to write out a full review when Gamerankings.com has detailed critic reviews that can say so much more about the gameplay.Instead I'll focus on the PC version and give 2 tidbits of information that many might find interesting or useful when considering this purchase.1. This game runs great.  My video card is 3 years old, my processor is just as old, I'm running 4gb of memory and my computer runs Rage at about medium settings at best.  I started running Skyrim, it set everything to high, I was running the game at 1440x900 and there wasn't a sliver of lag, even as the initial scenes took place (which are incredible by the way) the game maintained a perfect frame rate and continuously looked fantastic. Bethesda has had some bad rep in the past for releasing games that aren't too polished or very buggy, Skyrim is definitely an exception.  It only takes up 1 DVD worth of data yet looks incredible and runs light enough to have a virus scan running in the background without effecting performance.  They're not gonna release a demo any time soon, but if you're worried about buying Skyrim cause of your system, just consider that if your system can handle most new games Skyrim should run beautifully on your system, it's not pushing anything beyond technology that has been out for a few months.2. The game isn't built for the PC market.  I say this with a bit of sadness because I've always played Bethesda games on PC.  The menus, specifically, have been simplified to be used with a standard controller.  They're difficult and awkward to use with the mouse and keyboard.  This is unfortunate.  You definitely can use the keyboard to navigate menus but since I haven't played a game that required that since.. I don't know, Quake 2, it's a bit disappointing that I can't just click on everything. But, with that said, pop a 360 controller into a USB slot and Skyrim will do the rest for you.  Probably, for an optimal gaming experience you may want to just use a controller.  I, personally, will stick with the mouse and keyboard since I feel things like Archery and whatnot feel more natural that way while only the menu feels a little weird once you get used to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

As you probably know by now Burnout ain`t unlike any other racer,you have to make takedowns wich means taking down the other cars around you by doing that you will get nitro or boost that will make you go faster.That is the essense of Burnout but its a fast high impact destruction and crashing game that everyone should love instantly.If you don`t like racing games,its just fine as I ain`t a fan of racers myself,this is all about killing every one and getting a good laugh about it.Burnout is really a multiplayer game as its just way more fun playing with friends in all the types of races the game has to offer wich is a lot!There are races,crashes objectives,road rage,world crash tour and just so much,i don`t remember all but I can assure you there lots of different things that you can do and a great variety of races types.The XBOX achievements are incredibly tough to get in this game!Most of them are to be done online and are things like win 50 races in a row,really hard things.I think the publisher made them a little too hard to achieve!The ones in the game will take some effort too as none of those achievements comes easy. Also there are a lot of unlockables as there is more than 79 unlockable cars,a bunch of trophies,levels,maps and the achievements are also really tought to get.Along with the online play this game will keep you entertained for a long time as there is just so much to do!On that department its very good,it has great replay value.Even if this addition to the Burnout series doesn`t have much new things it still has better graphics and a great online play on the XBOX 360.Online the game allows you to download videos and make videos also and challenge opponents to be the best on the XBOX Live board.In overral online is pretty solid and worthy of playing. The next Burnout game is coming around 2008 and will be a revolution in the world of Burnout,for now you can still enjoy this excellent game that is Burnout Revenge.Nothing bad about the game except that it starts to get old after 5 games but still a great Burnout game that will keep you playing for a good while.Recommended to Burnout fans,4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2008"}

Never holding back on the damage those iconic claws would cause. Where other games give you a small tease of this power, wolverines Revenge takes this to another level!! You slash and cut through you'r enemies with all the rage expected and gore needed to really feel like Wolverine!! The damage system is just as impressive, I never tired of ripping enemies to literal shreds while I too was literally ripped to shreds!! At one point I was so severely damaged I was a bloody gory skeleton, seriously a skeleton covered in blood attacking enemies!! Something out of a nightmare!! Then watching my muscles and skin grow back in real time just icing on the cake!! All of this was very cool indeed!!Unfortunately that is about it thats offered. The opening of the game is one of the coolest ( if not the coolest) parts of the game. It is bloody and almost overkill, freaking loved it!! But after this phenomenal opening scene you'r left with shallow lame voice acting and drab graphics that look less than impressive. You can tell alot of care was put into the opening at the sacrifice of the rest.Combat starts off fine but quickly becomes repetitive. After fighting wave after wave of enemies slashing, slashing, slashing and slashing it loses it's appeal. You spend most of you'r time button-mashing and thou there are some combos and \"fury\" moves to use they don't offer anything for incentive when you'r regular attacks are just as, or even more powerful. The story is all over the place and useing the same areas over and over again is what really frustrated me. After going back to the same bland and dull environment for the forth or fifth time it begins to drag on. Which is another fault, the story is less then gripping but it seems to have been stretched out for filler, I would have preferred they keep it shorter then drag it put to the point it feels just plain boring. And that kinda sums it up, it gets boring and very boring at that.I really appreciate the attention and passion put into this character finally we can tear through enemies and obstacles as only Wolverine can!! The character is done masterfully and I thank Raven for finally doing Logan the justice he desrves! And for not shying away from the Mature rating a hero like Wolverine needs!!  If more attention and story was offered here, this could have been a masterpiece! But in the end it is a good effort that falls. I'd recommend a rent or if you'r a fan maybe a buy, but I would recommend in either case a test drive first.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country top the lists as Nintendo's best games ever made, but there are other great games too. There are great RPG games (including Final Fantasy III and The Legend of Zelda), great adventure games (Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario All-Stars, the Donkey Kong series, and Earthbound), great racing titles (Super Mario Kart and F-Zero) and great fighting games (Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter).If you own a SNES or are interested in getting one, you should get some of the games I listed above, which are some of the best SNES games of all time, but there are hundreds of other games available.The SNES has provided years of fun and entertainment for me and has never let me down.

Bakehorn","summary":"Madden 07: Nailed deep in the backfield.","reviewText":"In November 2005, I ended my review of Madden NFL 2006 for the Xbox 360 by saying, \"Hopefully next season EA Sports can throw in some of the gameplay modes that made Madden so different while improving on a few of the annoyances.\" Now, nine months later, I'm sitting in my gamer chair rocking back and forth with those new gameplay modes I wanted, but all of the same annoyances and a few more that ultimately make the sophomore next-gen Madden experience a very sour one indeed.Madden NFL 2007 for the Xbox 360 returns with beautiful graphics and attention to detail that made last year's game look and sound nice. The graphics have even been improved, the menus look sharper, there are flashy introductions to each game, and the animations look better than ever. There are some truly brutal tackles in this game. The field deformation looks fantastic and shows the realistic wear and tear on grass fields. The radio announcer is back again this year, as well as the increased amount of on-field chatter and far more realistic reactions from the crowd and stadium announcer. And once again, John Madden got a sock in his mouth As a guy who simply can't stand hearing meaningless, obvious banter, I'm very happy to not hear this man's chatter for another season. The soundtrack is pretty alright, with some of my personal favorite bands (AFI, Audioslave, Rise Against) being on the lineup. All of these things are the best things about Madden NFL 2007, which is why I wanted to get them out of the way. Now, let me proceed to tell you why you shouldn't be buying this game on the Xbox 360.Last year, current-gen Madden players were treated to a new mode called Superstar Mode. Superstar Mode was very similar to NCAA Football 2006's Race for the Heisman Mode-players would create a character and take him all the way through an NFL career in hopes of making him a superstar and a future Hall of Famer. This mode was great in Madden NFL 2006, because you had all the same control over your team, albeit with an obligation to get the ball to your player (or, on defense, sack the crap out of opposing quarterbacks). This year, Superstar mode has shown its face on the Xbox 360-and I'm not pleased. I'm not please at all. In fact, I'm disgusted. Superstar mode, in my opinion, is the worst thing ever to happen to Madden-or perhaps it's the execution. In this new mode, gamers are stripped of most control over the game. You're thrown right into the shoes of your own created player, seeing the field from only his perspective, and doing only what he's supposed to. If your character is a QB and you don't like the playcall, too bad Make the best pass you can, and good luck getting into the Hall of Fame with all of those sacks and interceptions The new camera angles make it almost impossible to see so much of what is going on on-field. It's really sad, because Superstar mode, if executed more like NCAA Football 2006's Race for the Heisman, could have been the best thing to happen to Madden-not the worst.Franchise mode last year was pretty bare, and it's sadly just as bare this year. I recently found a lot of enjoyment in creating a multiplayer Fantasy Franchise with a few friends in current-gen Madden NFL 2007, and I was very sad to see that once again, this option isn't available in the Xbox 360 version. Franchise is, simply put, a string of seasons with basic administrative options and the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl waiting at the end of each season. The only perk this year is the ability to go into training sessions with three of your players throughout each week of the season. Doing this will let you play some of the skill-based mini-games, as well as raise the statistics of your players if you succeed in meeting the scores in each of the mini-games.As a bonus for when (and I said when, not if) you get bored with Madden NFL 2007, EA Sports included some highlight reels of dozens of NFL Hall of Famers. It's nice to see old players being awesome, and I'd really like to see more highlights like this in future iterations of the game. Sure, these guys are Hall of Famers, but I'd really like to see highlights of current players as well. For instance, seeing clips of cover boy Shaun Alexander's 5 first-half touchdowns a few years ago, that would have been really cool. It would be interesting to see, in future games of Madden, if highlights like this could be added into the actual game alongside commentary to show off the history and background of star players. They do this in real life, and if it's in the game, it's in the game, right?After playing current-gen Madden NFL 2007, it's really hard to enjoy the next-gen version. I start noticing things that are so obviously necessary to the game. For example, there is no Playmaker control in next-gen Madden NFL 2007. There aren't as many hot route options. The play-calling menu, something I didn't mind last year, is abysmal for multiplayer games. Even the new and highly-touted Run to Daylight blocking feature was stripped down for the Xbox 360 version of the game. Most importantly of all, though, Madden NFL 2007 on Xbox 360 just doesn't feel like Madden. It's as stiff as a 40-year-old kicker. It's as chuggy as Peyton Manning's scramble. It doesn't feel quick, smooth, or fluid like Madden is supposed to feel. If Madden is supposed to feel this broken, they should put Limpin' Leftwich on the cover, hobbling to the sidelines.Another thing: if A.I. in football games doesn't improve, I give up. Unless you're constantly playing All-Pro or All-Madden difficulties, you'll encounter some absolutely ridiculous A.I. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but the favor always went to the opposing team. For example, my defensive backs absolutely never knew where the ball was. More than 75% of my swatted passes were done manually. Interceptions are never caught, but batted away. Blocks are oftentimes completely missed by guards and fullbacks. Players get stuck together running routes. They'll run their routes as the football is thrown just over their heads, without ever trying to reach up and grab the ball. Some of the animations for play action passes and bootlegs are so lengthy that a blitz will cut straight through the line and result in an easy sack for the defense. Tackles in next-gen Madden NFL 2007 are so frequently shed that it's almost useless to do anything but abuse the Hit Stick. Alternatively, tackles are too easily shed with the Highlight Stick-a welcome addition to the game, but something that's so easy to use, it's hard not to feel guilty abusing it.The problems don't end there. I encountered so many unexplainable flaws in this game that it's hard for me to believe it was finished completely. Is it a bug, or just a new rule that I haven't heard about, for the game to automatically cut off your control when you're winning in the end of the fourth quarter? Sure, it's unsportsmanlike to run up the score, but I'll be damned if I'll sit and watch the play clock tick down all 35 seconds to be a good sport in a video game. I think it's just a bug, because it happened pretty randomly in my play time. The graphics and frame rate stutter very often, causing frequent but short pauses that break up the fluidity of the game. And the bug to stomp out all bugs-the frequent crashes from Madden NFL 2006-return in 2007. My game crashed five times before I ever actually finished an entire game in Franchise mode. It's hard to enjoy a game when it crashes that often. Something really needs to be done here.I love Madden. I look forward to its release every single year. I had never been so excited to play a Madden game before, and Madden NFL 2007 for the Xbox 360 turned out to be the biggest pigskin disappointment I've ever endured. What could have been the first true fully-featured football classic on the Xbox 360 ends up being nothing more than a game that should get passed up by gamers for its current-gen superiors. The sad thing is, I don't know where EA Tiburon can go with this game. They started from scratch with Madden NFL 2006 on Xbox 360, so my only suggestion now is to do what 2K Sports did with their NBA and NHL franchises: use the same engine as the current-gen games and simply beef up the visuals and presentation. I'd rather have a prettier version of current-gen Madden NFL 2007 than what came out this year for Xbox 360. Madden NFL 2007 looks and sounds wonderful, but if you actually want a fun football experience, look no further than the game of the same name on PlayStation 2 or Xbox. You'll have a much better time for $10 cheaper.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2006"}

Dragon Age features engrossing game play, and plenty of freedom to tailor your experience.  While traveling on quests, the characters often engage in funny conversations.  They really grew on me after awhile.  You can customize so many different things about your character(s), including his/her origin story.  Also, the decisions you make (whether \"good\" or \"evil\") affect the story's plot as well as your team mates' opinion of you.If you liked Baldur's Gate on the PC, you'll definitely enjoy this.  I hated God of War 3 because of the constant button mashing.  Pretty graphics, but off-putting game play on GOW3.  Dragon Age requires strategic thinking as you build (and \"program\") characters, choose side missions and craft supplies.  Yet it's also fairly fast-paced (although you can pause and direct your characters to execute specific tasks if the action gets too crazy).There is a huge amount of game waiting for you in this Ultimate Edition.  It's easily one of the three best games I've played on any console.  I read that you can upload a previous save from this game when you play the sequel, Dragon Age 2.  Your earlier decisions will be acknowledged in the new game.  Very much looking forward to that...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fantastic gameplay","reviewText":"I've been on a Batman kick so I went back to play Batman Arkham City and Arkham Asylum. Both are just as much fun as when they first came out! Here's a fresh review of Arkham City, the second of the two games.Where Arkham Asylum was a fairly contained, \"I-know-what-to-do-next\" kind of game, Arkham City opened up the world and let you really explore. There are main missions as well as side missions, and there's more of a sense that you're really loose in a city trying your best to hold off the mob of nasties. The map is very helpful to keep you organized, and you can even tag trophies that you can see but not get to, to remember to go back and work on them later.The atmospheric graphics are just amazing. The sound, the visuals, the vocals, all meld together to give you a sense of struggling to survive in a world almost beyond redemption. This is definitely not a game for little tykes. It well deserves its Teen rating. For older gamers, this is a fantastic thing. You are delving into an adult world of chaos and despair, and only you can hold it off - if you're lucky.The stealth, fighting, swooping, head-kicking, are all phenomenal. You can feel the staggering power when a fist lands on a skull. Your take-downs feel as if you were a powerful superhero doing what has to be done.Along the way you get your level ups, upgrade your armor and weapons and toys. You have 400 riddles to track down, and in addition to your main batman story there's also a catwoman story. So there are a good range of options for all styles of gamers.If you were addicted to Arkham Asylum, you'll definitely appreciate the larger style of gameplay here and the tweaks to actions and costumes. I do want to caveat again that this is more of an open style approach. If you really enjoy the go-here-then-go-there style of gameplay, you could feel lost. Still, with all the walkthroughs on the web, it's not that you should ever really be stuck. If you *need* a hint about what to do next, it's out there.Well recommended for all action gamers that are teen and above.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Didn't enjoy the game at all","reviewText":"Witcher 2 looks awesome and feels awesome. It's an epic adventure that spans a very detailed world. Little things in the game really put me off from enjoying it that much. I'll explain some things that I liked and what I didn't like:Liked:1) Characters. Some of the characters in the game are simply awesome. I can't really explain in detail of all the characters, but what I can say is that each character has a really good back story to them.2) Locations. You get some really awesome locations in this game. A very detailed world that is similar to what maybe Medieval times in history. Some of the details in the forest areas are really spectacular.3) Crafting. Crafting is awesome. You can collect ingredients and make some very powerful potions that can aid you in battle. I find it fun to collect things and try to make the best potion or weapon. It's easy to read and understanding.4) Uncut Extended edition. The version of this game is what's called the extended edition of the game. PC Gamers get the upgrade for free. Xbox gamers get a very well packed item. You get a guide, and you get all sorts of bonuses and contents that the PC game got. So you lose nothing and gain some things.Of course this is where my likes ended. Of the things above, you'll notice some keys things like combat and story are missing. They're part of my cons and I'll explain them below:1) Combat. Combat has many little things that I dislike which makes it troublesome for me to enjoy the game freely. I believe a game should \"flow\" from one event to another and combat should be something you do while you transition from one event to another. This game takes a different way in battling. For starters, you don't get healing items, which is fine for me because you get some really powerful potions that you can take. Trouble is you have to figure out when you're about to fight and then take on the potion prior to battle (you can't take it during battle). You will buff and in some cases have drastic difference in winning or losing. This cases a lot of \"trial and error\" in that if you get into a battle, you're just going to have to reload and then take potions if you lose. I feel this throws it off as many times I get into a long dialog, get into a fight, then die only having to reload and take potions and redo the entire dialog, then win the fight. It's rather troubling to me to have to skip all that dialog just to get into a fight.Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't epic fights. By the end of the first chapter, I got into one giant epic fight and it was fun if you know how to use signs which bring me to my other problem with the game. The usage of \"signs\" which is in short the ability to use magical properties like stunning, or laying down a trap. This sounds fun but the game relies on it heavily from time to time exploiting a single sign. For example, in the first big boss fight, you can use a sign that stuns or pushes back your enemy which you have to exploit to win the fight. I feel signs are a major distraction towards the game especially if you have to use it to win.Last issue I have with combat is with combat itself. You have no way to heal which is fine if you use potions because it may heal you or buff you enough to where health doesn't matter. The combat itself is rather clunky and unresponsive for me. The game has it where you have two swords type: a silver and a steel sword. Each sword works for a certain type of enemy like silver is for beasts while steel is for human targets. Use the wrong one and you'll find severe penalties. The combat itself is rather clunky for me. You just either get the upper hand by sitting there block then when they attack, just keep pressing the A or X button to do some fast chopping then dodge out. Overall it feels burdensome and on top of that if you buffed yourself before the fight, you don't really have to do much expect run up and chop them silly.2) Dialog. I have never seen a more annoying dialog system than this game. When you enter a room to talk to someone, for no reason the game centers you and the person into the middle of the room. So suppose you talk to someone in a bar, suddenly you're both standing in the middle of the room talking. That is fine but the troubling part is as you craft or purchase items. Let's say you craft an item, and find you need X. So you have to quit the entire dialog, you're in the middle of the room, said person starting to walk back to his previous position, you engage dialog again, buy item, quit, back at center of room, then you have to talk again to select the craft dialog. Very annoying and many times I just quit in frustration of having to talk over and over and having them stand in the middle of the room.Conversations are also rather annoying as anything. Talking with the locals make you wish you can just go on a rampage in the village and save them from their own stupidity. The conversations with women are the worse while conversations with males are even more annoying. It feels like people \"suddenly\" do things in a conversation. It also feels like the same volume of voice is there. In the beginning of the game, you are in front of some people who are about to be executed. What happens is people are yelling but their yelling voice is at the same volume level as their talking voice and it's very slow and spaced out. It sounds as if the voice actors just read a piece of paper but they're not very excited about their job.3) No partners! You get a crew but they do nothing and they randomly appear to come along with you and rarely fight! You are a lone wolf who has to fight an entire army and MAYBE, randomly get help from your friends. Doesn't feel like a grand adventure when it appears you just randomly dialog with your friends, and then randomly get them as partners.Also many times key choices are given in the game but you don't really know who to choose because you rarely had a chance to speak with the person.Overall the combat and dialog really put me off with this game. It feels like an epic adventure that you're not really a part of. The combat and dialog system really turns me off in this game. The infrequent and seemingly random involvement of your friends really put me off because it feels like they're on a grand adventure but you're not part of it or rather they randomly want to be a part of it.Just something about this game. I really want to enjoy it but just can't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

You are Ashley Robbins, a 13 year old girl who has been living with her aunt Jessica for the past 10 years.  Ashley's parents, who were said to be dead, supposedly went to Blood Edward Island but never returned.  Just recently, Ashley received a gift that she believes is from her father.  The gift turned out to be a little device called the DTS which had a message saying for her to meet him (her father) there at Blood Edward Island.  Ashley sets off to Blood Edward Island the day before her 14th birthday with her aunt Jessica.After you get to Blood Edward Island, the real fun and mystery and creepiness begins.  There is creey music, creepy surroundings, a lot of dialog which kind of makes me feel like I'm reading a book, which is a good thing by the way, to balance out all the other games I play.  You will meet a ghost who died 57 years ago when he was a boy, who has completely forgotton why he died and who he is.  D, the ghost, is trying to solve his own mysteries as well.Most of the game is used with the touch screen and it's filled with puzzles and searching for clues.  It's one of those games that you want to play either at night or just when you don't want a whole lot of action.  I personally love it!!  And I haven't even finished it yet.  There are two different endings to get so after I beat it once, I will play it again and probably more times after that.  It's kind of like watching a mystery and reading a mystery book with very little or no actual enemies.  As far as I can tell, there are no enemies but that's what makes this game so intriguing.  You are trying to find out what happened to Ashley's parents, aunt (who also disappeared after arriving at the island) and the ghost.It really is a nice change from the regular games I usually play like Castlevania, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Final Fantasy.  I really believe that there should be more games made like Trace Memory because it's kind of like nothing else ever made and Nintendo has always been like no one else and Trace Memory is another example.  I am a 26 year old female who loves many different kinds of games and if you like creepy and psychological stories without violence, Trace Memory is the best there is!  Way to go Nintendo!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2005"}

It's quite a bit of fun and plays like a weird hybrid of Gears of War mixed with liberal doses of \"I, Robot\" and \"The Terminator\" films. Once you start playing it, you'll really see the similarities between it and Gears of War, due to the similar weapon selection and cover system. The major difference is that you're shooting up robots instead of crazed mutants emerging from craters. One of your sidekicks is a cyborg that looks like he could have stepped right out of \"I, Robot\", a similarity so obvious that it could only have been done on purpose as an homage. The graphics are well done and the music and general sound design are designed equally as good. One of the best aspects of this game was the action, which was pretty intense. The bosses are HUGE and the battles vary from stage to stage, in a pretty surprising number of ways. Your enemies are generally cyborgs and when you shoot them, it's pretty cool how you literally take them apart yet they keep coming at you, dragging themselves towards you intent on taking you out. The voice acting is decent but if there's one thing about this game that I have to say was realized pretty horribly, it's the voice activated commands. You shout orders or say general responses to character dialogue via the headset(sorry, no Kinect connectivity here) and half the time, the headset is picking up other sounds or not recognizing your commands. I found it so frustrating that I simply turned off the option. Trust me, you'll probably want to do the same.I didn't get to try the online portion of the game because no one was online for me to play with, so my apologies on that end. I would totally recommend Binary Domain, especially to people who liked the Gears of War game that it shares so much in common with. It's surprisingly enjoyable, has a decent story and cool characters and is a genuinely fun game that was sadly and mistakenly overlooked for reasons I'm not even sure of.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

ITSELF","reviewText":"Wow! I just finished this game a few minutes ago and my body STILL feels a bit chilled! I have to say that I was really impressed with this game, especially the ending. As for everything else, I'll break those down below:GRAPHICS: 4/5 STARS. I don't value graphics all *that* highly, but the lighting effects (and others), were absolutely wonderful. And I'm not even playing on a fancy computer (it's just a Dell Latitude D620, by no means a gaming machine).SOUND/MUSIC: 4.5/5 STARS. There isn't much real MUSIC in this game, but the sound effects are definitely creepy enough to set the setting. Especially the high-pitched \"Psycho\" type sounds when something really scary happens to you.STORY: 4/5 STARS. To be honest I didn't pay as much attention to the story as I should have (voice mails and laptop audio), but I still got the gist of it all. Guess I'll have to play through it again, but I won't mind that. Basically, if you take Hannibal Lecter and the girl from \"The Ring\" in this video game, add a creepy storyline revolving around the paranormal and a birth gone wrong, this will equal the ingredients for one helluva story. If nothing else, the paranormal aspect of the game is so refreshing after games with plots like, \"experiment gone awry\" and \"kill every Nazi in sight\".I beat the game in about 20 hours, which seemed pretty adequate to me.FRIGHT FACTOR: 4.5/5 STARS: This is where this game truly shines and probably what you'll remember it best for. I remember getting a few chills in Doom 3, but F.E.A.R. had moments where I was CHILLING--especially towards the end. The scariest level by far was \"Alice Wade\" and then the last level.Remember in movies like \"Predator 2\" where guys just shoot in every direction because they don't know what's attacking them? I had more than a few of those moments. Sometimes you'll even find yourself shooting at things you know you can't kill!There is blood in this game, but unlike Doom 3, it is used sparingly and not gratuitously for maximum effect.The fright factor is definitely increased by playing this at night and with the volume turned up, but even in the daytime you might let out a yelp or two.ENEMY AI: 4.5/5 STARS: The second thing I think people will remember this game for is the AI. In the course of the game, I've seen my enemies crouch, roll, run, toss grenades, flank, low-crawl, jump from a higher level to a lower level, shoot around corners (exposing very little of their body), and call reinforcements. These guys don't play around! But it makes for some great firefights and I'm just dying to play again on a harder difficulty to see if I can still waste them.WEAPONS: 4/5 STARS: Pretty much standard FPS fare. You have your hand guns, your machine guns and shotguns, then finally your weapons of mass destruction. But what was really impressive was what these weapons do to your enemies! When you shoot a guy in this game you really feel like you shot someone (or close enough). I've pegged soldiers to the wall, caused them to fall off railings, bend over railings, get knocked down and then struggle to get back up again, and last but not least, just simply skeletonize them!NEGATIVES: Like all games, this one is not perfect. Even after downloading a 400MB game update I still noticed that my proximity mines had a consistent habit of floating up into the sky. Occasionally the enemy soldiers will get stuck. The level-layout is a bit linear, which can be a good thing if you hate getting lost. And finally, the levels themselves have redundant textures--apparently everyone in this world reads the same two magazines and there's a cruel office policy about personalizing your cubicle. Oh, and coming from a military background, I found it amusing that so many weapons (sensitive items, beyond a doubt) are just lying around in offices, unattended.But to make sure I'm clear, all these negatives are really just nit-picky things.OVERALL: 4.5/5 STARS: I was going to give this 4/5 stars, but the ending was so well done and so DIFFERENT that I can't just shrug it off without giving credit where credit is due. I haven't been this involved in a FPS since Half-Life (can't compare it to HL2, haven't played it yet). Simply put, if you like first-person shooters or the horror genre then you owe it to yourself to play this great game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2006"}

We start out in a cart with other prisoners, headed towards a town to be executed. As we are about to be beheaded, a dragon arrives, killing the townspeople and inadvertently stopping our execution.As we play, we learn of a civil war that not only threatens an already-uneasy truce, but there is a prophesy of the return of Alduin, a Nordic Dragon-god of destruction who could bring about the end of the world.The player is the \"Dovahkiin\" (Dragonborn), a person with the body of a mortal and the soul of a dragon, who might be able to stop Alduin and restore peace to the land of Skyrim.GAMEPLAY:From the start of Skyrim, our character has complete, unbridled freedom to go where they wish and do what they like at a comfortable pace...which is typical for the sandbox/open world games from Bethesda. Even if you've never played any of the previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim is very easy to learn and the story is truly epic to behold.Want to become a skilled archer? You can do that.Want to learn how to cook foods? You can do that.Want to become adept at smashing skulls with a 2-handed hammer? You can do that.Want to scour dungeons for loot to buy a house? You can do that.Want to take a break and read a Choose Your Own Adventure book?YES, YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT IN SKYRIM.Skyrim can be played from a first-person or a 3rd person perspective. Spells and weapons and Dragon Shouts can be hot-keyed and activated with as little as two button presses. Combat can be either up close and personal with a dagger, melee style with a sword, or long distance with a bow. Or you can put a healing spell in one hand and a destruction spell in the other. It's completely up to you.The quests aren't time limited, so the player can complete them at their own pace. It's easy to tell yourself you're going to start off slow and complete only a couple of missions, but then you look at the clock and realize 4 hours have passed. You can choose to stick to the main story but in doing so, you're sure to miss out on hundreds of fun side quests that not only increase your skills, but also increase the coin in your pockets.It's not uncommon to hear yourself thinking:\"I promise, right after I get my Sneaking skill to 100, find a husband, get this talking dog back to his master, find out who this flute belongs to, get this cursed ring off my finger and figure out where to find 3 more Jazbay berries..._THEN_ I'll kill the dragon that's terrorizing your town.\"With regard to my experience, Skyrim was designed with one thing in mind - to pique my curiosity...and it succeeded brilliantly in doing so. I found places to go by talking with city guards, quests to uncover by digging through dungeons, companions that could turn battles in my favor......and I even ran around in my skivvies to laugh at the townspeople's reactions.WHAT KIND OF GLITCHES DID YOU COME ACROSS IN YOUR GAME?During my 186 hours of gameplay I did come across some glitches, which I've listed below.Glitches that occurred between 12/26/11 and 2/19/12 (Patch 1.03 was active during this time):+ Screen freeze after using \"wait\" feature (infrequent)+ Non-playable characters talking in shops though their characters were asleep in bed (infrequent)+ Bounty letters erased when I tried to read them more than once (frequent)+ A \"Floating Dog\" glitch during \"A Daedra's Best Friend\" quest (one time)+ Fast travel loading freeze (infrequent)+ Some stuttered graphics/slow down with multiple characters onscreen (happened after my save file surpassed 8mg - infrequent)+ Killing a dragon but its soul would not transfer to me (about 4 times)+ Unable to edit ledgers during Thieves Guild \"Numbers Job\" (infrequent)Glitches that occurred between 2/19/12 and 3/15/12 (Patch 1.04 was active during this time):+ Character would not stop running for a few seconds after releasing the run key (infrequent)+ Loading screen freeze (infrequent)+ Non-playable character during an Imperial mission was invisible (corrected after reloading)+ Unable to damage Alduin after an autosave reloads (one time)To sum up, most of these glitches were infrequent (and some were even funny), and they never made my Skyrim experience miserable. Between patch 1.03 and 1.04, I noticed the stuttered graphics happened less and the loading screen glitches also happened less. I didn't turn off the autosave feature at all during my game, and my save file grew to 14MB.TROPHIES:There are 50 trophies to earn in Skyrim. Several trophies are fairly easy to unlock by following the main storyline missions, while others will take further efforts to unlock (such as getting a skill to level 100, earning more than 100,000 gold pieces, reading more than 50 skill books, etc.).NOTE: There are some missable trophies, so if you want to complete everything in one run-through, it's a good idea to use a strategy guide. Each trophy feels like a genuine accomplishment and not like a torture session from the game's developers.CONS:The biggest knock to this game is simply this: Bethesda has a history of releasing games with problems being played on the Playstation 3, including Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Oblivion.For people that bought Skyrim when it first released, I have no doubt their gameplay experiences were FAR more glitch-laden than mine was. Skyrim does have its fair share of bugs, and I honestly feel Bethesda is working to minimize these by continuing to research issues and release patches to improve the gameplay. The upcoming Patch 1.05 specifically addresses some of the glitches I mentioned earlier.However...when I order food, I expect it to be prepared. When I buy a Playstation game, I expect it to not have glitches. That's my two cents.FINAL THOUGHTS:With the vast open world, the freedom to explore at my own pace, the conversations I had with townspeople and palace guards, the excitement at reaching another skill tree branch, the freedom to organize my bookshelves and weapon racks, Skyrim wasn't just a game to me...it became my second home.Even though I've completed the Platinum trophy, I find myself yearning to go back and eat a home-cooked meal prepared by my spouse and then read \"The Cake and the Mirror\" in front of a roaring fire.I hope you enjoy Skyrim as much as I did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2012"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file.

Dragon Quest V supplies both in spades.From the main story arc and the heroes down to the minor plot points and secondary characters, everything is very well-developed and a joy to take in.  This game is exemplary of video games as a storytelling art form.The gameplay is a little bit more dated, inventory management in particular being a bit cumbersome, though it does add to the strategy, which is a strong point.  Battles are top-notch turn-based affairs, rivaling Final Fantasy VI (FF3 on SNES) for intensity, and surpassing it in detail.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a good and unique story.

I thought this game was amazing because of how unusual its style was. The cut scenes were hilarious, the game play was especially fun, and it became a very memorable game to me.After hearing about the sequel, I was tempted to purchase a Nintendo Wii just to get both No More Heroes games. This did not seem like too strong of an incentive to do so. I did buy a PlayStation 3 down the line and when I heard about this game being ported for the PlayStation 3, I knew right there and then I made the right choice in not buying a Nintendo Wii JUST for this game series. It was great to have a reason to play and beat this game again (I even got the Platinum trophy because I love this game so much!).It was also a breath of fresh air to be able to switch back and forth from Move to DualShock 3, since my arm got really tired after several hours of game play with the Move.Overall, this was a great purchase and I eagerly wait for the sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003P9C6QY","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Generally Enjoyable, Solidly Constructed","reviewText":"A return to more linear gameplay after \"Red Faction Guerilla\", \"Red Faction Armageddon\" features some fun physics but overall hit-or-miss gameplay.Like the previous Red Faction games, Red Faction Armageddon takes place on Mars in the far future. While Guerilla was an open-world sandbox about undermining a corrupt regime, Armageddon is a far more linear shooter about progressing from point A to point B. This doesn't make it a worse game, but it certainly makes it more limited. The game still has the series' primary feature, \"GeoMod\", which allows for destructible buildings and deformable terrain. Yet while RF1 sometimes used GeoMod to let players create alternative solutions to problems (i.e. tunneling around an obstacle), RFA mostly limits it to \"blowing things up\".Not that \"blowing things up\" isn't fun. The way things collapse and explode is pretty exciting, and between your various explosive weapons and your wall-crushing power hammer, you've got plenty of tools with which to break things. Blow up bunkers to crush the enemies inside, destroy towers to send their inhabitants careening off, or punch holes in walls to move forward. Unfortunately, there are two sorts of enemies: \"cultists\", who use guns and are therefore fun to fight, and \"bugs\", who aren't. The parts of the game where you fight cultists are great; they let you make use of the GeoModding in all sorts of interesting ways and their own explosive weapons means they'll destroy your cover and even collapse things on you. The parts of the game where you fight bugs are terrible, since they just sort of generically mob you and aren't really interesting to fight.Armageddon abandons the relatively conventional aesthetic of previous games to try something sort of daring - a more alien-looking set of designs combined with an abundance of protective goggles and heavy cloaks. This is sort of offset by the incredibly conventional approach to the setting: you start the game in a military transport with a sergeant barking jargon at you, just like hundreds of other games have already done. The focus on this concept is almost baffling since everything else about the game's aesthetic seems to want to move away from \"generic sci-fi FPS\". The usual array of boring FPS weapons are present - assault rifles, shotguns, pistols - but they exist alongside much more interesting weapons. A magnet gun that \"attaches\" one point to another, causing all the matter on the former to careen towards the latter. A plasma gun whose charged-up shots send shockwaves through a structure, collapsing it on impact. A remote-detonated bomb launcher. A rapid-fire grenade launcher that can quickly destroy entire bases. All the explosive weapons, in short, are really fun and interesting and different, and all the \"shoot bullet\" guns are boring and samey.Overall RFA is a decent game - not great, but it's got some good ideas. People who enjoyed Red Faction Guerilla will probably be nonplussed by its linear design, but people who are used to more direct action games will probably have fun with it. It's solidly constructed and has some neat ideas, and while its execution could be better, it's still generally enjoyable.Rating: 7/10.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

Fulkerson","summary":"The best value you will find on ANY platform!","reviewText":"I played the first Halflife back in 1999, and I remember being absolutely blown away by what I saw.  It still is one of the best games I have ever played, so I had high hopes with Halflife 2.  I know that Halflife 2 has been out for five years now, but I can say that it is one of the best and most entertaining video gaming experiences I've ever had!  The controls were as tight as possible, the graphics looked great, and the voice acting was as good as it gets in a video game.  What I respect most about this game is its ability to be many things at once, and still be able to pull it off.  It's a great first person shooter, an engaging adventure game, a creative sci-fi adventure, and an extremely creepy survival horror game all wrapped up in one nice little package.  Some other games try to be all of these things at once and never get it right.  Halflife 2 allows all of these different aspects to mingle with the utmost fluidity and invention.  I've been a gamer for nearly 30 years, and I simply cannot recommend this game highly enough!  I also have to say that Portal totally caught me by surprise with its stunning originality.  It's a very brief game, but with all of the other content on here it's a really nice bonus.And the best part?  This is only 20 bucks!  And you get two expansion packs AND Portal!  I don't really care about the Team Fortress game as I never really play online.  But 20 dollars for four incredibly innovative games is a STEAL.  If you own a PS3 or 360 you'd be foolish to not have this in your library.  I can't imagine a gamer with any life in them disliking Orange Box.

{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Nintendo's Greatest Achievement","reviewText":"It's here. My 3DS came in the mail today, and I was so excited to get started! But first, I had to read the phone book. Not literally, the phone book, I mean the manual for the 3DS. It's freakin' huge, and I obviously didn't bother with reading the whole thing, because I pretty much knew how it worked.The giant box came with the 3DS, charger cord, base thing to charge on, AR cards (which I'll get to later), and a ton of manuals/promotional goodies. My garbage can was filled after opening. So I turned on my 3DS, and had to get briefed on basic information and stuff, and then the 3-D was turned on. Holy Crap...my mind was blown. This device is incredible, to be able to display 3-D without glasses! That's amazing. There is a spot where you get the most of the 3-D, and you sometimes have to position your head so you're right in the sweet spot, which couldn't be helped, but other than that, the 3-D was flawless. It added a whole new layer to an already brilliant handheld.I also picked up Pilotwings: Resort and the review will be up later, but now I'm going to speak about the basic functions included with the 3DS. As most of you know, the 3DS features two 3-D cameras, something I've never seen or used in my entire life, and me, being the photography enthusiast, that was the first thing I went to. The resolution blows, but it's understandable, given that it's a tiny handheld, but the 3-D pictures look awesome, and although they're not 3-D when you place them in a computer, they're still fun to look at and mess around with. Also included is the 3DS sound studio thing, which is basically a repeat of what came with the DSi. Also new is a Mii Maker, which lets you create your adorable little avatars that we all know from the Wii. You can snap a photo of yourself, and your Mii will be made for you, but making it manually is more fun and rewarding.There are some fun games included with the 3DS, one of these being Face Raiders, where you use the 3DS's gyroscoping capabilities to shoot down little bug monsters that have your or your friends' faces on them. It's fun, but by no means is it the star of the show here. I said that the package came with AR cards, short for augmented reality cards. These are little cards that you place on a flat surface, and then your 3DS can read them magically and you can play awesome little minigames with them. It's a lot of fun, and all your favorite Nintendo characters join in, and it's cool to see the world around you change with these cards.I have yet to get to StreetPass and SpotPass abilities, because I haven't even taken a look or found someone with a 3DS yet. Once I do, though, be counting on an in-depth discussion about them. I was pleasantly surprised with the Wi-Fi capabilities this time. The old DS's couldn't read my home's wifi, because we're wired with an Apple network, but my 3DS reads it just fine, just like my Wii would, and now I can finally take full advantage of some old DS games. Speaking of which, the 3DS is fully backwards compatible with previous DS titles, but be noted that there is no GBA slot to be seen, which is kind of a disappointment.The biggest upset, surprisingly, is the battery life. I could only squeeze 4 hours out of my 3DS with 3-D on to the fullest, until it went red and had to be recharged. This is a huge disappointment, especially for long rides or plane flights, when no charge capabilities are in sight. Of course, you could turn the 3-D down and change the brightness level to increase your time.Like almost all of Nintendo's handhelds, the 3DS is phenomenal. What it can do is beyond my thoughts, and I'm really excited to see where it can go in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00JQHU9RC","description":"","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"The game where creativity and imagination walk hand in hand.","reviewText":"I'll admit, I reacted like many people when I first heard about this game: \"Minecraft? Isn't that the game where you build things with blocks? Where's the fun in that?\"When I decided to play it and review it, I was amazed at the reactions I received - not from my friends, but from their children! They couldn't WAIT to tell me their stories about fishing and building minecart tracks and fighting Creepers with diamond swords and battling the Enderdragon...I hadn't even played Minecraft yet, but they were all excited for me to start!GAMEPLAY:Minecraft is an open world game where you create your own gameplay experience. Initially, it looks very simple - you play as an adventurer in a block-style format, and you need to gather items and mine for rare ores to craft items for your adventurer to survive. There isn't much of a story to speak of, and while there is a \"boss battle\", you don't have to fight it if you don't want to. During the day, you can see animals and interact with them - horses, sheep, cows, pigs, wolves, and many more. You can dig and uncover rare ores to fashion new weapons, armor, tools and construction materials.However, when nighttime rolls in, you need to beware: there are several creatures which hunt you down - spiders, zombies, skeletons which shoot arrows, and even the dreaded Creeper - a monster which explodes if you linger too closely!You can play in a peaceful style where no monsters chase you and you aren't in any danger, but this limits your gameplay experience. I decided to play in survival mode, to get the full effect of the game.WHAT WAS IT LIKE, PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME?I was afraid I'd be overwhelmed, but the tutorial mode was extremely easy to follow. It showed me step by step how to get wood from a nearby tree and do some basic crafting. Once this was done, I gathered more materials and put a crafting table together. I fashioned a crude pickaxe for mining and made a wooden sword to protect myself from invaders. With my confidence raised, I created a new world and found a nice stretch of land where I decided to make camp.I thought I was so smart, building a fence to keep out intruders, only to discover I forgot to make a fence gate! I couldn't jump over the fence, so I had to dig under it like Charles Bronson in The Great Escape...which brought a lot of laughs to my child. While I played, she told me about all the dangers I would be facing. I asked how she knew all of this (since she'd never played before), and she answered with a chuckle: \"Come on dad, EVERYONE knows about Minecraft!\"TROPHIES:There are 29 trophies to earn in Minecraft, most of which are creation based. You'll get a few right off the bat by creating various tools and weapons, but some of them (such as killing the Enderdragon or riding for 500 meters in a minecart) will take considerable time and effort to earn.In all honesty, this is probably the first time I've played a PS3 game where I haven't been concerned about earning all the trophies as quickly as possible - and I'm one of the biggest PS3 trophy junkies you will ever meet. My enjoyment of Minecraft comes from creating the best game experience for me...whether it's building a house, fighting a skeleton, crafting new armor, cultivating crops, or finding some of those rare jukebox records!SO...HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?Well, I've come a long way since my first Minecraft session. I've made a well-fortified house with stone walls (zombie proof), a crafting table in one corner and a furnace in the other. On the opposite side I've put three large storage chests, stocked to the brim with various items in case I meet an untimely death from any monsters that roam the wilderness. I have torches which hang on the opposite wall from my bed, so I can drift off to sleep peacefully.While I play, I have the choice of listening to the Minecraft music (which is quite soothing), or I can play any music I've saved to my PS3. I can fish while listening to \"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay\", tend my crops while playing Pink Floyd's \"Learning to Fly\", dig for rare ores to the tune of \"Canary in a Coal Mine\"...the options are pretty much limitless.Even when I'm not playing Minecraft, I'm thinking about Minecraft. I think about mining for rare ores and creating new structures. I think about finding a new area and setting up a house before the night sets in. Even now, while writing this review, I'm thinking about finding the next secret Minecraft has waiting for me.But most of all? I'm thinking about my nephew's face lighting up like a Christmas tree when I tell him about my first steps into this world of limitless creation. He's quite the fan, having made a Pinewood Derby race car modeled after a Creeper, and his last birthday party was Minecraft themed.I've become \"The uncle who plays Minecraft\" - this allows my nephew and I to have fun discussions which weren't possible before I jumped into this game.FINAL THOUGHTS?If you like your video games with scripted starts and finishes, plenty of action or lots of shooting, Minecraft might not be for you. However, if you're looking for a fun game to play by yourself or with family members which encourages creativity and imagination, Minecraft is definitely the way to go.Very highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2014"}

Their only hope lies in  power of the remaining crystals of light and the powers they hold.Can they succeed or will a mad man's twisted dream cover the world in  darkness forever?*-**-**-*If the above description of the story seems a bit bare, that is because the game itself really doesn't focus too much on the story itself.  This is one of those titles where you can see that Square started to get more serious about the story telling in their titles but, its not quite as... robust as it is in later games.  More or less after the introduction the story goes on hold till around the halfway / three quarter part of the game.  It then turns back as the final battle approaches and there is definitely some interesting moments around those points.Until I got to those points though I mostly had fun beating up monsters using this entries focus on the jobs mechanic.There are around twenty jobs and most of them either have a special function or able to use varying levels and types of magic.  For example a black mage can use black magic, a white mage can use white magic and a red mage can use both black and white magic and is also effective as a fighter.  Other specialty classes such as the monk have a higher agility than most classes and can cause massive damage, the Knight has high defense and can cover other characters when they are attacked, and the Geomancer is able to cast random terrain based spells that can cause massive damage.The catch with this system is that the characters job level resets whenever a new job is chosen. There is also a small amount of battles that must be completed before a character &#8220;learns&#8221; the new job, this means the characters stats are very low for a few battles. This happens every time a job is switched.  Generally this means it is not a good idea to switch your entire party to new jobs in a difficult dungeon as you will probably get demolished.I didn't really have a problem with this system until around the end of the game as this is when the final jobs become available for selection. I tend to want the latest and greatest when I get new abilities so I &#8220;upgraded&#8221; all my characters to their next logical class.  The problem with this is that I now had a level 4o or so party that had job levels of 1.  This sort of thing is common with older rpgs as they often require a lot of &#8220;grinding&#8221;, leveling your party by beating up a lot of monsters before progressing, but I took the easy way out as there is a &#8220;trick&#8221; you can use to make sure that all your characters will gain a job lever after battle. Just Google the game and most walkthroughs mention it.  Or do it the old fashioned way, I just didn't have that much patience.There are also side quests that you can perform if you have a internet connection and know someone else that owns the game.  I don't, so I can't speak on that part of the game.All in all this a great game if you like old fashioned role playing games, are looking for a simple dungeon crawler, or are just interested in final fantasy games. m.a.cTime Played: 52 HoursFinal Party: Dark Knight, Sage, Magus, NinjaFinal Level: Around 63Story: The story in this game doesn't start off strong, but towards the end there are a few interesting moments.  The story is linear though so it's A to B to C... as far as I know there is nothing that changes the flow of the story. So you might want to find a FAQ so you can find everything. Also there is some kind of New Game plus. I didn't play it, so I'm not sure what's in it.Game Play: I had fun with it. Standard NES/SNES RPG game play  The battle system is not complicated.  It's turn based so the player attacks an then the enemies do.  The battles move pretty fast.  In this game I found it easiest to set the cursor to remember in the options since there is no auto battle option.  As I pointed out earlier most jobs have one function that they tend to use.  This just made it easier as I could just keep hitting A when I was trying to level.Graphics: This is a remake so the graphics are updated for the DS. They do their job and most of the character and monsters look good.  One interesting option that they added was the ability to zoom in so that hidden items or doors have a sparkle that makes them easier to find. It seems to work on and off though. I usually walked around the towns and found more hidden goodies by tapping a constantly.Controls: The game can be controlled by both the stylus and the control buttons. I chose to play using the control buttons as they are what I am used to. The stylus control seems a little touchy but it works well enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"The New Sonic and the Old Sonic Face Off!  (by Laura)","reviewText":"I'm just going to be frank and say exactly what this game is: in order from the highest emphasis to the lowest emphasis, this game is a mixed package of fighting, speeding, and basic puzzle solving.  If none of these things appeal to you, leave NOW.. . . Many Sonic fans are, sadly, disappointed with this game; and this is simply because they think it's one thing, when it's really another.  Sonic Unleashed introduces the new concept of Sonic's Werehog form; and, admittedly, Sega milks it for all of its worth here.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but this has received poor, and sometimes unfair, reactions from Sonic fans all over.  Just to be perfectly clear: Sonic Unleashed does emphasize the fighting element (no blood or guts or anything, but still a lot of fighting).  Yes, there are a few stages that emphasize the normal Sonic's speed; but they are far and few between.  More used as refreshing breaks to keep the sense of monotony from settling in.  In addition, puzzles are involved too, in the form of the Gaia temples, and sometimes even in the levels themselves.  Personally, I give Sega credit for trying to put something for everyone in this; I'm okay with fighting games, love Sonic's speeding games, and enjoy puzzle games, so I can fully enjoy and appreciate this entire game in itself.  It's true, I laughed at the concept of a \"Werehog,\" at first; but that made me no less excited for this game's release.  Put into practice, it also works; however, this game was MADE for the Wii.  On any other system, it would be incredibly boring to be a werehog; but there is something incredibly satisfying with swinging your arms and knocking the blocks off of the foes in game in the progress.  To wrap this review up, I'm going to grade some of the game's qualities; A+ being the highest score, and F- being the lowest:Graphics A: The graphics were VERY beautiful!  This is especially noticeable in the cut scenes and day stages.  In the night stages, they start lacking slightly; but they still manage to keep up to where it's hardly noticeable.Storyline A: The story was very engaging!  Your main goal is to stop Eggman from trying to conquer the world (again), and put the pieces of the earth back together.  Chip and Proffessor Pickle are comical characters who join you, and often provide comic relief throughout the story's intensity.  Amy is in there too; but, sadly, no Knuckles or Shadow, which is a shame.  Still, the storyline is pretty creative, as far as Sonic storylines go.Controls A: To me, the controls were pretty smooth.  The camera did get tricky occasionally on the night levels (as others have mentioned) and also occasionally seemed to have trouble handling Sonic's speed; but, overall, it is a wonderful experience to swing your arms to bash enemies, and control the normal Sonic somewhat traditionally with the buttons.Difficulty A-: The game's difficulty kept changing drastically for me.  The night stages, though time consuming, are pretty easy once you get the hang of them; even the later night stages are incredibly forgiving.  The day stages, on the other hand, got VERY hard at times, especially when I tried to get an S rank.  Some of the times needed for an S rank, on the day stages, seemed ridiculous; while the times on the night stages seemed almost more than reasonable enough.  The boss battles also tended to be on the challenging side, but nothing really too discouraging (except maybe for the very last boss); the puzzles, on the other hand, were on the easy side, at least as far as the Gaia temple was concerned.  The puzzle of trying to find unlockable items (small bubble-like containers with question marks in them) and secret areas were sometimes easy and sometimes a nightmare; there were a couple I searched levels several times for, and STILL had to get help through FAQs on the internet.  All in all, however, the puzzles and item hunts were usually enjoyable.Gameplay A-: The day stages are fun to blast through, and don't take up much time.  The village areas where you have to talk to the people may seem kind of slow at first, but it's easy to get into once you start getting to know the locals.  The Werehog stages are slow going, but it's helped with Were-Sonic's dash move and level up feature.  My main complaint is that the night stages are too long; an average night stage can take 8-10 minutes to complete and, let's face it, many people don't have that kind of time.  The stages are so long, that I often have to pause to do something like go to the bathroom, and then return to it a little while later. . . .Music A: VERY good music!  Great hits like \"Endless Possibilities\" REALLY get your blood pumping!  There is kind of a sappy song that's introduced in the credits, but sappy songs are really rare here.  The majority of the music is really great, fits the mood, and is very memorable.  I have a couple of the tunes sticking in my head, even as I'm writing this review.Other A: This covers stuff like unlockable features, and multiplayer capabilities.  Sonic Unleashed, by the way, is single player only; which is fine for a solo gamer like myself, but will obviously hurt the game's value for those who often play with friends.  The unlockable artwork is pretty interesting, as well as the \"secret documents\" (hints on where to find certain items), movies, and music.  On the downside, absolutely EVERYTHING has to be unlocked before it can be accessed (music must be found in the levels, movies have to be ventured across in the storyline, etcetera), so you'll be enjoying little right away.  On the plus side, there's a cute little video that can be accessed if you complete the entire game; whether it's worth the effort beats me, but it's still a fun little tidbit.Conclusion: Sonic Unleashed is a game of variety.  It is best enjoyed by someone who likes a little bit of everything; although, the werehog fighting stages ARE exaggerated a great deal.  If you're looking for the world's greatest \"traditional\" Sonic game, then this game is not for you; but if you want a fresh new experience that brings other elements into play, like fighting, than this is DEFINITELY a pretty high-class pick-me-up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2009"}

Switching weapons from numbers 1 through to 9 is absent from the new game and now uses the switch system, 2 guns, one button to switch, I suppose its not too bad.I like how the game hasn't tried to do too much different, especially seeing pig cops again while running around really brings back memories of duke nukem 3D.I give the game a 8.8 out of 10, playing as Duke again is heaps of fun, and as a whole package, it really was worth buying if your a duke nukem fan!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

Star Fox on the Nintendo 64? 2ND BEST GAME ON THAT SYSTEM (The first is Ocarina of Time)! Every level was packed with thrilling action! On the first level I enjoyed an easy ride along Corneria, gliding across the lakes listening to Peppy complain. The 2nd level (Meteo) really picked up the pace, and the drama was incredible for the Nintendo 64. The level opens with Peppy saying \"It's quiet. Too quiet.\", quickly followed by, \"LOOK OUT IT IS A TRAP!!!!\", followed by a hoard of enemies, then giant meteors, ending with the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in a video game. A giant space craft swoops down and a monkey with a british accent says \"I can not allow you to go any further\". After a short time the british monkey says \"I am no match for you. I admit defeat.\" The whole game goes silent, and then the monkey yells \"IF THIS DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!\". He fires a huge amount of lasers, and then calls me scum after I defeat him. Time for Level 3! This one was also disturbing, but provided the greatest thrill I had ever had. The Star Wolf team comes in, saying some very creepy comments while they beat me. \"You'll be with your dad soon Fox!\" (Fox's dad is dead), \"I'm going to bust you up REAAALLL good!\" (says the pig who betrayed Fox's dad), and \"Go back to the pond, Froggy.\". Then, right in the middle of that big fight, the robot assistant comes in and says \"DANGER! A bomb has been discovered in the base! Explosion in 1 minute!\" Level 4 was at the climax of wierdness, though. A giant terminator-like robot came in and started repeating \"DESTROY! DESTROY!\". I have not been able to get level 4, the robot always crushes me and then I get Game Over. I do highly this game, though. It is possibly the most thrilling game on the N64! Trust me, it is addicting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

The brilliance of this game is the new gameplay mechanics introduced.  No longer do you have dumb units to command around the map.  Company of Heroes introduces a cover system, and when your units fall under attack, they automatically move to cover but not to the point of messing up your line of defense.The different factions of the game have different strengths and weaknesses utilizing a different set of units and weapons.

Covino","summary":"A Refreshing New Horror Game","reviewText":"Federal Agent, Francis York Morgan, is investigating an unexplained phenomenon: serial killers everywhere, with no relation with one another, have all strangely been committing the same ritualistic style of murder with all their female victims. This most recent one, a lady named Anna, has led Francis York Morgan to the small hick town of Greenvale.Now lets talk about Greenvale. Greenvale is a big sandbox style town. The set up is similar to the Grand Theft Auto games. It's a Two Part Town, surrounded by country roads and a nearby lake. It's only got one gas station, grocery store, a few restaurants and bars, a hospital, a Sheriff Station, and a couple other locations. As the story unfolds and your investigation leads you to various places on the map, the town becomes very much like a real place. You get to know a lot of the people who live there and, like the Japanese often do, they've created very memorable characters.You got George Woodman, the town Sheriff who doesn't take too kindly to big headed Federal Agents interfering with local affairs. Emily, the Sheriff deputy that likes your character. You got Isaach and Isaac, the twin boys that found Anna's body in the woods, their Grandpa, who looks after the kids while their parents, Keith and Lilly Ingram, work at the grocery store. You Have Sally, Anna's mother. Becky Ames, Anna's best friend. Quint, Becky's boyfriend....and each of these people are hiding something and depending upon your actions, you can learn more about them. You can actually drive door to door to meet with them for interviews. This opens up a good number of sidequests.Then of course you have Francis York Morgan himself. You gotta love this guy because no matter what happens--like flipping over his car on a rainy night and escaping death by mere seconds--he remains completely unfazed. Everyone else might be panicking around him, but he keeps his cool. In fact the only thing that makes him lose his composure is food. Those of you that have played the game know what I'm talking about. Never mind the fact he spent the whole night fighting off hoards of zombies, Francis York Morgan has got his eye on them freshly baked Biscuits. He talks to his coffee. In fact, a lot of his investigative intuition comes directly from the coffee he drinks. Okay? Furthermore, he has a second personality, Zach, that he talks to, even in front of other people. But no one questions him because there's no denying his effectiveness at solving the murder case.So what makes this game a horror game? Well, every time the murderer strikes, it rains, and when it rains, York is transported into another dimension that looks like a distorted reflection of the town, where zombie-like creatures come out from the walls and attack him. And again, he's completely unfazed by all this, considering it merely something he doesn't understand. Nobody else seems to experience these recurring events and he doesn't tell anyone else about it because he fears they'll deem him completely insane.But this game is not a Survival Horror in the traditional sense where the player is in constant danger. It's more about the investigation, driving around interviewing people, and following a really good story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2010"}

THIS IS NOT A GOOD HORROR GAME don't expect survival horror there are too many weapons and an abundance of ammo to be a horror game. The story and character is what you'll most enjoy.Its an open world game too, the world is big enough to explore but you'll find nothing much to do except drive and walk on foot. Its not all bad as there are locations where you can play mini games.Graphics are a mixed bag, The character models are detailed but they lack good animation. Facial animation is very lacking. The environment lack the same detail and you'll see pop ins and jaggies throughout the open world.Voice acting is okay it won't win any awards for good voice acting. Sometimes the characters animation dont match with what the characters are saying and all around they are passable and the actors do their jobs well enough to convey.So why is this game worth your time? Like I said earlier the game is bizarre, many will raise eye brows as to some of the characters and how they act. Its a quirky game that embraces its quirkiness. The story at first seems like a plot of a TV murder mystery but it gets more weirder and interesting that by the time you think you figured it out something else happens that you'll want to continue playing.Its an odd game that will be admired for its quirkiness and appreciated for mixing different gameplay. Its a budget title so its definitely worth it since its going cheaper now then before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}

I went into this game with high hopes because the game got such good reviews and I'm such a huge fan, however, I came out confused and ultimately very upset. It's not like the game is a complete mess and doesn't do anything right, it's just not fun and overall unbelievably forgettable. Let's start with the graphics: At times, I felt like I was playing an early xbox 360 game, but most of the time it felt like a ps2 game or something, especially the outside portions of the game. I found them to be blurry and lacking detail. Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is atrocious to say the least. The mechanics and everything are fine, but it takes too many bullets to take down certain enemies and overall it's just very repetitive and not fun at all. I would equate this game to left for dead because the enemies come and keep on coming. They are relentless and you don't even have time to look around at the environment. This game is not even in the same league as halo, so don't even say it. Now, I would go over some other things in the game, but if you're like me then the gameplay is probably the most important thing and you already know how I feel about it, so I will leave you with a list of my favorite fps games of all time and you can see why I thought this game was crap.

I bought this game to play in online leagues and was really excited to see the update from last years version. The \"pure analog\" controls are absolutely usless online. You can pitch well enough, but hitting is impossible. This game is the epitome of PS3 lag. I just don't understand how Sony can continue to put out online-screw-up after online-screw-up.

Daneker","summary":"The RPG of the year if not the decade","reviewText":"You are Geralt, the wife wolf, biologically enhanced with super reflexes and healing powers, magic, alchemy and the sword are at your disposal, and there are monsters everywhere, which is good for you, it's your to kill them.The first \"Witcher\" released last year turned a lot of heads and turned a lot of gamers off as well. Sure the graphics are hyper-realistic, the fighting system dynamic blending RPG and Action together in a way similar but superior to \"Diablo\" or \"Neverwinter Knights\" and the story is epic, complex and ripe with side-quest, complex characters and decisions that really make a difference in how the game unfolds, but the glitches. The first Witcher was a mess of ultra long loading times, cloned NPG's, annoyingly repetitive and stifled dialogue that cloaked the brilliant game and sent some gamers back to the store for refunds.The new \"Witcher\" is free to customers with the original disk, I opted however to buy it again. Why? Because the \"Enhanced Edition\" comes with a 112 pg guide (which is unfortunately small enough to fit in a DVD box) as well as a nice fold-out map. A game editor, new quest and two CD's of music from or inspired by plus a print book of a short story from which the game and characters arose. Again, all this is available in digital form for free to those who purchased the old version, but I wanted the print copies.So, the pros? Well, the loading times are vastly cut, but the game takes up to a WHOPPING 13 GIGS of HD space and a minimum of 9. Most of the dialogue has been re-written and re-recorded to great effect, this is all good. The cut scenes are still boring to watch, though a little more movement has been added. Overall, the presentation and loading issues are all solved and extra quest are always good and welcome. If you're in the middle of the game you can update now and keep playing your old saved games, you don't have to start over. They also added and auto-sort system for you items and alchemy ingredients.The Cons? The game takes up 13 gigs of space on a full install and still requires the disk to run. The game claims to be optimized for x64 and dual processors, but I have to make sure everything on my notebook is shut down to run the game with decent frame rates, version 1.3 ran at a better frame rate for me. This version seems to take more resources, I don't know why.Now, what systems am I running on? I have two. The first is my notebook. I run a Turion x64 dual-core @1.8 X 2 ghz, 4 Gig 4-4-4-12 ram, 7200rpm sata 100gig hd, on a 1680 X 1050 hi-def monitor but I have the Witcher settings @ 1280 X 800. Runs 25 - 45 FPS as long as all other programs are shut down, including the side-bar and back-ground programs.My other system is a custom desk-top I built myself.(updated 10/20/09) I have an ASUS M3N HT DX MOBO with a Phenom Black x64 2.6ghz true quad-core, 8 gig 5-5-5-15 ram and 2 GTX250 SLI cards with 2gig DDR4 Ram. Running at full graphics at 1440 X 900 resolution the game is smooth and frame rates are 60fps steady. Still, the video cut-scenes look jagged (there are verticle lines on the people.)As for the gameplay? This looks a lot like a \"Diablo\" style game, but it's not. \"The Witcher\" is a game about story and characters, an old school RPG. The Witcher is what gamers who are tired of MMOG and FPS games are looking for. This is definitely a game for fans of \"Final Fantasy\" or even \"Zelda\". This game is an addiction, it sucks you right in and keeps you hooked. The game has three levels of difficulty and I highly suggest starting with \"easy\" so you can focus on the story and exploration and save the harder levels for you second time around. Why? Because the harder levels require more alchemy and fighting skills, it's longer and more frustrating and if you want to experience the narrative without being hindered by trying to become stronger and better stocked constantly, then easy is the way to go. I also prefer the OTS mode, I use an optical track-ball mouse that gives me great 360 degree movement.Overall, excellent game, just exceptional, but a huge resource hog that needs a powerful PC to look really good and will translate well to a PS3 if they ever go that way. If you like RPG's then this is the must own this year, if not this decade.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2008"}

Also, it was by Square Enix, and many of my favorite games of all time have been developed by them. So I picked it up, anticipating another captivating adventure.The graphics were, indeed all that had been promised. The character models were great, especially in the cutscenes, and the environments were pretty. This was the sole element of the game that I was completely satisfied with.The story was OK, although I didn't get very far in it. Before long, though, it began to get annoying. The characters had no personality beyond weak sterotypes, and the dialogue had no surprises or hooks to keep you interested. It was all very bland and cliched. Basically, this was the story: Boy meets girl, boy and girl hang out, both kids' parents disappear in tragic accident, boy wakes up in mysterious land and is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, boy meets sexy girl in thigh-high boots and a miniskirt and, without much explanation, is led through a mysterious secret passage. Yawn.Perhaps if I had stuck with the story longer, it would have improved. But what kept me from progressing in the game was the combat. It has an interesting concept behind it; everything is in real-time, and you can actively dodge an enemy's attacks. Try as I might, though, I couldn't get my character to do anything except rush the monster and wail on it until it died. I learned a few special skills, but the game never explained how to use them. Sometimes, I would manage to pull one off, but it was usually a surprise, as I couldn't figure out what I had done to make it happen. I had heard that the combat was a \"joy\" to participate in, but it was continually frustrating for me. I couldn't believe that not even the freaking in-game tutorial explained how to use skills.Finally, the music sucks. I know this doesn't sound like a major issue, but believe me, ten minutes with this stuff and you'll feel like jumping out the nearest window. The hotel where the game starts has an irritating, Japanese-sounding pop song; later, a forest area has the loudest, most banging heavy metal you'll ever hear. The soundtrack never fits the situation, and is always horrible.I couldn't stand this game, and I doubt you'll be able to either. This is NOT Square-Enix's next masterpiece. If you're looking for an RPG with a fast-paced battle system, try Baten Kaitos or Tales of Symphonia instead. Don't even touch this thing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2005"}

Truth be told, cowering in fear was probably the best option for them, because Modern Warfare 2 is a colossal game, both in the inevitable sales numbers, and (as I will be focusing on) the content. Now, I can safely say that Modern Warfare 2 deserved the hype and sheer anticipated surrounding its release; with nearly perfected gameplay and a baffling amount of content, Modern Warfare 2 is not a game you'll want to miss out on.As the first of the game's \"Three Pillars\", it goes without saying that the campaign has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, it does for the most part. The same great fusion of tactical and run-and-gun gameplay is still there, coupled with the series' trademark variety, scripted-sequences, and a ridiculous amount of set-piece moments.As the first entry in the series to be a direct sequel, Modern Warfare 2, naturally, picks up a little while after Call of Duty 4 ended. With the Horsemen down, a new bad guy steps up to take their place, Vladimir Makarov, and it's up to Task Force 141 to take him down.What Modern Warfare 2 has that no other Call of Duty game had is characters. The supergroup of terrorist-hunting badasses, known as Task Force 141 makes pretty memorable characters out of its two leads, Soap (the silent protagonist from CoD4, now your squad leader), and Ghost. The game's principal baddy, Makarov, is also one of the most dastardly villains in video game history (although I won't spoil anything here).Unfortunately, however, the lengths at which the game goes in order to attempt to capture those same \"wow\" moments from the first Modern Warfare turn the campaign's set-pieces into a series of scenes in which Infinity Ward tries to one-up themselves. That's not a bad thing, most of these scenes are thoroughly enjoyable, even if they are quite ridiculous, but it still would have been better if they didn't try so hard.The new mode introduced in Modern Warfare 2 is Special Ops, a mode that lets you and a friend tag team to take down terrorist through 23 mini-missions. These missions are mostly new scenarios taking place in locales from the campaign, although there are occasionally recreations of moments from Call of Duty 4 (such as the awesome AC-130 level), and totally new environments.These missions feature a lot of variety, and capture pretty much everything the singleplayer campaign has to offer: simple shootouts, stealth infiltrations, vehicle races, and ,my personal favorite, the on rails missions (in which one player plays an infantryman who must get to a certain point, while the other is in a helicopter, or AC-130 covering them).Once you start a play-session with a buddy, you'll be sucked in, and thanks to the brutal difficulty of some of the missions, and the three-star grading system used for each level, you'll quickly become addicted to this newcomer mode.The adversarial multiplayer, at this point, is damn close to perfection. The game retains the same EXP system, allowing players to level up, and earn new weapons, perks, and gear by killing tons of people.In addition to all the old types of unlocks, players can now earn emblems, and titles for their Callsign (which pops up when you kill other players), and new Killstreak Rewards. The sheer amount of unlockables is jaw-dropping, and the constant rate at which they're given out keeps the reward center in your brain totally satisfied, and ready to play more.As with before, there are about a dozen modes with a staggering amount of variety (even to the point of useless novelties like 3rd-Person deathmatches), but, as with before, people pretty much only play Team Deathmatch. There are a whopping 16 maps, most of which are very well designed, and sprawl through pretty much all of the game's locales (although one is disappointingly absent).With the new emphasis on Killstreak Rewards, there are some new balance issues that can arise, especially when one plays against a particularly good player, but match ruining situations such as the infamous Tactical Nuke are few and far enough in between that it doesn't ruin the fun.Modern Wafare 2's multiplayer is the most complete, fleshed-out multiplayer of any game to date. With a massive amount of challenges, rewards, maps, modes, and most importantly, fun, countless hours will be stolen away from you, and you'll love every second of it.From a technical standpoint, Modern Warfare 2 is a beast of a game. The graphics engine, while perhaps not overly flashy, is great, and things run at a smooth 60 FPS the whole time. Character models are richly detailed, and brought to life by impressive voice acting from the likes of Keith David, Barry Pepper, and even 50 Cent. The sound department, as always, is truly perfect, with a pulse-pounding score, great sound effects, and the always insanely detailed battle-chatter. Modern Warfare 2 isn't the best looking game out there, but the production values are still through the roof.Looking at just the campaign, Modern Warfare 2 isn't exactly a value package, coming in at around six hours (just to warn you offline gamers). But, across all of the \"Three Pillars\" the hours start to add up. After beating the singleplayer, getting at least one star in each Special Ops mission, and getting to level 40 in multiplayer, my playtime clocked in at around 35 hours, and I'm still far from being complete, or wanting to be finished with this game.Modern Warfare 2 is one of those rare games that's more than the sum of its parts, yet if you break down each part individually, they're all outstanding. The campaign is excellent, Special Ops has some great white-knuckled action and loads of challenge, and the adversarial multiplayer is pretty much perfect. Add on great production values, and ridiculously high replay value, and you're set.I see now why all those other games made way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

Allen","summary":"Sums up in one word: frustrating.","reviewText":"I got this in November of 09 and decided to review it nearly a year later.The game can be summed up in one word: frustrating. Eventually I gave it up and decided no more call of duty games due to the fact that I don't like the direction MW2 gave.When I first played COD4:MW, I think, like others, wanted more variety in the game. The weapon sets were limited, the perks were limited, and the killstreak rewards were limited.MW2 sort of took the original MW game and gave it more choices, more weapons, various perks, and offered a wider range of killstreak rewards.This sounds great, but in my opinion, less is more in the case of online gaming. The simple problem with MW2 is balance. Since there are so many weapons and killstreaks, it's nearly impossible to balance the game. I felt when comparing this with the original, the original offered a more balanced game (although not THE balanced game, but definitely more balanced when comparing to the second one).Now to get into details of why I felt MW2 was a very frustrating experience for me. First the weapons. The weapons layout are just awesome. You get many different types of weapons and attachments to the weapon. However, here comes the bad part: the game seems to be easier when you exploit weapons. For example, if you have One Man Army perk, which is basically a perk that allows you to switch class and reset the ammunition count, you can exploit the fact that you get unlimited grenades and grenade launchers. This means now you don't have to aim or nothing. You can continuously lob grenades and launch grenades and just switch back to the same layout with your One Man Army perk. That's just one of many exploits you can do.Of course, that is just one simple exploit. Common sense and logic would tell you to avoid that player, right? Well, no can do. The spawning system of this game is just horrendous. Other games have spawn points, which can cause you to get spawn trapped in some cases. MW and MW2 tried to prevent this by spawning you at different parts of the map when you die. There seems to be a logic behind it such as you spawn close to your team that way you seemingly can have a better chance. Now here comes the frustrating part: in most cases when you die, you spawn exactly where you previously spawn that caused you to die! Now a smart player would acknowledge/exploit this behavior. You know when you just killed someone, they're nearby and you can either wait for them since you know they'll come to the area you're in, or you can simply avoid that player especially if he's exploiting the weapons. The frustrating side of it comes that if you die, you can easily get \"trapped\" especially if the other player is exploiting weapon behavior. For example, one game at an Airport (Terminal) map, I got killed by a person exploiting the One Man Army perk. So I watch the Killcam just to get an idea of what I can do since I know now I'm in trouble. As soon as I respawn, which is exactly where I got killed, he's still around and lobs another grenade. At this point, I'm thinking just bad luck and I can get him. So I respawn, again, not exactly where I was but near enough such that he can lob another grenade. So at this point, I'm continuously trapped and I can either keep trying until either I can sneak around, or I can switch to a class that exploits, or I can simply wait until my teammate come through. So it gets really, really frustrating because there is no balance against this other than to do exactly what the other player is doing.Of course there are just so much wrong with this game that I can write an entire book on it. But let's face it, MW2 is about coming to the end of its life. I can't believe that such a great game is wasted. I'm unsure if Black Opts will be different, but it seems like there are some major balancing issues needing to be corrected.So at the end of the day, the game is severely unbalanced which causes great frustration. When the game seems to be working (which is rarely the case because you'd have to play with friends or just happen to have a group of people trying to play well) you can have a lot of fun. I don't do well, but I do just get by however when I'm continuously getting exploited and unable to put up a fair fight, I feel frustrated. So to be honest, I feel that the game needs to be looked at from a balancing perspective rather than realism. This is a game based on reality, but at the same time it should be made for balance so that way everyone can have fun with what they want to do, but don't have to worry too heavily on something unfairly giving an advantage to one particular setup.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"GTA IV, best ever!!!","reviewText":"Well, I bought the game when it came out. I have to say that this game is very good. At first, the controls were a little difficult. I've noticed that some of buttons that was used to do actions in the previous GTA titles, they've changed. The gameplay is fun. I love the gun fights. I mean, the player is given the option to shoot with the lock-on or shoot freely. This gives the player an advantage, while in gun fights. I love the weaponry. I love to use the grenades. The explosions are very intense. It is good to use them to clear rooms with several enemies.There is other details that make the game spectacular. First, there is the use of the cell phone. The cell phone plays a huge role in the game. A player can dial it like a real phone. Text messages can be received, and the ring tone can be changed. Out of curiosity, I even dialed 911 and was able to choose whether I wanted a police, firefighter or ambulance to come to my location. Very neat. Also, I randomly killed a man. When I when to get his money, I noticed that I actually walked on top of him and he moved. I've never seen a game where someone can walk on a dead body and it actually moves. Lots of detail there. Also, I like how the GPS system gives street by street directions on how to get to a certain location. That GPS comes in handy. Didn't you hate having to remember locations in the previous GTA games?People who reviewed this game said that the graphics are almost like PS2. I don't agree. The graphics and the lighting is exceptional. When I was in a car, I was driving under a bridge and I could see the moving shadows of the train riding by. This game is top-notch. The graphics are even better with an HDTV. Another thing that makes this version of GTA different from the others is that the games changes, depending on the decisions that the player will have to make. For example, there will be certain characters that in the game, which the player will be given a choice to kill them or let them live. Depending on the action that is taken, the game will change. Therefore, this game will probably have to be played twice. I would say that this is the best GTA, yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"\"tspcr\"","summary":"Top 10 Moment","reviewText":"The previous reviewer is right. The graphics could have been so much better, they weren't bad, just not great. I also had problems with the games AI. Enemy soilders followed the same routine from location to location and allied soliders have a bad habbit of putting themselves in bad spots and sometimes even blocking your movement. I also wished some of the missions could have been more squad based like the opening sequence.Otherwise, what a fantastic game. It was like being thrust into every war story that my grandfather ever told me. A video game tribute to the greatest generation.Besides the graphics, other aspects of the game were great. The sound track...WOW...worthy of any big buget movie. The ambient sounds also added much to the realism of the game. Again agreeing with the previous reviewer, a surround sound system makes you want to play the game just to listen to it. At the very least, a good stero TV is a must.If you like FPS and WWII story lines then this game has what your looking for. It's like Indian Jones meets Private Ryan, only you are not hunting for lost treasures. This game made my top 10 gamming moments list. Any game that has a moment where you just say wow with wide eyes. That's the opening sequence in this game (despite the graphics).The game has been out for sometime now and you should be able to get it at a discounted price so go for it. It makes a great addition to anyones FPS library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2003"}

Some cool mission designs, decent graphics, easy to pick up hard to master awesome sound, and an overall good presentation.  The sound is unbelieveable.  The voices, the explosions, and the bullets, this game sounds awesome.  It really feels like your in WWII.  The control is tricky, and hard to aim fast.  I think they could have done a better job.  No slowdown but the game stays at a constant framerate of 30.  Graphics are good with the backrounds and all but the character models need some work.  They look a bit unhuman and not really well put together.  Like I said earlier, the sound is amazing, and it really unveals itself in the d-day mission.

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

This is a lot of fun with great graphics and a very cinematic feel. It can be a bit cumbersome to go through all the dialogue to stay in touch with what is going on in the game but it is worth it for the immersion experience.  The voice acting is excellent and the dialogue is done well.  Unlike many games with cheesy lines and poor acting, this is on the scale of a decent Hollywood movie. If you are into run-n-gun like Left for Dead, do not buy this game. If you like RPG Shooters, BUY THIS.The battles are fun albeit a bit unchallenging so far but fun none the less.  The weapons and mod systems are easy to use and controlling your squad is straight forward (but challenging to master, thankfully) via to a well designed interface.  The slick thing is there are various elements needed to build and research upgrades and such you need to locate given amounts to obtain new items.  Although there is no rhyme or reason as to where to look for these (it seems you stumble on them) maybe that was part of the design.Your choices in dialogue do have an effect as I have saved and went back and tried a different tact with different results.....very cool. You can be a ball buster, fight, threaten and control with an iron fist or a nice guy helping others or whatever blend you choose and your character builds on the fly. While there is a point system to assign to skills, it is hassle free and simple.From playing in an unfolding story to battling, gaining info, researching and earning new skills & weapons along with some of the general missions to find things that are needed and transfer to those in need, this is a mercenary, bounty hunter, scavenger game that so far been fun. Lastly, I generally prefer 1st Person but the camera and angle in this are excellently done so I have adapted to this quickly and like it (unlike Gears of War)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Chris Swanson \"I'm just this guy, you know?\"","summary":"Be a hero!","reviewText":"Ah, the \"Hero\" games. I really liked some of the \"Guitar Hero\" games and I'm looking forward to \"Lego Rock Band\" (not part of the same series, but at least the same idea). Mind you, I pretty much suck at these games, but still I find them to be enjoyable.Now comes \"DJ Hero\" the latest incarnation of the \"Hero\" series. I spent some time last night playing with a demo version of it, and I found it... decent. Not great, but decent.The basic idea is the same as the other games. You hear music, you see the screen telling you what buttons to press and you do as you're told. Easy to learn, difficult to master, as some might say.I actually found the learning curve on this to be steeper than I liked. The easy setting isn't as easy as I might prefer and the medium setting (where you have to use the cross-fader), is entirely too difficult. I had a friend over and he aced the easy section, but once the cross-fader was introduced, he was totally doomed.One nice feature of the game is that you can have someone use a guitar controller and play in a vs mode against each other. My friend and I did that, and it worked out fairly well, though you're each playing a different track and that might take a little getting used to.I also found the positioning of the blue button on the turntable to be a little awkward. Scratch moves are a big part of the game, and they're easy to do with the green button, but very hard with the blue button. On the other hand, the turntable controller includes lefty support, and as a southpaw, I'm pleased with that.The game's equivilent of the \"star power\" feature from the guitar games is called \"Euphoria\" and it works out ok, as does the \"rewind\" feature that allows you to back up a few seconds and reply a few notes.I was also reasonably pleased with the selection of songs. I had only a demo version of the game, so the selection was limited to only a few songs, but they were well done and easy to listen to. As for the graphics, they were supremely good and looked great on my new 42\" LCD TV, though my DJ looked hideous.Overall I enjoyed the time I had with the game. I don't know that I'd buy a copy any time soon, but maybe once it's a Greatest Hits kind of thing. I just don't enjoy the whole dj experience or dj culture enough to want it at full price. Those who do enjoy such things will likely really get a kick out of this game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

As a loyal Guitar Hero/Rock Band player, I really wanted to give this a try to see how the game has branched out into other avenues.The turntable is pretty cool, it spins a drop too easily and lacks the feel of a real record being scratched with any resistance.  The cross fader is simply a cross fader and the three buttons for game play are placed finely on the \"record\".  The buttons click well and are easily recognized but it's very easy for the record to spin too far and you lose the buttons around to the other side and completeley lose your spot in the song.The graphics are really exactly what one would expect from this franchise, obviously swithcing the dirty, dive bar scene to the elite club scene.  The crowd is cool, they hang on to your efforts and they cheer along with your mixing of the songs.  It had a good vibe to it.I love the fact that one player can pick up a guitar and play along with the DJ, that would certainly suit a couple whom want to play together.Overall, I would probably stick to the Guitar Hero franchise, but I'm a metalhead first and a gamer second, so the dance club scene simply doesnt apply to me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

As of this writing, I have completed Prey on \"Normal Skill\" and am now working my way through the \"Cherokee Skill\" difficulty setting. (NOTE: These are the only two difficulty settings available in Prey.)To state it upfront, Prey blows the FPS genre wide open. The game uses the Doom 3 engine for graphics, and players will be amazed with the level of detail the designers have put into each level. Moreover, many of the items in the environment are interactive (you can flush toilets, change the channels on a TV, etc.), which is reminiscent of the Duke Nukem 3D game that this developer is famous for. In addition, the main character makes snide remarks through the game (just infrequently enough to be funny, and not overdone) just like Duke used to do.Even if you're not entertained by all the cute gimmicks, you're sure to appreciate the incredible details that have been woven into this title. As you progress, you'll encounter anti-gravity levels, low gravity environments and \"wormholes\" that warp you from one location to the next. And, like the game design, the plot is equally intricate. Although this game seems like a \"guy saves girl\" story, there are some very exciting plot twists and the storyline is based on actual Cherokee mythology and uses \"The Hero's Journey,\" a writer's tool for story structure and plot. Speaking of the plot, there's a super-natural horror element that adds a considerable amount of suspense to the game. This, along with the over-the-top violence and adult language, means you probably shouldn't buy this game for impressionable children. However, all of this is not gratuitous and really adds to the impact of the title.On the Normal difficulty, health power-ups are frequent and -when you die- you're sent to an \"Indian underworld\" where you must shoot wraiths with your spirit bow, in order to replenish your health and magic energy... Certainly a refreshing twist from every game that sends you back to the beginning of the level. On the Cherokee difficulty, there are no in-game health packs, so you'll have to rely on your abilities with the spirit bow. Speaking of spirits, you're also provided with a hawk who's your \"Spirit Guide.\" The hawk will help attack enemies and, interestingly enough, translate the alien language so that you can read their computer panels and other information.One thing that other reviewers haven't mentioned so far is that there are \"puzzles\" scattered throughout the game. Without providing any spoilers, the game sometimes makes you think in order to progress any further. For the most part, these puzzles are entertaining and challenging, but aren't designed so that you must buy a \"game guide\" to solve them. Often, solving the puzzles requires use of the \"old ways\" of your Indian ancestry, items that exist in the alien environment, or just good old fashion brainpower. Another nice feature is that the game levels are not so big that you'll find yourself lost, but you may have to explore a little to figure out exactly where to go. These features add to Prey's uniqueness in that it is more of a \"thinking man's shooter\" than your standard FPS.If you're in it for the Xbox 360 achievements, this game will deliver. Each time you complete a level, you earn Gamerscore (from 25-60 points per level, which increase as you progress). It's also important to note that 250 of Prey's 1000 points are earned by playing online. There's even 3 \"secret\" achievements (you don't find out what they are until you earn them) that are quite fun to unlock. All of the achievements are obtainable by the average gamer.When it comes right down to it, Prey is a game that any FPS-fan will absolutely love for the engaging story and the unique features. In addition, novice gamers that find most FPS games too difficult should consider this the perfect entry-level title. Finally, any sci-fi fan who loved the movie \"Aliens,\" and thinks they could take on an alien invasion like Sigourney Weaver did, should pick up this title and put their money where their mouth is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2006"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tekken Tag Tournament is a compilation of ALL Tekken games, which explains the appearence of some older characters, some of which are dead.  That said, know that Tekken Tag does NOT have a storyline.  What it is, Tekken Tag, is an awesome, action-packed, hyped-up version of Tekken 3 with ALL characters from previous games and a new, unique tag system that allows for awesome tag combos and throws.Experimentation is half the fun.  You will find yourself spending more time in the Practice Mode than any other mode, learning the new tag combos. One of the more interestng aspects about it is that certain combinations are optimal.  For example, Jin and Jun Kazama are the most compatible with each other, where as Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima are NOT compatible.  You will be able to tell whether or not your characters are compatible with each other in the beginning of the match.  If your characters are immediately ready for battle and go into battle stances, they are compatible.  Sometimes, 'relative teams' (such as Nina and Anna Williams) have unique animations before a fight.  Those that are not cmpatible will most likely glare at each before the match begins (Like Heihachi and Kazuya).  This in no way means that those characters are not effective together, it simply means that there is less chance of you pulling off tag combos and throwing manuevers, given that those two characters are more suited to pair up with other fighters (and, again, they also hate each other according to story line).When you pick the correct pairing of characters, a whole new book of attacks opens up to you.  You can easily have one character set the opponent up for attack, and pressing the 'tag' button at the right time will have your partner come in and automatically finish the throwing combination or allow you to follow-up with that character's combo attack.  Experimentation is the key to discovering the optimum choices (or just buy the hint book).There is no storyline for this game.  That being so, the endings for the characters leave ALOT to be desired.  However, that is to be expected with so many characters in the game.  Also, some of the endings actually do bring closure or answer questions to the endings, origins or mysteries behind some of the major characters in the Tekken storyline (Such as Heihachi Mishima and Jin Kazama, as well as what happened to Jun Kazama).  Other than that, there is no storyline so endings really are not a big part of the game, in fact most endings are not long than 7 or 10 seconds.  That makes the Arcade mode grow quite stale, however, as with all previous Tekken games(especially Tekken 3), there are LOADS of secrets to find(there was even a nude code in the Japanese version).  Tekken Tag features ALL characters from the previous games, thankfully with the exception of Gon(The dumbest character ever, in my opinion), although they may not be playable (Dr. Boskonovitch makes an appearence in the mini-game).The bottom-line: with a new, exciting Tag format, every character from the previous games and loads of secrets to find, you will have a blast with this game.  The single player mode grows stale very quickly, however, it is the multi-player option that is the most fun.  The game is actually from 1 - 4 players!  The 4 player option makes for some really intense, action-packed games, and makes Tekken Tag Tournament the best choice if you are planning to play some party games.  Out of personal experience, just myself and one friend played well over 100 matches in one sitting, due to the addictive game play.  Great graphics and sound and all out fun make this a MUST-BUY for any PS2 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2001"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Weapon Based Fighter","reviewText":"This is my fourth game in the Soul series of weapon-based fighting games.  I own Soulblade, for the Playstation, Soul Caliburs II and III for the PS2.  And now, this game.  Soul Calibur II was released for all three of the previous generation consoles: PS2, Gamecube, and XBox.  All three versions have the same basic game mechanics, with the the players having the same moves.  However, each version has a different bonus character.  Now, for the average player, it would not be worthwhile to acquire all three versions of the game, just to be able to play all three of the bonus characters.  But, if you are a big fan like me, even minor differences between each version will prompt you to play and collect them all.I have also played Tekken 5.  However, I much prefer the Soul Calibur series due to the greater variety of moves possible with each unique weapon.  Basically, you can spend many months playing this game without getting bored.  There are so many unique moves to master for each of your characters.  And there are so many modes that you can play.  Now, to get the most out of the game, you will need to play Weapon Master Mode.  Playing throught this mode will unlock some of the game's best features.  You earn not only gold, but additional costumes, weapons, and gallery items.  You can also unlock additional modes for purchase, like the famous Battle Theatre.Battle Theatre is a CPU/AI vs. CPU/AI battle.  You're basically a spectator on this one.  Personally, Battle Theatre is very entertaining for me.  I love it.But it's not all sunny skies here.  You see, each chapter in Weapon Master Mode presents a unique challenge.  Which is all well and good, and adds a lot of strategy in addition to just fighting well.  The conditions for victory will be outlined prior to the start of the challenge.  At that point, you will have the chance to select your character and his/her weapon.  There's more needed to winning these battles than quick reflexes.  You need to use your head and plan out an effective strategy.  However, the AI that you fight against will cheat you out of your victory from time to time.  This is what some reviewers are referring to when they say the AI is \"cheap\".  I was fighting Taki, using Ivy.  The condition was that my fighter will enter the fight with full health, which will slowly diminish regardless of whether Taki hits me or not.  Meaning, my character's HP meter will automatically decrease during the match.  Which means, I would have to win quickly before my HP runs out.  Ofcourse, Taki will be attacking and doing her damage to further decrease my HP.  Well, I cornered Taki where she couldn't move.  I had Ivy kicking and hitting her repeatedly.  But guess what!  Taki's health meter refused to decrease!  I had her in a corner.  And then she lands one blow and my character lost.  Now, my fellow players, that is the AI cheating.  Basically, sometimes you get the feeling that no matter how well you play, the AI will not let you win.  Especially if it is your first attempt.One of my favorite modes is Team Battle.  In this mode, you choose a team of three players and take them through stages fighting a team created by the AI.  The last \"boss\" on the final stage will be a creature called Inferno.  Basically, Inferno will stop the battle twice.  It will then change weapons and discipline to throw you off.Are the characters level?  Meaning are they equally capable in combat.  My guess, during high level play, is that they probably are.  However, for the average player, some of the characters will be more advantageous to play.  From my experience, characters with solid, horizontal, sweeping moves have a large advantage.  They can keep the enemy from getting close, for one thing.  That's why during Weapon Master Mode, you will end up fighting against Berserker more than any other enemy.  Berserker uses a large axe, and he has a rare move that allows him to perform a very low, 360-degree horizontal sweep that can keep fighters like Talim and Taki away.  Basically, Berserker is a \"cheap\" character.  You will get sick of Berserker after a while.  But, with enough skill, you can take any character and get close to do your damage.I recommend Soul Calibur to just about any video game player.  At least give it a try.  If you're the type who like to learn and master techniques, as opposed to just mindless bashing, then this is the game for you. However, please remember what I said earlier:  The AI cheats.  Yes, the AI is very cheap and will cheat you out of a victory time and time again.  But only those who have reached a very competent level of play will notice the AI cheating.  For example, under the situation that I mentioned above, most neophyte players will not be able to back Taki into a corner and chain their attacks continuously.  However, an experienced Soul player like me can do so.  But like I said, the AI refused to allow Taki's HP to go down, regardless of what I was doing. Her health meter held steady after over ten seconds of continuous punishment.  Was it a game flaw?  I don't believe so.  I think it's just that it was only my second attempt at the challenge, and it was one of the last challenges in Weapon Master, supposedly one of the hardest.  And the AI simply would not allow me a victory, no matter how well I was playing.  Yes, that takes away from the game's scoring.  Where it not for the cheap AI, this game would have gotten a five-star rating from me.This game is easy to pick and play.  However, it will take a very long time to master the techniques. I have spent many months learning how to use Ivy, Raphael, and Nightmare in combat.  It took me a long time just to be able to \"buffer\" Ivy's command throw, Summon Suffering, in the heat of a fight.  In Soul Calibur III, I hardly ever lose with either of those three characters.  It requires commitment to learn and master some of these techniques.  I suspect that is probably why none of my middle school students play this game.  There is a lot of strategy involved if you want to play any other mode besides Arcade.  I suspect that most gamers at that age simply do not want to plan out strategies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A stellar refinement of one of video gaming's highest pinnacles","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, is truly a special game. It is one of those rare treats in an artistic medium for which the universal praise and superlatives are entirely true no matter what angle you look at it from. Very few would argue against Ocarina of Time's greatness, or its lasting impact on the industry as a whole, and the fact remains that even after all these years since its release, it still reigns supreme as the world record holder for highest rated game in history. To attempt to remake such a classic masterpiece is a very daunting task indeed, but developer Grezzo, under Nintendo's watchful eye, did just that. The question is, is the remake worthy of the original's name? In short, yes, yes it is. This, to me, is the shining example of what remakes should be, but allow me to go into greater detail to explain why I think this.Full Disclosure: The Legend of Zelda series is my favorite franchise in video games (a hobby I consider my favorite pastime). It is no stretch to say that Ocarina could very well be the greatest video game ever made thus far in the relatively young entertainment medium. The incredibly epic story of good versus evil, the compelling characters, the masterful gameplay, the beautiful art design, the iconic music, the sheer variety and amount of excellent content, the majesty and mystery of exploring the massive (at the time of its release, anyway) world of Hyrule, Ocarina had it all, and honestly, it still does. You could play this today in its original format and despite its age, you'd still get a masterpiece (as evident by its popularity on the Wii Virtual Console). I make no apologies for my belief in these statements, and I stand by them. Obviously, when considering how to rate a remake, you first have to consider the backbone of the package by analyzing the original works being remade. Ocarina 3D has one of the best games ever to work with, so no problems here. Second, you have to consider what work went into the game to qualify it as a \"remake\" AND if it benefits the original work enough to warrant a remake treatment. How does Ocarina of Time 3D fare in that regard?Back in 1998, Ocarina of Time was groundbreaking in many ways as a 3D adventure game, but one of the most striking examples of this were in its visuals. If you play the original today, you'll obviously notice Ocarina has aged pretty horribly, despite the timeless art design, gameplay, music, story, etc. Graphically, Ocarina needed a facelift, and this 3DS remake does just that masterfully. From character models/animations to structures to textures, literally everything was remade from the ground up visually. Grezzo's goal in remaking the visuals was to finally channel the exact art design that was originally conceived, seen through the original official concept/promotional art for the game. That been said, rather than being the detailed, adult graphic novel style ofTwilight Princess, OoT3D is more like a vibrant, colorful stylized comic book/anime. Is that bad? By no means! It's more a matter of taste. Personally, I think this game is absolutely gorgeous! The 3DS is essentially a portable Gamecube in terms of graphical capabilities, so imagine that kind of power channeling the original epic concept and promotional art for Ocarina and you have a pretty good idea what you're looking at here. If you don't think the difference between the original and this is much, I dare you to say so after looking at videos and screenshots of them side-by-side. Yes, in terms of visuals, Grezzo nailed it with this remake! To play Ocarina with the visuals it was always intended to have before but couldn't because of hardware limitations is reason enough alone to warrant a purchase, but that's not all Ocarina 3D has going for it visually.Another visual treatment that this remake got was one that only the 3DS could offer: 3-D (duh). In all honesty, this is one of the better examples of stereoscopic 3-D on the 3DS. I actually found myself playing the game with the 3-D slider all the way up most of the time, and viewed it as an essential aspect to the experience, something I did not expect going into it. That 3-D effect really lent this feeling of organic life to the game, and helped Hyrule truly feel like a living, breathing world. As gimmicky as that all may sound, it's very true in this game's case. Nintendo did a great job making this a showpiece for the 3DS' three-dimensional capabilities. The only problem I ever encountered in this area was image ghosting in places where there was very high contrast, but that's more of a criticism of the 3DS' screen system and not this game.Koji Kondo's work as the main composer in Ocarina of Time is unrivaled in terms of iconic, brilliant music in a game. To this day, Ocarina's music is required listening for any fan of Nintendo, Zelda, video games, you name it. That been said, they did not rock the boat when handling the soundtrack for this game. The music was remastered, but plays pretty much unaltered in any way from the original (per Kondo's request). It's fun to take in the sound/music design in this game, as the original was pretty groundbreaking in this way. For example, the Hyrule field theme would change in pace and instrumentation depending on circumstances, which is something we take for granted today, but back then it was amazing. It is still impressive today. Grezzo's treatment of the audio was extremely respectful, upgrading and refining without altering, and as a massive fan of Zelda, that is exactly what I wanted.The controls are as intuitive and satisfying as ever, and in some areas may actually be better than the good ol' N64 \"pitchfork\" set-up, which always worked so well. The lower touchscreen on the 3DS is utilized to great effect, making looking at the map, changing equipment and gear, changing the view to first-person, talking to Navi, using two of four item slots, and playing the Ocarina, all smoother and more accessible. Otherwise, the action buttons are masterfully mapped on the 3DS' button layout, no complaints there. I DID find my hand cramping after extended play due to the button placement for z-targeting and shield usage, but that's more criticism of the slick, compact 3DS itself. This3DS hand griphelped *immensely* in that way (and if you have a3DS XL, thenI highly recommend this grip). You also have the option to use the 3DS' gyroscopic capabilities to aim things like your bow that feels really good to use, but that often means losing the 3-D effect, so there is a trade-off there.To summarize, this remake is, in my opinion, the best version of one of the best video games ever made. It makes substantial upgrades to the original in its visuals, 3-D implementation, audio remastering, controls, as well as the inclusion of the Master Quest (a game that plays the same as the original, except that it is mirrored and the temples/dungeons are very different and much harder, as a challenge to Ocarina veterans). The fact that this new portable version of one of the most revered games ever channels the spirit of the original so perfectly while still feeling brand new again is pretty amazing. In my opinion, that is everything a remake should be, and is exponentially better than thehideously lazy cash grab opportunitiesthat comprise most remake/rerelease/port efforts, but in all honesty, this isn't really a \"remake.\" No, it's more of a respectful refinement. You can tell that the developers were constantly cognizant of the massive shoes of the original, and so refined all that had aged and respectfully left untouched all that makes this game so timeless, and timeless it most certainly is. It is just as good now as it was all those years ago, and is a game that would be worth buying the 3DS for alone. Yes, Ocarina of Time is indeed one of the greatest games ever made, but here's what you maybe didn't expect: Ocarina of Time 3D actually refines and revitalizes this timeless masterpiece. Buy it, save the beautiful kingdom of Hyrule once again, and become the destined Hero of Time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"goldentoaster \"goldentoaster\"","summary":"if you like fun (and you know you do), give this a try","reviewText":"Now before you dismiss this review as a cry for attention by some fanboy just because i give it a five out of five, I'd like to first say that this is only my second Final fantasy experience (the other being FFX), and I only gave it a 5/5 because I genuinely loved playing this game. I found this game quite different from final fantasy X, first of all because it is a (somewhat) tactical game. What makes this game tactical is that battles are played on a map where you move your characters around and attack with consideration of direction, range, and properties of the land that you and your target stand on.There are many classes of characters to choose from, each having their own moveset, which is aquired by wearing the appropriate gear and weapons . Abilities learned from gear and weapons can be  mastered by gaining AP (ability points) at the end of each battle. These classes and their different play styles keep gameplay fresh and interesting, which is a good thing because battling is pretty much all you will be doing. Gameplay is overall extremely satisfying for both role-playing and strategy fans alike, and is great if played for 15-20 minute bursts each time. The ease of making this a handheld game comes from the ability to save at any time. This is all great stuff and definately worth picking up if you are into this sort of stuff. And you will definately get your money's worth, because there are aroud 300 missions, and each battle will take around 20 minutes to complete. Granted, a lot of them are dispatch missions (you dont actually fight), but the time you will spend with this game is pretty impressive.That is not to say that this game is without faults. All complaints are minor, but story is sort of shallow and forgettable, but this is not such a bad thing if you only play a little at a time. Also, dealing with a law system is very annoying when some battles forbid the basic command of \"fight\". Make a wrong move and your player gets sent to jail. It is a huge annoyance and should not have been part of the game. Lastly, the menus are a little overcomplicated and  difficult, especially buying and equipping items, but once you play long enough, you'll get used to it.So this is definately a very fun game for your Gameboy advance that will keep you busy for months to come, and even though you will find some minor flaws, it is still one of the best tactical rpgs you will find, good enough in fact, to deserve a 5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2006"}

It's a mecha game (they call it a V-suit) so you get a lot of different things to operate. Big boss anime-style mecha toward the end.- decent button/stick configurations (although no exact mapping)- never had to consult the internet because of some glitch or something I was required to do that wasn't intuitive.CONS:- No save anywhere (though for the most part you will not need it)- the entire game bends on you collecting thermal energy (like collecting health packs or armor) or you die, but there is so much of it laying around that it never affects game play. There is no dire urgency to collect it much of the time. Plus, collecting 100 bits of it scattered all over the battlefield is rather annoying. Why not have the game require you to collect 1 pool of the stuff every so often.- camera isn't always cooperative. your view will occasionally go off into a place you didn't want it to.- main protagonist character acting leaves much to be desired. Plus he's a bit of a puss and never hits on any of the hot anime chicks in the cut-scenes. 10 million cut scenes and he never even gets to first base.I'm going to place the story/plot somewhere in the middle even though I didn't really get into it. They put a lot of effort into it (you can tell with all the cut-scenes) and it's a little unfair to criticize games for bad or non-stories (Doom3 didn't need one).

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A truly magical, beautifully unique entry in the legendary Zelda series","reviewText":"The Wind Waker is a very interesting game, to say the least. When in development, never had another Zelda game garnered such polarized reactions from anticipating fans with regards to their reaction to WW's artistic style. Once gamers got their hands on this gem, however, all fears of Zelda going astray and becoming childish were quickly dispelled and we were treated to one special game. You know, one could argue that The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the greatest Zelda game of all time. You could also argue that Twilight Princess is the best, most refined Zelda game of all time. I actually agree with both of these statements. Despite that, though, Wind Waker is still my personal favorite Zelda game, and one that I have an absolutely incredible amount of nostalgia for. It truly is a special game.The most noticeable and immediately striking aspect of Wind Waker is undoubtedly its graphics. Despite initial cynicism, most people came to embrace this aspect of the game and view it as one of its strongest aspects. The cel shaded graphics on display here are spectacularly vibrant, and seem to really pop off the screen as if you were actually looking through a window into a 3D space. Another great benefit of this graphical style is that it really lends itself to emotional, impactful storytelling. In fact, I find that Wind Waker's characters convey emotion and thoughts better than 95% of games released now, despite how many are using advanced technology like motion capture these days. This really adds to the impact and emotional strength of Wind Waker's already moving, epic story.The art design really compliments this cel shaded graphical style well. The places you go, the people you encounter, all of it screams classic, nostalgic Zelda while taking you to places of, well, not EXACTLY Hyrule, but sort of, that you won't expect. From going into flaming volcanoes to inside an island held entirely in a magical, vast hallowed-out tree trunk, this is one heck of a visual adventure. Sailing across a vast ocean never looked so good. The music cannot go unmentioned either. You will hear classic Legend of Zelda themes and motifs in the music, but also new music that really fits in with that classical Zelda vibe, while striking a decidedly more colorful tone on its own. The sound design is of equal caliber as well and really add to the atmosphere of every environment you visit.Seeing how this IS a Zelda game, you can pretty much guess the premise of the story. It's set in a world where the ocean covers most of the landscape, pock-marked by islands big and small. On one particular island, it is customary for boys of a certain age to dress as the legendary Hero of Time from the now-fairy-tale folklore people tell(the same story that gamers played in Ocarina of Time), in order to instill and emulate in the boy the same courage as that legendary Hero of Time. Well, it's one boy's birthday, but his wearing the Hero's tunic is more than customary, as he is about to become his own fabled hero. His sister is kidnapped by a giant, evil bird, and he goes out to save her.That's the initial premise of the story. It's not entirely derivative of the princess in distress tale we're used to, and by the end of this epic tale, Link will have joined pirates, become the next Hero approved by the Gods, go through dungeons for ancient, powerful artifacts to save the day, meet familiar characters, and have one heckuva climatic ending sequence. To think, that's just a taste of where the story will take you. I have to admit, when I first went into WW, I expected amazing gameplay, gorgeous sound and art design, and a merely decent, acceptable story, but boy was I in for a surprise! The story here is exceptionally deep, even surprisingly dark at times, and that is right up my alley. I absolutely love the story in Wind Waker, and it may very well be my favorite aspect. It definitely isn't \"kiddy\" in any sense of the word. It's as adult as any of Link's adventures have ever been. I really don't want to give away any specific details, but suffice to say I picked my jaw off the floor, and even held back a tear here and there, more than once throughout the entire tale. It's truly special.The gameplay is as you would expect from a Zelda game, meaning refined, near perfection. The basic format is here. Explore a large open world, find important areas and meet important people, go on side-quests, enter crucial temples, go through dungeons with its various clever puzzles and new gadgets imperative to succeed, and fight epic boss battles. The only thing different here is that instead of traversing dry land on epona, you traverse vast oceanic spaces on The Red King of Lions. Because the overworld is an ocean, this really does feel like the biggest Zelda game space ever, even in retrospect.Some find the sailing parts to be boring, but not me. I find them very relaxing, and enjoyable to take in the game world. Radiant sunrises, beautiful sunsets, and storms on the open seas is a sight to behold, and its scenes like this during the sailing sequences that really add to the atmotsphere of the story. There are less Temples in Wind Waker than other Zelda games, and is a bit shorter as a result. It also seems to be a bit easier than other titles in this franchise, but none of these \"issues\" lessen the value of the experience in any way. This is as good as Zelda gameplay gets. In fact, there is a substantial amount of swordplay improvement here over its predecessors, and that really adds to the feeling of being a legendary swordsman hero. Amazing stuff.I know that I'm missing some of the more minor details here, but I'm sure you get the idea. I could write twice this much, times three, about this amazing gemstone in Nintedo's gaming library. As a matter of fact, I have played this game at least once each year since I bought it (2005), and it never gets old or shows any signs of age whatsoever. It's a timeless classic and a must-play for anyone who loves Zelda adventures with fantastic stories. This game feels like a prettier, more stylistic Ocarina of Time. It has an incredibly epic story, a beautiful imagination-fueled design, and gameplay bordering on perfection. It really is that good. Buy it, sail through its majesty, and become a new hero worthy of legend!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

This is what Guitar Hero and Rock band should have been. Speaking as someone who can rock the house on guitar hero but I have never in my life tried to seriously play a real guitar I can safely say this game is AWESOME. Both my daughter and myself are complete beginners. The game walked us through tuning and playing very simple parts on two songs, scoring us along the way and unlocking additional challenges as we became familiar with playing. There are mini games that make doing basic drills fun like a duck-hunt game teaches you fret positions. During normal play if you start missing too many notes the game will scale back what it's throwing at you so you can catch up. If you're doing better it starts throwing more challenges your way. It also steps you through the process of learning the basics one step at a time.I also had a few friends come over. One is just learning to play guitar via standard lessons from my other buddy who is the guitar player for a popular local metal band. Both of them took turns and the game quickly adapted to their skill levels. They seemed most impressed with the Amp mode in the game that would let you emulate popular equipment such as various pedals, effects, amps, etc. and store them in profiles just so you could rock out freestyle. After a 3 hour play session at my place both of them have decided to pick up the game for themselves. Better yet, when they do they can bring their cables over and we can do multiplayer.Finally, a game that makes learning guitar fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"A near-hit","reviewText":"Mariokart has never changed dramatically between installments, and for good reason; the core gameplay is simply fun as it is.  Mariokart 8 follows that trend, but it does offer a much more ambitious retooling of the series than previous installments did.  The results are mixed, but the final product is the strongest Mariokart in years.The largest changes come in the form of item balancing, specifically for lead players.  In past games, racers could defend themselves with two items at once, making it almost impossible to dislodge skilled racers from first place with anything short of a blue shell.  To the annoyance of many players, the dependence of the game's balancing system on the blue shell subjected first place racers a punishing series of nearly un-blockable attacks.Mariokart 8 partly addresses this by introducing the super horn, which emits a shockwave that can destroy any incoming shells- even the blues.  It's hard to exaggerate just how gratifying it is to use the horn- I actually WANT blue shells to be fired at me when I have it just so I can destroy them.  The game seems so much fairer with its inclusion that blue shell attacks don't provoke the same irritation as in the past, even when I don't have a horn to block one with; the only problem is that it isn't a very common item.The tradeoff is that players can only hold one item at a time now- it's no longer possible to \"trail\" one item behind your kart while storing another.  This forces players to use their items much more carefully, as using an item leaves players without  a defense for large stretches of the track.  The added strategy serves the gameplay well and makes it difficult to imagine going back to the old two-item system, which seems excessive in retrospect.Unfortunately, the system has a critical flaw in that the useless coin item (which simply adds two coins to the count) is far, far too common, to the point where first place racers will regularly finish matches receiving absolutely nothing else (I regularly get 5-6 coin pickups in a row).  This leaves lead players with no items to defend themselves with most of the race, which becomes frustrating very quickly.  After being pelted by red shells one after the other with no possible defense, even an item as useless as a single banana peel will seem like a lucky break.With the right balancing, the coin could have served to add uncertainty and tension to the races; a player in first could choose to ditch their shell or banana in hopes of receiving a super horn, with the risk of receiving a coin instead potentially leaving them vulnerable until the next item block.  This strategic dilemma never comes up in the actual game because the coin is so overwhelmingly common that it's a forgone conclusion that the player will receive one every time, eliminating any desire to take risks when a defensive item is finally found.Red shells are also too common, with players in second or third often receiving a set of three.  Needless to say, this is infuriating when there are no defensive items in first place to block a single shell with, let alone three.  The dominance of shells also does a disservice to the great new items like the boomerang and piranha plant, which are seen relatively rarely in comparison.  The shells also seem too impossible to deter through sheer racing alone; in past games, taking a corner tightly or driving between obstacles could cause a red shell to crash.  This has never worked for me in MK8.It's hard to say whether the balancing is better or worse than the previous entries; there are undoubtedly large steps forward, but the poor balancing of the coins and red shells negates them.  As bad as Mariokart Wii and 7 were in regard to items, they never made 1st place players vulnerable to this extent.Aside from the rebalancing, the game also offers new anti-gravity sections which genuinely change the way racers will approach each track.  The novelty of dizzily driving upside down wears off quickly, but the true value of anti-gravity is in more flexible tracks that aren't constricted to a single plane.  Often, an anti-gravity strip will allow a player to drive on the walls in order to avoid hazards like a thwomps, oncoming trucks, or discarded bananas on the main track, and there is a joy to be had in being able to separate yourself from a congested pack of karts by driving onto a less populated surface.The stunning visuals complement the dizzying spectacle of anti-gravity courses, with richly detailed and imaginative courses that are so full of life that it's not possible to take in even half of the nuances until watching after-race replays.  The game does have dramatic aliasing, but it's hard to dwell on technical imperfections when the artistry on display is so immaculate; unlike blander offerings such as NSMBU, it's hard to imagine Nintendo putting any more work into making a better looking game.Mariokart 8 offers 32 tracks, all of which are solidly designed and enjoyable.  There are some retro track choices that seem poor considering the alternatives- Moonview Highway and Neo Bowser City are both miles better than Toad's Turnpike- but it's hard to complain with the selection.Unfortunately, even 32 tracks isn't enough to keep a player occupied long and outside of the basic GP races and time trials there really isn't much to do offline.  Battle mode bafflingly features full length tracks, pulled from the GP mode with no alterations, instead of arenas.  Players are expected to race around the track in opposite directions, firing at one another in the split second when two oncoming karts converge, but the size of the tracks makes enemy encounters infrequent and tedium of waiting an entire lap to see your enemies again makes the mode feel uncharacteristically rushed for a Nintendo title.  It can be assumed that Nintendo was pressed for time and simply tossed a makeshift battle mode together using single player courses; hopefully, a real battle mode will be added with a future update or DLC.The online mode functions smoothly and, aside from a few intermittent connection losses, is simple and quick to join into.  Unfortunately, racing with real players adds much more tension and difficulty to the already stressful coin-heavy balancing system, which may lead to many matches ending in impotent frustration.  Matches typically end up being all or nothing affairs; players will either mercilessly pummel you with shells as you desperately scramble to find a single item other than a coin, or the races will be so uneventful and easy that it's hard to forget that they aren't time trials.  It's difficult to enjoy a well balanced race with a fair amount of challenge, but they occur often enough that the online mode remains fun.Mariokart 8 has the skeletal structure of a great title in place, but there just isn't enough content for it to live up to its potential and some of what actually is there feels rushed and tacked on.  The game also continues the trend of missing the mark when it comes to items, despite a few great and much needed improvements.  With a single update, the problems with item balancing could be fixed and battle mode could go from being an unfortunate misfire to a solid competitive mode again.  Until that happens, Mariokart 8 is still a great game, but not the definitive, perfect Mariokart experience it had the potential to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great reboot of a tired series","reviewText":"The Good: Beautiful and stunning graphics and soundtrack, excellent cinematic combat, great controls and acrobatics, open world is very well designed, amazing storyThe Bad: Combat and exploration gets tedious towards the end, that damn cliffhanger endingThe Sands of Time trilogy was probably one of the best games series ever made, let alone a few diverse series, with each game completely evolving from each other. When the series started with The Sands of Time every completely freaked out on their consoles with the game's great acrobatic moves, enticing story, and beautiful graphics. The game just felt so good and played so well the controller almost melted in your hand. With the return in Warrior Within the Prince kind of went to the dark side with a grungy, heavy metal, gory sequel that was either a hate or love it type thing. I however considered that one my favorite, but fans were pleased again with Two Thrones when the Prince actually got a dark side and went back to the style of the first game. If you loved this game you should go back and play the previous trilogy because I promise you'll fall in love with it.The PoP we are playing has a completely different story, and hell the Prince isn't even a prince; he's a thief who wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time whilst running into Princess Elika. The Prince and Elika are major roles in this wonderfully made game and it all actually works. The first thing I need to explain is that the core of the gameplay is like the previous PoP games with the whole acrobatic aspect still intact. However the Prince now has a Gauntlet that he uses to help him with all of this. The controls have been simplified where everything is just one button press...yes let go of that analog stick because you just use it to point the Prince where you want to go; not guide him. He can run across walls, run up walls, swing around poles, climb on vines, shimmy across ledges etc. The game controls so incredibly well with a few minor issues you really won't hate the controls. Another major change is the game is open world so you can go anywhere you want in this humongous world.The point of the game is to stop Arihman from destroying the world with Corruption and in turn save Elika's father Ormazd. While there are over 30 areas to explore you can go to them however you want using the acrobatic moves. Yes this can get tedious after awhile because once you discover everything you'll have to backtrack to the Temple to acquire new powers. These are four powers that are activated on various colored power plates on walls and they are key to access new Fertile Grounds. Each section is a \"mini-level\" with various obstacles to cross and just before a fertile ground is a boss fight. Navigating the world can be a bit confusing in the beginning since you'll be relying on a \"compass\" that'll guide you to where you want to go depeneding on what area you selected on your map. The point of healing each area is to rid of the Corruption killing that piece of land. Of course you can't touch this corruption or you well...you don't die in this game. Elika saves you if you fall off a ledge so consider any flat ground a checkpoint.During combat you can not die either and you may think this is absurd, but it is a blessing. Trying to find Light Seeds (after you heal a ground you go back and collect these to gain new powers) can be kind of hard so you jump off a cliff to reach one and if you fail no big deal. This is better than restarting a level, but of course if it's open world you can't technically restart a level. Elika is also a big part of your acrobatics because if you can't reach a ledge you press Y when you jump and she'll give you a boost. This is also true in combat where she is basically your \"magic\" attack. Moving through the levels is fairly easy and I didn't once have to resort to a FAQ of any kind. The compass is a great way to find out where to go since it's a little light that kind of goes along a path and you can follow it. Of course find all 1001 Light Seeds isn't necessary since you'll find plenty to acquire all powers without having to hunt and search for each seed.Now when it comes to combat you're in for quite a treat since combat is very cinematic. Everything is \"one-on-one\" and each enemy has a life bar that you much deplete. You have four major attacks: Magic, Acrobatic, Grab, and Sword. You can combine any four of these to make huge combos. Of course the corruption plays a huge role, so if the enemy changes status you can only use a certain attack to break through it. While each character technically plays the same you have to use time button presses to fend off their attacks. This can make things fun and challenging at the same time. The combat is very rewarding with the dramatic sweeping camera angles and beautifully scored music. Of course after awhile it starts feeling really old, but not enough to really bore you since it always keeps you on your toes.If you want to talk about cosmetics PoP is probably one of the best looking games ever made so far. The game is just stunningly beautiful and there are high perches you can stand on and just look out to this beautiful vista that is amazingly rendered in real time. I don't know how Ubi did it but they pulled some amazing stuff to get the game to look the way it does. The soundtrack is really stunning as well (even though there's not much of it), and the voice acting is top notch and you really in love with these two characters and they struggle with the world around them and with each other. The Prince tends to be a sarcastic hot headed wanna-be hero and Elika is a confused woman/goodie two-shoes who is always putting the Prince's fire out. There are so many amazing elements to PoP you just have to play it to really know it all. With a great cliffhanger ending, a great way to control the ending, great controls, cinematic combat, and beautiful graphics you will spend a good 10 to 12 hours exploring this world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I have been a loyal Nintendo customer since the NES. I am not pleased with this console and most of the reasons why are things that Nintendo could of and should have done different/better. They promised better 3rd party support. This is worse than previous consoles, not better. Most often if you hear of a game coming to xbox or PS it will not include Wii U.Next- Old tech. This console is nowhere near a s powerful as the PS4 or XB1. It cannot handle games coming out on the other newer consoles. PS4 and XB1 games are massive and require far more horsepower than Wii U can handle. So developers have no interest in the console. It's just a fact. PS4 and XB1 blow the Wii U away in every way. Wii U should have been the console to come out in the PS3/360 era as it is on par with those consoles.Next, a very poor installment base. Again- devs have no interest in the Wii U because it isn't selling well. It costs millions to make a game nowadays and they are just not going to make a decent profit off a Wii U title. Therefore the Wii U library of games is limited and poor. XB1 and PS4 have already passed what Wii U has done in sales in the first week of release. Even the new Mario game didn't help to make console sales. What has NINTENDO  done to try to increase sales? Little. See advertisements for a Wii U or game? Me either. Even at launch they did little to sell it. Ask people what a Wii U is. They either haven't heard of it or they think it is an add on to Wii. That is pathetic. But that is Nintendo's fault. They need to get a real PR team to save this thing.I just can't recommend the Wii U to anyone right now. Compared to the price and value of the XB1 or PS4 to the already outdated Wii U, it isn't a good deal at all. This console is not looking to do well. Sales stink and with the rise of PS4 and XB1, it is CERTAIN to get worse. I don't get any pleasure in saying these things. I love Nintendo  and they have always been very family friendly and created an incredible amount of  games that I love. But where are these games? Fans say they are coming. But it looks to be too little too late. How is this for pathetic? Want to buy Call of Duty? Well don't waste your money on the Wii U version. For BLOPs 2 and Ghosts, there will be no map packs released for it.  And that is just one example of how the Wii U is treated  by developers. A serious price drop and great original titles are needed to sway the heads of gamers looking for a new console away form XB1 and PS4. I own the Wii U, XB1, and PS4. I am saying this from my experience: Wii U is in trouble and it clearly is out gunned in this generation. If you can't get a PS4 or XB1, it would recommend a PS3 or Xbox 360 over a Wii U. A new console is cheaper and has an enormous amount of games to choose from. If you do decide to get a Wii U, you will enjoy a small selection of games to choose from(and some are simply excellent!) but you risk investing into a dying console and one that gets passed time and time again on new games from other developers. I sadly say I regret buying my Wii U now. It sits collecting dust most if the time. I played it for hours when I bought MArio 3D world, but I hadn't had it on in months prior to that. If Nintendo can get it's act together and prove it is dedicated to making this console stay alive and can bring amazing games, then I can recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIYLC","reviewerName":"A. D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"Highly recommended","reviewText":"If you own a PS3, buy this game if for no other reason than to show off the graphics.  I showed this game to a friend who had never seen a PS3 before.  His reaction was priceless.  It's not just a pretty face, though.  I love the premise of Motorstorm.  You tear around Monument Valley in just about any off-road vehicle you can think of.  I would've liked to have seen more tracks (the biggest complaint everyone has about Motorstorm) but the ones that are there are great and (for the most part) follow multiple paths.  The game is tough (it is way too easy to explode), but the trick to completing it is finding the fastest line and race it every time (no matter what vehicle you're in).  I was really disappointed when I completed Motorstorm, however.  The credits roll and then... nothing.  No bonus vehicle, no extra races.  I know it's a 1st generation PS3 game, but c'mon, you gotta give me something.  I'm giving this game 5 stars just because it's an absolute blast to play.  I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time.  Some of the races are absolute chaos- you never know what you're going to see.  Your opponents will run into each other, go flying off cliffs, and explode in high fashion.  It's never scripted or staged, either.  The AI in this game races like it wants to win.  Online is tough, the gamers will run the fastest line and you'll never catch them.  It's frustrating to know that you have no chance of winning 3 seconds into a race.  Overall, it's a beautiful, challenging and slighty flawed game.  I had a smile on my face the entire time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Say That You Shock Me","reviewText":"You were always meant to do great things, but sometimes that means terrible things along the way. So it goes when you embed a golf club into a poor sap's head.I knew *BioShock* was going to be a good shooter from the get-go. Developed by folks behind the System Shock series, it crash-lands the player into a modern day Atlantis... and the middle of a civil war.Built as a capitalist utopia, the city of Rapture fell into a Darwinian dystopia. For Rapture is also the test bed for radical stem cell technology. Unregulated use devolves the inhabitants into half-mad Splicers, while armored Big Daddies escort genetic scavengers.Up front, *BioShock* isn't a revolutionary shooter. Every gameplay element has been done a dozen times before. And like all FPS titles, *BioShock* follows a predictable game path: there is one way forward, it ends at a gate, and you'll be betrayed, ambushed, captured, or lose your weapons en route. Along that route, you'll see bloody tableaus, leaping monsters, and dark corridors.Sitting in my dark office, different pieces of the game suddenly turn out to be part of a single hidden puzzle, which reassembles the story. And this is only one of a series of themes, turns and adventures which kept me playing from dusk to dawn. As derivative as the game is, the execution means *BioShock* isn't your typical trapped-in-a-maze shooter.Rapture clanks and hums with vending machines that supply health and equipment--all of which cost money to buy. And when your wallet is slim--as it will often be--players can gather components to assemble at crafting stations. Most critical, however, are the Plasmids and Gene Tonics that boost the player character's body. These systems introduce economic, mechanical, and genetic strategy, which in turn affects the player's tactics.In most shooters, the enemies beeline for the player as if they can see through walls; but in *BioShock* you can actually sneak up on enemies, or evade them altogether. Gene tonics even provide abilities such as camouflaging or backstabbing bonuses, though I was disappointed the player couldn't teleport as some NPCs can. Cameras, bots, and turrets can also be outmaneuvered, destroyed, or even hacked to join your side, while you can seduce Big Daddies into protecting you with the right plasmid. So I like the tactical options given to the player.For the most part though, the gameplay is old-school FPS. You can't lean, lie prone, pistol whip your enemies, or use alternate fire modes (though you can select different ammunition types). Monitors display still pictures instead of FMV, there's no GUI interaction with computers, and the skyboxes are limited to 2D mattes. The design scheme is further reminiscent of the darkness of *Doom 3*, but ups the shadowy ante by omitting a flashlight altogether.Like D3, the game world is a hermetically-sealed community, divided into a series of theme-levels, such as The Medical Pavilion or Fort Frolic. Though similar to Mars City in principle, Rapture doesn't feel claustrophobic or monster-populated to an annoying degree like *Doom 3*.Yet the design is even more conservative. I wondered at the absence of escalators, ladders, cables, and bridges. There are no vehicles to ride or combat; the bathyspheres act mainly as level exits. And for a submarine environment, I was surprised the game never puts the player onto the ocean floor. Indeed, we are blocked from any body of water deep enough to submerge in.Otherwise, BioShock displays more mastery in atmosphere than just about any game I've ever played, on both subtle and garish ends. To begin with, the game never breaks from the first person view until the end cinematic. The comical vending machine recordings juxtapose with period music and propaganda announcements. Realistic water leaks into the maps in a variety of forms, from drips, to steady streams, to outright waterfalls; the fire and electrical effects are mediocre, but fog and smoke effects look great. Even the footwork is good, as splicers scrape their bludgeons on the floor, and diving suit monstrosities shake the floors with their stomps.Explorers will get the biggest dose of this environment, for the developers added extensive side rooms and even whole buildings filled with loot, battles, and tableaus. Fort Frolic is a particularly artistic exploration, if also chilling. Moreover, players can backtrack to most of the levels in the game.Finally, the gradual revelation of back-story ties up the experience. Tape diaries, radio logs, and enemy chatter provide this illumination in period slang and voice inflections. Several of these logs chart the fates of denizens at various caste and class levels, and they also accompany many of the tableaus, thus functioning as subplots.However, *BioShock* strikes me as an alienating game. It teases the player through brief interactions with a cast of otherwise intriguing characters. Whenever the PC does meet up with an NPC, a barrier tends to stand in between. This alienation, in which the player can only experience other characters at arm's length, creates a psychological message that would not register in a game that simply didn't have friendly characters. But it also dampens the heroics. At one point, a villain questions why the PC is trying to save Rapture. I had to agree because the game establishes too little connection between the plight of the city and the plight of the character.In my review for *Doom 3* I wrote, \"It is awesome when it isn't repetitive.\" I gave it three stars. For all the RPG elements, *BioShock* is also a horror-survival FPS, yet the overall effect is a four-star performance. And far from repetitive, it immersed me in an obsessive weekend of gaming. That's as ringing an endorsement as I need to give.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}

Since I bought it from here I saved about $10. Its better to have a prepaid card than to pay monthly because at the end of the year you would have paid more i think. With gold you have access to facebook and twitter, netflix and lets not forget the games. You can play against your friends and you have exclusive access to new game demos first before anybody else.

It is fun and the combat is always enjoyable. When your timing is off you know it and pay for it. For Demon Souls players you know that there is something bad around the corner so things don't come as a surprise like they did in Demon. You see the hits coming you are just not good or fast enough yet to stop it. That fact makes you push forward to get better and experience more of the world...The reason this game does not get a 5 is that overall I do not enjoy it as much as I did Demon. I played Demon earlier this year and that game is outstanding even being 2 years old. If someone said that Demon was their top game in this generation I would not argue. I cannot say the same about Dark Souls. Demon just feels better as a whole. I could go into detail as to why but it would take a long time.

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"D.

Son","summary":"Opinion from a Final Fantasy VII fanatic","reviewText":"I was really wanting this game to be good. But as the delaying progressed and the comments I read in magazines about the control schemes and everything else prepared me for the worst and I'm glad it did because my expectations would've been way too high. So I went into this game thinking it was gonna suck. And it did sometimes but overall I wasn't disappointed.I think that Square Enix just lost track of what they were trying to do. Although you run around and shoot the enemy and it's not turn based it was still always meant to play like an RPG. Hit points, leveling up, buying and upgrading weapons as well as customizing them, magic and materia, it's all here. Don't jump into it thinking it's all like an FPS. I think I'd put it more in the genre of games like Zelda and Kingdom Hearts where there's free roaming combat (Just with guns as your weapons). With this in mind, the concept of the game is pretty good. It seems to me more than anything Square just didn't finish what they started and this game could've been so much better if the developers would've put more into it.Galian beast is your only limit break for most of the game, (the only other one is chaos and you don't get him till the end) and even with Chaos I thought I'd be flying around and blasting everything but much to my disappointment I still was constricted to staying on the ground.You get three basic magics that don't ever change or level up. (What happened to leveling up Materia?!) And for most situations I can just run up and blast everything in my way. No strategy. Even for most bosses. The quick menu for items was annoying since I had to scroll through every item to get to what I wanted and if I passed it accidently there was no way of going back and I'd have to scroll through everything again. The fight music was gay at the end, and I thought chaos looked cooler on the PS1 which is pretty sad.Above all Square should've kept this more like an RPG. The gameplay was extremely linear. I couldn't go back to places I'd visited. I couldn't walk around towns and talk to people or sleep at the inn or walk on a world map. Nothing. I think if Square had included these things the game would've had a lot more depth. However, I thought the story was pretty solid and I found out a lot of good stuff about a character who was and still is, pretty mysterious. The cut-scenes are good and the voice acting's decent. Even Cait Sith couldn't mess it up and that's saying a lot. I loved the graphics.[...]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2006"}

This should easily go down in the top 3 must PS3 buys.---Let's say this first, I own all the major systems.Visually - The game is ran in 720p, it's not the absolute best looking game like Uncharted 3 or Rage; but it is definitely in my top 5. Resistance has always been outstanding with it's visuals and large scenes where you just look at the TV screen and just wonder how does a developer like Insomniac get that into the game. With the huge Goliath's  hunting after you on the boat scene (around the 3-4th level I think) and all the different monsters. This game really shines when it comes to how would this be if it became real.Story - Great story, it captures you in from the get go. Although it puts you into the action right away so be prepared to fight. There are also plenty of health kits and ammo laying around so you do not run out of both. Some of the biggest issues I have with single player games is you run out of ammo very quickly, and you are left bashing or using a sub-par gun.Guns/Mechanics/Controller Settings - The guns are fabulous in this game, each one have a second power that makes the gun more powerful. The gun mechanics are fluid and extremely easy to get a hold of. The controller settings are easy in my opinion and they can always be customized in the settings menu.Fun - This game has me luring to come back to my PS3/HDTV everyday to play and beat it. I haven't had this much fun with a game in awhile. I am very hard to entertain when it comes to video games so that leaves me quite picky.Versus - Compared the game to a similar title on the 360 (Gears of War 3, which I have played and almost beaten) I think it out performs it in almost every way. In my opinion, Gears 3 is a very hyped game where Resistance 3 floats under the radar for most people. I found that the controller settings where vastly better than Gears 3 and it wasn't so hard. Gears 3 forced me to go into cover and was a pain and glitched sometimes. Resistance 3 I can just crouch next to a car for a couple seconds. Resistance 3 has a lot more 'boss' scenes as you will, so it ends up being more excited and such. I just feel as a whole that Resistance 3 brings more to the table, and has a better story all together. Again, this is in all my opinion, coming from an not biased gamer that owns both a 360 and PS3.9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000488VP","description":"If you think it's hard to flag down a cab in a big city, try driving one in Sega's zany straight-from-the-arcade port ofCrazy Taxi. If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"ATHF Fan","summary":"YOU HAVE 0NE CRAZY GAME","reviewText":"Every once in a while one of those games come along that is an instant classic, thers SONIC 2, theres DONKEY KONG COUNTRY, theres  NFL BITZ, thers SUPER MARIO BROS.

Not that I'm complaining, mind you, because I''m not. I'm quite thankful. The majority of all my DS & Gameboy Advance games are products of the company and I've loved every last one. While I hadn't played FFXII on the PS2, I was curiously drawn to this game from watching some trailers of the game. What I can tell you about it, now that I have it, is that Revenant Wings is like Heroes of Mana in alot of ways. A mission- based real time strategy RPG, if you will, that picks up right after the events of FFXII on the PS2. This story, however, is in no way related to that one. It follows Vaan, Penelo, Balthier, and Fran in a new adventure. Out of all the titles I have of Square for handhelds, this game-by far- has the most CGI FMV I've ever seen in one. The gameplay is addictive(just like FFIII & Front Mission were to me) and the game is absolutely gorgeous graphically. All in all, it is a pretty ambitious game.

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

Why you make an excellent sequel which is what you get in Mass Effect 2.  You begin the game a short two months after the original game ends on patrol with the Normandy, and presumably the rest of your faithful crew from the first game.  Sadly tragedy strikes as the Normandy is blasted to pieces and Shepard is cast out into the dark void of space.Fast forward two years later, and your new game begins.  The player can either import their hero directly over from the previous game, or start fresh.  I played through twice, and still use the import character choice.Regardless, the game is what an excellent console RPG should be.  Important decision are tossed at the player, and seemingly innocent choices can result in Paragon or Renegade results. The story is just as engaging if not more so then the first one, with Shepard battling the Collectors this time who are acting as intergalactic doormen for those mean and nasty Reapers from the first game.Shepard must recruit a crew for a mission deemed suicidal and to some it might be if wrong choices are made throughout the game.  Through all this running and gunning there is time for exploration which is much more intriguing then the previous game, research into new and advanced systems, and yes once again we have Shepard romancing his way through the crew if the player is so inclined.The climax while exciting falls just a little short but that is not at all the game, or the writer's fault.  This is just what I like to call Middle Chapter syndrome.  All questions are not answered, and loose ends are left hanging waiting for the almighty sick day; The release of Mass Effect 3 in a few short months. If you liked the first one, then you will love this one.  If you have no idea what I am talking about but you like role playing games, and sci-fi.  Give it a shot, i don't think that you will be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Too much fun, addictive, engaging... perfect","reviewText":"As an avid gamer since the year 1989, up until recent years where adult life has consumed most of my time in monotonies such as work and a home, Skyrim came unexpectedly.Skyrim is in my opinion the best game I have ever played.To begin with, the massive world you'll notice is as visceral as ever in its quasi-fantasy style. Cyrodil was mostly grass and vegetation, Skyrim has beautiful villages and sunny landscapes which contrast with harsh, hostile snow-covered mountains, violent ravines and breath-taking waterfalls. This time the land is bigger than ever, and frighteningly detailed. There were many people working on the maps in every city and it really shows. Quite honestly, you haven't seen anything like this before, not in Morrowind or Oblivion.Straight up, the fourth sequel in the Elder Scrolls series throws an enormous amount at the player and gives them so much to do, in such a way that you are rewarded for doing anything and everything. Your character progresses and advances the more you play. Dynamics are the most important part of the game. Whatever you experience, those skills will increase as you get naturally stronger, with the ability to add a \"perk\" to a skill tree once you have so many skill points. The perks can change the game and the player will enjoy picking the best ones. Levelling up can become an addiction, severing many hours with the \"just one more\" factor.There are dozens of ways to approach quests, and if you don't want to follow the main story that's OK too. Your character can level up in other ways by doing what the hell you want, whether that being a merchant who sells his own gear, or a violent thug who robs and pillages. You can sneak, assault with double handed or one handed weapons, use destruction spells, snipe with arrows, conjure up beasts to do fighting for you, poison your foes pockets... and so much more. There are also skills in smithing weapons, alchemy, alteration, and even enchanting. Put simply, you will need to kill hundreds of hours before you become anywhere near bored.Skyrim has massively improved areas which weren't perfect about Oblivion. The AI moves like an action/adventure game as opposed to an RPG. Before, enemies used to stand on the spot as you hit them. Now, they side-strafe and dash forward to attack, blocking with shields. Some even run away if they know they're going to die. They use spells intelligently and heal up as often as the player does. The random encounters are also sometimes hilarious even if you fall foul to them. Random fights, muggings and robberies can happen at any time. Walk along a mountain path and wonder as a dragon lands at your feet and toasts you. Behold as giants and mammoths come together to ward off bandits. It really does keep the game refreshing and new. I've also heard of weddings in this game which get gate-crashed.Skyrim really flooded my senses with wonder and intrigue which I really enjoyed and still continue to think about even after I completed the main quest. The game rewards the player for completing each guild and side quests. There is so much to do, with so much content it makes going back to the standard 10-hour game disappointing and flat. Warning, this game can be very addictive. The only downside I would say is the loading times which can't be helped, although they do help to relax you with a fabulous score.10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2012"}

Now imagine that the two games are combined together with even better graphics and more personalization. And imagine that multiplay is amazing. That's what you get with Dungeon SiegeThis game is amazing. It's fully customizeable. You choose your character and get to choose male/female, hair color and style, skin color, shirt and pants, and even get options like mohawks and tattoos. Your character is a farmer descended from the 10th Legion and now just trying to live a quiet life. But of course, you can't. The evil baddies come into town and it's time to hack.The interface is a cross between Diablo and Baldur's Gate, with the best of both worlds. It's fully polygonal - you can zoom in and out, spin around, change the angle, anything you wish! Your character in his (or her!) fully customized glory goes wandering around, scaring off the chickens and rabbits and little fairies that hang out innocently, while fighting off a huge range of graphically amazing monsters. There are stony gargoyles, fleshy pig-beasts, and all sorts of things in between.The buildings are multi-levelled and the game makes it easy to go from floor to floor. Sometimes the game is picky about here you click - you can try to go IN a building and end up going behind it - but you get the hang of that pretty quickly. You can sometimes try to click on an enemy to attack it and instead start meandering over to that spot of ground. Be sure to know where you click!Like Diablo, this isn't heavy in storytelling. Yes, there's a general plot, and you hit little side quests along the way. But you go a VERY VERY long way at the start of the game before you find anything town-like, so don't even bother trying to store up all the random things you find along the way. You'll run out of room long before you reach town.You meet party members and can have them join you if you wish. Each person has his or her own skillset, and your own grow over time. Keep twanging that bow, and you become an archer! Use those magic spells again, and magic becomes your speciality! You're not restricted like in other games to a certain class. In this one, every single character starts out exactly the same. What you choose to do affects how you develop.The various weapons and armor and magic items you find are quite fun and well designed. The graphics are just great. Shadows, flickering candles, fog, it's all here. True eye-candy, and if you don't have a GEforce 3 or GEforce 4 yet, it's time to buy one.Even the arrows you shoot go thudding into your enemies. Try hitting pause while one goes whistling past your head! Shoot three into that pig-creature and zoom in to see that they all hit! Shoot at that fast enemy and watch him dodge your arrows! It's just amazing.Highly Recommended and extremely addictive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Stellar game with richly complex story, brought down by only a few, yet critical flaws","reviewText":"The graphics to Mass Effect are so utterly seamless as to almost pass for real, no matter how crazy or convoluted you make your custom character.  The graphics play like a movie, of high CG quality, and this even extends into the action.Much like Knights of the Old Republic, the game spans multiple planets, with dozens of side-quests and things to do, to upgrade your character and squadmates, and even upgrade your weapons and armor.  The action is in real-time, so it plays like an RPG and a third-person shooter.The combat is highly realistic, and taking cover is often a wise, though unlike Gears of War, not a necessary choice.Without revealing anything, the story itself is very rich, complex, and thought-provoking.  The structure of it seems to resemble The Matrix, but no worries it's much better, and not nearly as confusing or complex.Rather than easily praise every little thing, I have to point out the flaws.  They are enough, for me, to bring this flawless game down a whole star.For one, the side quests.  As has been the complaint in many negative reviews of Halo, virtually every side-quest uses the exact same four or five maps of underground complexes or research stations or mines, and the planet surfaces are exactly the same, just different colors, and rockier than the Rocky Mountains, so driving across them is HELL.Side-quests are all pretty much the same... land on some uninhabited world rockier than an asteroid, explore some anamolies (which turn out to be crashed probes or corpses to pick up for special things or side-quests involving collecting artifacts) and debris, or some other thing to check out, then go to the enemy base or outpost and kill all the baddies or do whatever to complete the mission.  Then go back to the Normandy and continue on your way.Also, the Mako.  The Mako is the ground vehicle you steal from a company and use the entire game when not on foot.  The controls are abysmal, as the forward acceleration and reverse acceleration are not set buttons, but rather are relative to which direction you're facing.  This means if you've turned yourself around and want to back out of a tight spot, you need to go FORWARD instead of BACK.  This is no big deal, but confusing, in safe situations, but when under heavy fire, it can mean the difference between escape and being pounded to dust.  It also makes strafing extremely difficult unless you have plenty of open space to go straight ahead in.  And there is almost NEVER plenty of open space to go straight through.You're guaranteed to flip the Mako over or get it stuck in virtually any and all level that they attach boosters to it which provide a very brief jump to it which works very well to get you loose.Lastly, some of the bosses, and certain spots in missions, are terribly unbalanced.  Most notably, the Matriarch Benezia.  She has with her an Asari commando team, with biotics.  Even on the easiest difficulty, with the targeting system on High, her biotic team is nearly invincible to a Soldier, as they use their biotic techniques to literally push you onto the ground for 3-5 seconds (may not seem like much, but in the heat of battle, it's fatal), and empty not only bullets but rockets at you.  And their AI is either brilliant or retarded, as they rush at you, try to stand behind your team, and directly attack you without letting you use cover, or taking any for themselves.As well as this, there is a side mission in which you must destroy assault drones.  Even on easiest difficulty, as above, when entering one of the final rooms, it is flooded with more than a dozen Rocket drones, which fire rockets straight at you and your team.  They are in a big open room.  You are entering from a hallway.  You are in the chokepoint.  You are dead.  There is no way to get around this that I have found save for sacrificing your teammates to lure them in, and exploit the chokepoint to have them stream in one by one for you to kill in the other room.Aside from those difficulties and problems, the story is absolutely solid, and completely interesting, with even more data to collect and review than even Knights of the Old Republic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2007"}

Pure Enjoyment. Pure FUN!","reviewText":"I've been playing video games for more than 20 years, and I've played all types of racing games. This is the first ATV racing game I've ever played...and it's got me HOOKED!At the start, I heard a very calming voice during the in-game tutorials. He told me that I had to complete 5 tasks before I could start out on the racing tour:(1) Complete a lap(2) Pre-load before a jump(3) Pull a jump trick(4) Use boost(5) Complete a lap in 27 seconds or lessThe on-screen instructions were very easy to follow. After I completed this task, I found myself at the main menu of options:(1) World Tour - In my quest to become #1, I would have to conquer 10 separate stages, each one more difficult than the last.(2) Single Event - This allowed me to complete in a single Race Course, Sprint Course or Freestyle Course, with adjustable difficulty levels for my computerized opponents.(3) Trial Mode - This option let me try out any completed course with no opponents. I could look for shortcuts, practice tricks, and use tutorials to get gameplay tips.(4) Online Play - I could complete with up to 15 other people to earn bragging rights!(5) Garage - Here, I could build the ATV of my dreams. The developers had variety in mind, because there were 23 different components to mix and match - according to the game description, this gives me 65,000 possible combinations to build my ATV!(6) Leaderboards - I could check either my own stats for the courses I had completed, or ranked matches I completed online.(7) Finally, the options menu. Here, I could choose sound levels, 3 different controller schemes, and an option I hadn't seen before - I could decrease the load times by installing my save data to the Playstation 3's HDD.So how is Pure different from other racing games?For starters, Disney Interactive combined several different kinds of software in its development:(1) Bink Video - A video file format that runs super-fast, uses as little memory as possible, and doesn't crash.(2) FMOD - a commercial audio library that plays music files of different formats to provide superior sound.(3) Morpheme - a game engine designed from the ground up to give animators unprecedented control over the final look of in-game animations.(4) Scaleform - a graphics engine combining development ease with the latest hardware graphics acceleration that game developers (and game PLAYERS!) demand.(5) Quazal - a company dedicated to delivering multiplayer technology to our ever-demanding video game needs.Now, all this doesn't mean a thing if the game isn't FUN. How would I describe the gameplay?BREATHTAKING.I found myself amazed at the variety Pure had to offer! No race was ever the same. My opponents took different tracks, performed different tricks, and even crashed from time to time! I created 3 ATV's - one for racing, one for freestyling, and one for sprinting. As I got better at the events, I unlocked other tracks, parts, stages, even new outfits for my riders!!! The music even had variety, with 25 different musical artists.Now, as any gamer will tell you, the biggest annoyance are loading times between stages or restarting levels. I decided to restart a race, and it took less than a second to restart.I'll repeat that so it can soak in...IT TOOK LESS THAN ONE SECOND TO RESTART A RACE.Now, Pure does have a few negatives:(1) No map screen. I'm an old fashioned gamer, and I like a map to see where turns are coming up. I can practice on an empty track, so this can be overlooked.(2) The occasional \"I'm Stuck!\" error. Sometimes the rider got caught behind a fence or a tree and the game wouldn't reset the rider back on track. There are very few of these errors, but they do happen.(3) The \"Out Of Bounds\" error. Some parts inside the course are considered out of bounds, but are not clearly marked - all it takes is one wrong jump and I went from 1st  place to 9th place.Even with these small drawbacks, I strongly recommend Pure.After all, it wasn't voted Best Racing Game of E3 2008 for nothing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"\"gamefreak0\"","summary":"Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin =FUN","reviewText":"A fun and original game that will supply fun for hours.

Then, I played GH3 at a friend's house and saw how much fun it was. So, I decided to scoop it up soon after getting my PS3.What I like:The graphics are stellar. Of course though, they should be. It's for the PS3, after all. They also seem to have captured the essence of guitar playing, without actually playing guitar. The strummer goes up and down, allowing for realistic alternate \"picking\". The notes on the screen are also seemingly consistent with where you would place your fingers on a real fretboard. Of course, there are only 5 buttons but they manage to still make it challenging enough for some serious gamers.It was nice to hear some of the bands I listen to, like Metallica, Slayer, Slipknot, Dragonforce, Killswitch Engage and Dead Kennedys. You can also customize the look of your character, as well as your on-screen guitar.What I didn't like:While the song list contained some real gems, there will be songs that you either never heard of or don't particularly care for and you will have to play some of them in career mode. It would have been nice to be able to customize the set list. Instead of having to play the songs they give you, they could have given you some more options, like remove this song from the setlist and replace it with that one. That might have been a lot of effort for the people that made the game but I figure that with all the downloadable songs availabe, they could just keep all of those songs in the game automatically and make it possible to choose from them.It seems the boss battles aren't drawing much popularity from the reviewers here and I have to go with the majority. The problem is, it's not really about skill, it's about luck. You can expect to hit the restart button many times while doing these pointless noodle contests. You can't practice the battles, only the regular songs. Also, even if you are getting good at learning the note succession, that doesn't matter because you have to attack your opponent and try and make him fail. They seem to have missed the point of guitar battles. It's supposed to be about who is more skilled, not who can make your guitar mess up. On a side note, the Tom Morello battle is just plain stupid. He's not even really playing guitar, he's just making sound effects. I know that's his style and all but they could have picked a better, more \"guitar hero\" sounding player.Overall, I'm not all that disappointed in this purchase. It's fun to play and it provides an alternative to the traditional games on most consoles. It's just that with the new generation of consoles fresh on the market, I expected it to be leaps and bounds above anything the PS2 ever had to offer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Michael Swift Ryan \"Angel\"","summary":"Full of Awe","reviewText":"Guild Wars 2 is an awesome game; And, I thoroughly love the lack of a monthly subscription fee.  Additionally, I love how the game is constantly telling us how awesome we are when we complete achievements with our avatars.  I think that the graphics utilizes much of what our computer's video graphics cards can do;  And is very stylized towards comic books and oil painting.I also enjoy the amount of patience that Arena.net's Free to Play {F2P} method rewards.  What they offer in monetary exchange is pretty neat;  But so far I see very little I want to trade actual money for.The questing in the game are extremely innovative, in my humble opinion.  Certain non-player characters {N.P.C.s} in each zone, like defense in Soccer, want protection or help with various choirs.The avatar background choices made at character creation, change the avatar's main plot/quest.  There are few choices in Guild Wars 2; But, they are very meaningful choices that drastically change the main plot for the character.I believe that offering players multiple options to explore main character and companion drama/romance story/plot arcs is profitable.  So I gave it 4/5 stars rating.  I prefer the effect on me thatStar Wars: The Old Republic,Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition,Alpha Protocol,Planescape: Torment,Mass Effect,Dungeon Siege III, and a few others has.Our avatars must 'walk' to certain exit points;  And then we have the option to step into a worm hole and re-enter the map at 'wormhole exit-points';  Because the maps are very large.  These exit-points are easily identifiable on the ingame map and the world itself.I believe anyone who is similar to me, will absolutely adore Guild Wars 2.  Anyone deciding they want to purchase the game after reading this;  Please feel free to send me a message and join the Devona's Rest server in the game, if they want to know someone who is already playing the game?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2012"}

Movie based games either turn out really good or flat out bad and usually it is the later. However after seeing the reviews for The Godfather, I decided to go pick it up. I must say I was impressed. The game allows you to free roam through NY and the landscape is quite big. Unlike GTA though, this game is more focussed on taking over the city. By doing this you must buy out rackets, raid rival families' warehouses, extort bussinesses, and destroy rival mob compounds. If you enjoyed the GTA games, I strongly recommend getting this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Not sure I \"get\" it","reviewText":"I will admit going in that I have never played Metal Gear Solid I, II, or III.  That being said, if this is the greatest one of all than I haven't been missing much.  I can't write a 15 paragraph review because honestly I only played this one for approximately 3-4 hours in total.  The things I found very irritating and soured the entire game for me:1)  The main guy moves entirely too slow.  Yes, I understand this is a \"stealthy\" game where the idea is not being noticed.  BUT.....I should be able to run when I'm getting my --- kicked.  How old is this guy exactly?  If I have been spotted and am being shot at, I want to run away.  Snake just slowly jogs all hunched over like a 75 year old.  Once the stealth is lost why do they forbid you from running?  Especially when you're being attacked by those robots in the beginning.  I mean come on man, run!2)  There are way too many types of grenades.  Normally, I enjoy a game that gives you options when it comes to weaponry, BUT.....honestly give me 3 or grenades that explode in different ways, not 35 slightly different ones that I will not use anyway.  Every two steps I was picking up a different box of grenades.3)  Switching weapons is annoying and slow.  You practically have to pause the game to change guns.  That is stupid, and it is done far better in Call of Duty Modern Warfare.  When you're on the fly in a battle you should change guns only when you're behind cover, not fully stop the game and spend 15 minutes deciding what you need.4)  The barrel.  This one takes the cake.  People keep ranting about realism with this game, yet......I found an empty barrel to hide in and walk/roll around in, and I was able to carry it with me for the rest of the game??  How exactly are you fitting that into your bag?  I found it oh so stupid that I could whip out my barrel any time I wanted to and hide from enemies.  I actually laughed and put the controller down at that point.Overall I have been spoiled by Modern Warfare, and don't tell me \"they're two totally different games.\"  I am aware of that, but does that mean I have to completely sacrifice realism and a good control scheme??  If this wins game of the year I'll be shocked.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"Probably my favorite game of all time","reviewText":"This really has to be my favorite game of all time.  I know I might sound like a fanboy but I don't care.  This game is incredible.  This is the first game that showed my what the PS3 was really capable of.  Heck, this game is the reason why I bought a ps3 in the first place.Everything about this game is amazing. Polished to perfection.The first thing you will notice is the visual quality of MGS4.  This game is still one of the best looking games out there hands down.  You literally cant tell between the cutscenes and the actual gameplay.  Its that good looking.  While I began playing I watched a cutscene.  Snake hopped out of the back of a truck and just stood there.  I was wondering why the cutscene was taking so long and why Snake was just standing there motionless.  Little did I know that I was supposed to be controlling him in this instance.  It might sound rediculous but it's true.  The game blends everything together so seamlessly that gameplay graphics are the cutscene graphics as well.The story is brilliant as well and it is told brilliantly.  There are many people that say that this is pretty much a movie.  While there is some truth to that dont let it scare you away from playing this game. Also, I cant stress this enough:  Don't expect to understand the story if you haven't played any of the other MGS games.  Newcomers will just feel confused and not know what is going on.The cutscenes are perfectly done and move the story along.  There are a lot of them but not so many that end up watching more than playing.  There is definitely a lot of action to experience in this game.The action in this game has been pretty much perfected.  In the other titles there has always been a fixed camera.  Not anymore.  You free to move it anywhere you please.  Also, gone is the frustration of only being able to go prone and standing to move around.  There is a crouching position included now.The gunplay has been refined as well.  It feels a lot more natural being able to aim over the shoulder like in other 3rd person titles.There are so many refinements in the game that I can't name them all.  Like the AI.  It is incredible to watch the enemy and friendly npcs react to different situations in an intelligent way.  They will use cover and squad tactics to stay alive.The bosses are fun as well.  They are some of the best, not only in the MGS games, but in general.As you can tell, I love this game.  It so engrossing and fun that its hard to put down once you start.  The graphics, the story, the voice acting, the gameplay, everything is done so well in this game.For those that haven't played this game, you probably haven't played much of the others.  If you haven't then definitely track them down in one of their many forms and play them. And be prepared to experience on of the coolest stories ever told in a videogame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Am I missing something?","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of Marvel vs Capcom 2 (and really hoping to grab ahold of MvC1 on a console sometime), playing Marvel vs Capcom 3 was a no-brainer for me. Since I own a Wii, the closest thing I could get to something like this was Tatsunoko vs Capcom, so when I got the opportunity to play this, I wanted to see what I was missing out on.Apparently I didn't miss out on much, because I happened to find Tatsunoko to be the better fighter.You still get a giant roster of characters, and it's really amusing to see Phoenix Wright take on the likes of Spider-Man and Hulk, but as much as I wish to say the gameplay itself was as awesome as it was in MvC2, I just feel like something's a little off. The fighting, while still chaotic, just didn't feel as beyond over-the-top and fast-paced as the previous installments. It was ONLY over-the-top and fast-paced. Plus, while the graphics look nice and crisp/colorful, nothing beats the lush 2D sprites/3D environments mixture of MvC2. On top of that, the sound effects weren't as connected to the fighting as they were before. In the previous games, I REALLY felt Hulk punching his opponent. Here, I hear a simple smack.All that really isn't to say that this game is an utter disappointment. I was still genuinely enjoying the game all the way through, up to the usual difficult final boss. Oh, and online play is definitely exciting as well. I just simply didn't enjoy it as much as the first two games in the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A Handheld Masterpiece","reviewText":"When Sony announced this title for the Vita I was both excited and worried about how my favorite franchise would fare on a handheld. Not to mention that it was being done by another company and not Naughty Dog. Well I'm glad to admit my worries were unfounded. Bend Studios took Nathan Drake and made a dare I say perfect handheld experience.The first thing to get out of the way is the controls. They are pitch perfect and you have complete control over Nathan Drake just like you would using a dual shock for the PS3. The dual analogue sticks on the Vita are small but are very responsive and you quickly adjust to them. Also the touted motion controls are mostly optional. I didn't use them that much as I am a fan of the traditional controls, but when I did try them they were responsive but a little gimmicky. The motion controls that remain even for the traditionalist like me are very fluid. You have to swipe the screen for quick time events and Boss battles along with some mini games and puzzles throughout.  The puzzles are not your large scale ones like in the original trilogy they are simpler yet happen with more frequency.  The most used one is the charcoal rubbings that you uncover by rubbing the screen to draw it. There are others like cleaning artifacts and lock picking safes. They are all pretty fun and don't feel like Bend was just forcing you to use the Vita's touch capabilities. The QTEs events especially really get your adrenaline pumping as you have to swipe the screen quickly to land a finishing punch or keep Drake's grip on a handhold before he falls. I can't stress how much I loved these QTEs and I wish Naughty Dog would add more of these to their next entry.The game play itself is classic Uncharted. You shoot bad guys and climb rocks. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Bend did add some boating sequences where you have to tap the screen to row. These are pretty much interactive cut scenes as the characters discuss their next moves.  They are a fun switch up though. Another cool part of the game is where Drake is caught in a river and you have to use the touch screen to navigate him from the rocks. This was a fun and frantic section that was a lot of fun.The graphics in the game are amazing for a handheld or even a full fledged PS3 title. The environments are detailed and are gorgeous. I was literally shocked when I first laid eyes on it. I can't believe how powerful this device is. I can't imagine what games will look like for it in a few years.The story is pretty interesting. I do warn that it does come out of the gate a little slow but when the credits roll you feel like you've experienced a great adventure. Considering this is a prequel a love interest was added in Chase. I was a little skeptical of her at first but she turned out to be a great character. She is an archeologist and can hold her own intellectually with Drake.  Yes I still prefer Elena but I really liked her relationship with Drake and would love for her to return to the series in the next entry. The acting by Nolan North is as always perfect as he really has this character down pat. Also Sully turns up halfway through the adventure and it's always nice to hear Nate and Sully banter. I won't give any specifics about the story but the Villains are well defined and a great challenge for Nate.Also it is very evident that Bend Studios are fans of the series as there are some great callbacks to the franchise and the characters relationships. At one point Chase tells Drake \"You must have been raised in the circus.\" He replies \"Oh God no I'm terrified of clowns.\" It shows the great attention to detail that they paid to the characters of the franchise and how much they love it too. These characters are the exact same ones that Naughty Dog made famous no compromises.The campaign is 34 chapters long and is a great experience. There are treasures to find and puzzles to solve that make for an interesting replay. There is no multiplayer so only buy this if you plan to replay the campaign, and if you already have the first three this one has the same replay value as any of them, which has always been very high for me. I do wish there had been a few more environments though as a large part of the game happens in the jungle. The game does remedy this past the half way point with some ruin interiors but it is not the globetrotting experience of its predecessors. Still that should be seen as a small complaint as Bend has crafted a beautiful world with this game.There are also trophies that you get along the way which can be synced with your PSN account. The only thing that I wish Bend would fix is the lack of cinematic playbacks from the main menu, and you can't check your statistics at all. I know the game tracks your stats because there are trophies that are only achieved by a certain amount of headshots or brawler kills. So I know that the Vita makes note of them I just hope they become visible to the player with a future update.Well now that I've ranted on for far too long I will give you my final thoughts. Uncharted Golden Abyss is a perfect handheld experience. Does it live up to the console trilogy? The answer is definitely yes as it fits in to the franchise flawlessly. If you have a Vita you need to buy this game. Not only does it show the graphics capabilities of the system, it is also an amazing adventure that should not be missed by any fan of the series or new comer alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}

So just take that into consideration when deciding about a purchase.I've played through several of these games (LEGO Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates, etc) and this one is hands down the best of them all.  Yes you've got to grind to unlock all the characters.  Yes you've got to backtrack into previously visited areas to get everything.  Yes you're building and destroying things.  But what sets this game apart on the PS4 is...- Graphically it's the most beautiful looking of all the LEGO games (yes, it should be!).  The cutscenes are great and witty, and the special powers of the characters are faithfully transitioned.- Gameplay-wise, as I said above, it's the same as all the other LEGO games, the \"twist\" being in this one that the various superpowers change how you can get through the levels.  I STRONGLY recommend the guide with this game if you are a completionist type, as there are places you will get plenty stuck otherwise.  Also, no slowdowns/crashes that I have experienced in over 20 hours of gameplay to this stage.Being that the only other \"kid friendly\" games at release are Angry Birds Star Wars (PLEASE, for the love of all things sacred, do not spend $50 on that!) and Knack, this is the biggest \"no brainer\" purchase if you have kids and want a PS4 game they can play.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

On the other hand, it's oft-delayed development cycle did nothing to prevent the finished product from coming across half-baked in most every other department.Interestingly, the game is set in the old West, but with a gothic twist. It seems our protagonist, the outlaw Jericho Cross, has just robbed the wrong train - instead of sacks of wealth it contains an evil vampire lord. Unwittingly unleashing said vampire from the custody of the shadowy organization known as the Darkwatch, this creature of the night proceeds to raise the dead and wreak all kinds of havoc. Sound cool? Yeah, it certainly does, but the implementation of this unique setting leaves much to be desired, and the ensuing plot makes little sense.This is exceedingly unfortunate, as the gameplay here is well worth any shooter's raised eyebrow. The production values are spot on, and the action has been polished to a blue steel sheen. Think Painkiller meets Halo and you may have some idea what to expect with this one. Blasting countless vampires and other beasties into oblivion with heavily modified old Western firepower is the highlight... and all that blasting is certainly cathartic fun. A cool arsenal and a handful of vampyric superpowers provide action that is undeniably delicious. All of this is wrapped up in tight, responsive controls and a solid frame rate despite the swarms of baddies that fill the game's small(ish) levels.On the flipside, nonsensical story notwithstanding, the game offers little in the way of variety (and what it does proffer up feels decidedly tacked on, such as one level in which you're tasked to drive a vehicle merely because that's the new trend in shooters). For instance, you'll probably find yourself choosing your favorite weapons early on and sticking to them, and the game's incessant use of Reapers, scythe-wielding undead which are not only the first enemy you encounter but easily the most overused, detract from the overall experience. On top of this, the melee attack (ala Halo) is a little too powerful, and to conserve ammo and make quicker kills you'll probably find yourself bashing enemies in the face just as often as you shoot at them.The game's single greatest offense, however, comes in terms of its length. This one can be finished with ease on the normal difficulty setting (albeit with one frustrating level near the end that tasks you with jumping through a fiery town killing flying Banshees). There is some slight replay value to be had due to a very gimmicky feature that allows you to make good or evil decisions, but it's just that - gimmicky, and really quite lifeless. The game plays out much the same in either case.That said, there's still a lot to like about Darkwatch as a first person shootist. Expect the problems, deal with them, and you'll find a slick, fairly addictive action title just beneath the surface. It just had the potential to be so much more, and it's hard not to get the distinct impression that this one was rushed out the door before it could really mature into a grade A product.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2005"}

Once you are actually playing it's fine, but getting there takes 3 minutes or more.  Just to exit takes more than a minute.  Steam lingers and is slow to \"release\" your computer from it's clutches.The game itself runs well.  The engine runs smooth even with my semi-old set-up.  The levels get tedious quickly.  Most of the game is spent running at breakneck speed trying to avoid enemies galore.  On occasion you'll puzzle out of few contrived ways to get over a wall or through a barrier. The levels were fine 5 years ago in Half Life 1, but I'm sorry to say we've seen it all before by now.I've been playing games since the first computer came out.

YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN CUT SCENES AND VERY LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY HAVING FUN. THE COMBAT IS OKAY, THE STEALTH IS JUST OKAY AT BEST.  A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME INVESTED FOR A FEW MINUTES OF \"JUST OKAY\" FUN IN RETURN OVER THE FIRST 25 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY.  THAT IS NOT WORTH IT. SORRY UBISOFT.  I LOVE YOU, BUT NOT THIS GAME. I WANTED TO LOVE THIS GAME, BUT COULDN'T.I'VE NEVER BEEN TORTURED SO BADLY PLAYING A VIDEO GAME BEFORE! Tortured with bordom, drudgery and the anticipation that the actual fun part of the game will be arriving soon, but doesn't happen for more than 30 minutes at a time.I criticizing this game for at least the first 20 hours of drudgery play. Yes drudgery play because there is no fun or any lasting fun game play during the first 20 hours, give or take a few hours. That figure can go up if you choose to read all the history lessons on every place, person, group, and go chasing drifting almanac/encyclopedia pages. \"When will the actual game begin?  When will I begin to have fun for more than one 20 minute teaser here and separated by hours upon hours of cut scenes, drudgery and long 10-30 minute traveling just to get from A to B to start a mission, ect.When will all the preliminaries and acclimations and learning missions be over with before I can actually play the game of Assassins Creed III begin?  A bigger landscape is detrimental in this case. There's plenty of needless long traveling (and you don't have a car) just to get form A to B.  These are some of the thoughts going through my head for the first appx. 20 hours of drudgery play that this game offers.  I am being very patient with this \"game\".  And I will continue to do so for a few more hours.Whoever was in charge of making this game really dropped the ball.  Where's the fun? When will the fun begin? How much will BestBuy or GameStop give me for a trade in? And what other games I would like to trade this on in for?  The whole first 20 hours is cinematic & cut-scenes and storytelling and introductions to how to play along with some missions sprinkled in between.The long travels from A to B are needless.  The long time in between missions is needless.  The \"how to\" missions are boring, e.g. hunting animals, tracking, buying stuff from stores, ect.SOMEWHERE, SOONER RATHER THAN 20+ HOURS LATER, THERE SHOULD BE A FUN GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY.  THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF VIDEO GAMES IS TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE WORLD AND HAVE FUN, SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, AND NOT TO BE TIED OF IN MONOTONY, BORDOM, DRUDGERY, AND TEDIUM, WITH OCCASIONAL TEASES OF FUN MISSIONS SPARSELY MIXED IN TO KEEP YOU JERKED ALONG. This game tortures you and is an exercise in insanity because you're hoping to get to the fun parts, BUT WHEN IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN?!!!Maybe having fun wasn't the whole purpose of this game. It was just to tell a story and give a history lesson with only a small sprinkle of fun here and there.I love UbiSoft. They make quality games. UbiSoft makes great and fun filled games like the Splinter Cell series, Ghost Recon series, Rainbow Six series, and other fun ones like Driver: San Francisco.  This is the worst game (and series), I think, Ubisoft has ever made.  I think they should drop the Assassins Creed franchise after this game and focus there time and effort on making more Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell and Ghost Recon games.Yes this \"game\" is quality in the cut scenes and history.  It's great because it tells history from an unskewed, un-propaganda-like, half-truth jingoist American perspective that someone might have received in the American history classes.DURING THE FIRST APPX. 20 HOURS, THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST BORING GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED.  SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER, I'M HOPING A FUN GAME WILL ACTUALLY COME OUT OF THIS.After playing this game for about 25 hours, I come to the conclusion that the small amount of fun to be had is not worth the exhorbident time investment so I sold this game away.The combat is good, but the stealth and character movements while on the ground aren't very good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Quoad Toad","summary":"Fun for adults too","reviewText":"\"Toy Story 3 The Video Game\" is surprisingly fun.  I tried to come into this game with an open mind, but in the back of my head I thought it wouldn't be fun.  I happily learned that I was wrong.  I have had the game for two days now and have spent about 6 hours playing it.  It's quite addicting and I have to force myself to turn it off and go to bed at night.The game starts the player off in the middle of an action sequence involving kidnapped orphans.  You have to quickly run, jump, dodge, and throw balls at various enemies and obstacles (while on a moving train) to rescue the orphans.  The controls are intuitive and the game shows the player how to do some of the moves that don't come naturally.  In other words, you don't have to slog your way through a boring tutorial, just to get to the action.  You're immediately right in the action.As others have stated, the story mode is short, but fun.  You can easily switch between Buzz, Woody, and Jessie (each of whom have different skills that you need to employ to get through various levels).  Along the way, the game provides lots of hints, so the player never gets frustrated trying to figure out what to do next.  This might annoy some of more serious players, but the hints are avoidable (and let's face it, the audience for this game isn't hard-cord gamers).I agree with other reviewers that the Toy Box mode outshines the story mode.  In the Toy Box mode you are the sheriff of a toy town.  You have to build buildings and run missions for your townspeople.  The tasks and missions are varied - such as finding a bunch of cow bells, capturing thieves, rescuing miners, and racing around on your steed.  Completing missions earns you gold, which you can use to buy more buildings and toys.  There are also tons of items to collect - from various outfits to new decorative objects to a camera (that allows you to recreate scenes and earn more gold).Just like in the story mode, the game provides the player hints if necessary so each mission can be completed without too much frustration.  This is mainly done through the optional compass.  If you turn the compass on, it will point you to where you need to go to complete the mission.  The compass is good for kids, but it's nice for adults that the compass can be turned off.Overall, I am very impressed with this game.  It is on the easier side as far as games go, so hard-core gamers will likely be disappointed.  However, it's a lot of fun for most types of gamers and people of all ages.  It's a joyful game that left me feeling happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0094MYU4M","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Completely wired and sounds amazing (compare to PX51, X41, XP400)","reviewText":"If you are looking for one of Turtle Beach's great wireless headsets for your video games (PS3/360/PC), then you want to look at any of the other models. If you are primarily a PS3 gamer, check out the PX/P series. If you're primarily a 360 gamer, check out the XP models (though most of the newer sets all seem to work on both systems, it's just that one system is the focus over the other).To avoid reading the lengthy review, here's a short review:If want the best surround sound experience possible, with the best possible sound and fully customizable presets, and don't mind being \"tethered\" with wires, this headset is what you are looking for.Highly recommended.Longer review:Unboxing:Turtle Beach does a fantastic job yet again at making you feel like you've gotten something of the highest quality. The outer sleeve tells you everything you might need to know (WIRED, PS3, 360, PC, Mac and Mobile) and looks professional. When you pull the sleeve off (I had 2 plastic stickers on the top and bottom holding the sleeve to the main box), that's where the quality really shines. The box folds open and is held closed with a magnet. You pop it open and the headset sits behind a piece of clear plastic. Below the headset is the \"Audio Control Unit\" (the brains of the headset) in it's own box. Pull the plastic out and beneath that is the accessory box and the CD sleeve with the instructions inside.The only thing I had an issue pulling out of the box easily was the console interface box. For some reason it sits in the middle of the headset plastic and is very, very firmly wedged in place.Overall the unboxing was simple, as you would expect and hope.Connecting:This thing is RIDICULOUS in how many systems you can connect it to, and I have to be honest, the cable management can be quite a pain. I will stress again that if you want the simpler solution, go for one of the wireless sets. If you, like me, want the absolute best sounding experience possible, you will make adjustments to your gaming to accommodate the XP Sevens.How you connect this to the PS3 and 360 is exactly the same. As there is NO BLUETOOTH capability, everything is controlled via wires. To connect to the PS3/360 (simultaneous connections only possible if you use a receiver or TV with optical audio pass through!), you plug the optical audio out of your chosen system into the optical audio IN on the Console Interface box. Then you plug the included (and well labeled) USB to USB Micro cable, plug the micro end into the Console Interface box and the other end into the PS3/360.Once that piece is connected, you plug the USB cable from the Audio Control Unit (ACU) into the USB port on the other side of the Console Interface box. There is also another multipin connector that comes from the ACU that must be connected to the Console Interface box (you can't plug it in wrong as it's the only connector on the box that looks like this).After that, you plug the headphone jack size connector from the Headset Breakaway cable into the ACU. Then plug the other end into the breakaway connector on the headset.If you want to be able to chat, just plug the mic into the mic jack on the headset.At this point, if you are using a PS3, you are done connecting wires and cables. If you are using a 360 and want to chat, there's one more thing to do. Find the included TalkBack cable and plug the 90 degree end into your controller and the other end into the headphone jack with the Xbox 360 controller outline on the ACU. NOW you can chat with the 360.Connecting to the PC is MUCH, MUCH simpler. Just take out the ACU, plug the USB cable into your Windows PC (or Mac) and let it load drivers. Plug the headset into the headphone on the ACU, then plug the breakaway cable into the headset and you're pretty much DONE. Chat is handled through the USB connection, so no other wires need to be run.Comparing the PS3/360 setup on the XP Seven to the wireless X41, PX51 and XP400 headsets I have, this setup is simply a bear. The thing is, it's completely worth it given the quality of the sound compared to the other headsets. If this setup sounds like a pain to you, definitely look at the wireless headsets from TB. They are much simpler to use and setup.Usage:If you have a PS3, you will need to configure your audio devices. PS3 you can find the mic setup in PS3 Settings -> Accessory Settings -> Audio Device Settings -> Input/Output Device -> Turtle Beach SEVEN CHAT. Then you need to setup the 5.1 surround in Settings -> Sound Settings -> Audio Output Settings -> Optical Digital -> Dolby Digital 5.1. You also want to configure the Multi Audio Out option so that if you are using HDMI with optical, and want audio through HDMI (say you have your PS3 connected to a receiver to watch movies with family, etc), this needs to be configured. Settings -> Sound Settings -> Audio Multi-Output.For the 360, open your Xbox Guide and head to Settings -> System Settings -> Console Settings -> Audio -> Digital Output and set this to Dolby Digital 5.1. Then head to Settings -> Preferences -> Voice -> Voice Output and set this to \"Play through headset.\"On a Windows PC/Mac, you don't need to worry about these settings.This is where the ACU comes in. Once you are ready to play a game, you have a ton of options to choose from in terms of EQ. The best part is, unlike the XP400, X41 and PX51, every preset is available at the touch of one button. No more cycling through all of the presets to find the one you want (thought PX51 is nice in that you can set your MAIN presets and not need to cycle through either).The presets for Games are (these presets match the Speaker presets, IF you are using speaker pass through on the PC/Mac):1. Flat: Hear stereo game sound without effects processing or Dolby Surround Sound.2. Bass Boost: Hear and feel the rumble of deeper bass sound effects.3. Treble Boost: Boost high frequencies for crisper sounds and greater clarity.4. Bass Boost + Treble Boost: Rumbling lows and pristine highs come through clearly.5. Stereo Expander: Stereo processing with a 3D effect that allows you to focus on subtle audio cues.6. Action Enhancer: Amplify intense sounds from weapons and explosions.7. Footstep Focus: Focus on the sound of enemy footsteps approaching.8. Superhuman Hearing: Boosts low volume sounds.For Chat presets you have:1. Flat: Straight chat with no processing.2. Chat Focus: Boosts mid-range frequencies for greater concentration on chat.3. Chat Expander: Widens the virtual sound field of chat.4. Voice Amp: Amplifies chat volume.5. Hi-Pitch Morph: Morph your voice into a high-pitch tone.6. Lo-Pitch Morph: Bring your voice to demonic depths.7. Robot: Transform your voice into a metallic sound.8. Max Chat: Combines presets in an enhanced chat packageIn terms of the descriptions of the presets, the PX51 and the XP Seven have the same presets. The difference is the audio quality itself. We'll get to that in the Sound Quality section though.Compared to the X41 and XP400, their presets are simply anemic, clocking in at only 4 presets each. Though the X41 doesn't have any chat presets.Sound Quality:This is where the XP Seven beats the other headsets to a pulp. On the X41s, the sound in the headphones are very good. It's only able to process Dolby ProLogic II though. The PX51 and XP400 are both able to process true Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The only issue here though (and this includes the X41s), is that the audio quality does suffer a little because of the wireless connection. What I find on the XP400 and PX51 is that there is a slight degradation in the in game speech. It seems there is some extra compression going on to allow the audio to be truly wireless. I don't hear this in the other game sounds or music, just in game voices. I will admit that on the PX51 the issue wasn't as pronounced and I could only hear it when I really concentrated, but it was still there. On these? There is no need to compress the audio to send via RF, so what you get is the straight digital audio in all of it's quality. This means that this headset just sounds absolutely incredible.Another place the XP Seven shines is that you are able to control individual volume on specific channels. For example, say you want more pronounced stereo audio - simply click a few buttons and turn the nob on the ACU and you can control JUST the front l/r and so on. The only thing that MIGHT be desired is the ability to control l/r audio separately for those that have worse hearing in one ear over the other. Maybe the next model will include that?The surround separation on the XP Seven out of the box is phenomenal. Playing Gears of War Judgment, you can very, very clearly hear when someone is behind you, to your right, to your left or in front of you. Sure, you can achieve this with the XP400 and PX51, but I found out of the box the surround sound adjustments were pretty spot on. With the XP400 and PX51 I needed to make some adjustments to get it \"good.\" Out of the box the XP Seven is what I would call \"great.\" The X41 is no comparison, as you don't have any control over the surround mix.The noise isolation of this set is on par with the XP400 and PX51. The X41s had a more open feel and let a lot more outside \"noise\" in. I can't tell you how many times my fiance has snuck up behind me and scared me witless. She doesn't mean to, but the sound is so well isolated in these headphones that it just happens.CHAT SOUND:In both 360 and PS3 chat, I am happy to say that the sound quality is very, very good. The others I've played with all report that the sound of my voice is as clear as can be expected. Sometimes the X41s had people complaining that I sounded \"tinny\" at times. The XP400 and PX51 sound just as good.The Chat Presets are a little helpful, but aren't something I need to enhance. Volume of chat is controlled via a dial on the ACU. On one side you control the audio in your headset, on the other side you control the audible feedback you receive from your own voice. This latter piece is the same as it was, essentially, on the PX51 and XP400, so nothing new. And for those that don't like it, I recommend you turn it up \"just\" enough to get a little feedback from your own voice, as otherwise you WILL be talking really loud to your chat partners or someone who comes into the room to talk to you.Battery-This is where this headset also stands out. Being completely wired, there are NO batteries to replace. Ever. This is great.Programmable:In another bit of \"awesome,\" the XP Seven has a fully programmable DSP, just as the PX51 and a few other headsets have before them. Programming it can be a little cumbersome, but in the programming you have the ability to control just about every aspect of the audio coming out of your headphones. It is definitely worth downloading the Turtle Beach program and documentation and reading up on it and trying it out. In this way you can configure the audio to be different for every single game. You can save presets to your computer and load them into the XP Seven at any time. You want Call of Duty to accentuate footsteps? Configure a preset for it. Want Uncharted 2 to accentuate bass and boom? Configure the preset the way you want it. The possibilities are endless, and given the community around this feature, you can also download other user's presets as well and try them out.If you take the time to learn it, I think you might find you like having this level of control.AND all this being said, I have to be honest. The presets included out of the box on the XP Seven are very, very good general presets that work on most games. So you don't HAVE to program your presets if you don't want.Mobile:One thing that the XP Seven can do is play music from your mobile device (phone, MP3 player, etc) while gaming. I tried it out and it's nice, but nothing astounding.The other thing it can do, if your phone supports it, is talk through the headset on your phone as well. Because there is no Bluetooth included, this is accomplished through a cable you must plug into the headset and your phone. Audio quality on phone calls is good, and the included phone cable as a button on it so you can pick up the phone from close to the headset. You don't have to have the phone next to you to answer it.The PX51 and XP400 really kick this in the pants simply because they are Bluetooth enabled. It is nice that Turtle Beach included it in this set though.Overall:The XP Seven, as long as you don't mind wired headphones, are nothing short of phenomenal. The sound quality is second to none (at least compared to other Turtle Beach sets). The surround sound truly feels like surround sound.If you need wireless capability, definitely look elsewhere. I can't stress this enough.Highly recommended.Pros:+Amazing sound quality+True Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound (don't think it can decode DTS-MA from movies, though I haven't tried)+Audio Presets can be set to defaults+Audio Presets changeable at touch of a single button, no cycling through+Can work with PC/Mac/PS3/360+Fully programmable DSP+Every control available from the ACU means you don't need to get up to adjust surround angles, unlike the PX51 and XP400s+Comfortable (all my other Turtle Beach sets are as well, so this isn't a unique feature)Cons:-Expensive-Wired means a tangle of wires, especially if you use PS3/360-Programming DSP requires patience, effort and readingEDIT- I experienced the same left speaker failure others have noted. I contacted Turtle Beach, sent my headset in and a few days later I had a brand new pair. I did have to pay return shipping. And for those wondering, there are differences. The cord on the headphone is different and the control module has less lights on it and feels a little sturdier. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do a side by side comparison on them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2013"}

Just to mention, it is nothing like it's namesake (The computer series).  It is basically just a hack n' slash action RPG.  Not the worst of that type of game, but it is far from the best.The gameplay is fairly basic.  You run around each map, and kill everything, using your class' skill: As a sorceress, you cast spells, as an archer you use bows, and as the dwarf you slaughter with normal attacks.  It is actually pretty hard, I died a lot, especially fighting rats in the dungeon while level 1.  It follows the grand tradition of D&D; games, in that you are basically worthless at low levels.  It is pretty well done, but there really isn't anything which makes it stand out, especially because it has almost no story.  You just sort of go on an adventure.Dark Alliance has pretty okay graphics.  The lighting effects on spells and stuff are cool, as is the water.  It just wasn't all that detailed.  Even if they were excellent, the zoomed out overhead camera makes it hard to appreciate.  Some said the death animations were great.  I didn't notice.  It also has very nice music, but it is rarely played, for some reason.All in all, Baldur's Gate is okay.  It is very short (10-15 hours), but it has good replay value.  It also has fun co-op multiplayer, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  There are lots of better games to play, but this would be good for a rental.  Just for fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2003"}

Bearing no resemblance to the series on the PC except for the name, locales and most of the third edition rules of Dungeons and Dragons, Dark Alliance may upset longtime fans at first. The story unfolds as the town of Baldur's Gate is besieged with a troublesome new thieves guild. Your character seeks to track them down to reclaim stolen gold, but soon realize there is a much bigger problem at hand. A fell shadow is falling over the land and Baldur's Gate is merely one point in a great upcoming conflict that you are now drawn into. The visuals are flat out gorgeous with environments that are both intricately detailed and quite enormous. The action is viewed from a top down perspective so you can see the entire hordes of orcs and frost giants hot on your trail as well as the witnessing the full extent of the carnage your full scale magic attacks cause. You can get a close up view of your character and other residents through story and menu screens which make you sorely wish for a way to get such a detailed view during battle.Combat is achieved through straightforward action with most all commands accessable without opening the menu screen. The action is fast and furious although you'll need to employ lots of hit and run tactics until you can find or buy better weapons and armor. Leveling up your characters is easier than tradditonal D&amp;D style games, but your limited to how much you can get built up since enemies don't regenerate and there aren't many optional sidequests. Another gripe is that it's short for an RPG (about 11 Hours) even if its main focus is action. The audio holds its own against the graphics with rich orchestral background music and sharp sound effects. The voice overs are extremely well done and help sell the dramatic story. If you simply are not a fan of action RPG's then none of this is likely to win you over and Baldur's Gate purists will have to have an open mind. For the other 90% of PlayStation 2 owners, Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance is absolutely worth checking out and a highly recommended purchase for action RPG fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Half-Life Killa: Raising the Crowbar","reviewText":"If the first person shooter genre owes existence to id Software, it owes form to Valve.Valve not only defined the modern FPS, but developed one of the biggest computer games in history. An entire lexicon of marketing arose around the phrase \"Half-Life killer\". Plenty of shooters since boast higher graphics or more realistic physics or crazier weapons. Yet none has mastered the overall excellence of *Half-Life*. Until now.To be sure, *HL* remains powerful and unique. No sequel can live up to the first love of a first title. *Half-Life 2* lives all on its own. Since I recently beat both games, the virtues of this second volume become fully apparent in comparison to the first.I had to install it first. Valve requires *HL2* players to join their online game service Steam.Steam figures into *HL2's* copy protection. It allows web customers to download Valve games, and provides multiplayer service with anti-cheat protection. Steam now provides a free HL2 Deathmatch expansion for multiplayers. Once fully installed and unlocked, *HL2* does NOT need to be logged into the Internet for play or updates (unless the player chooses to disable offline mode). I didn't experience any game lag or interference while Steam was running in the background. My firewall does not seem to interfere with game updates or offline play.Some offline players complain *Half-Life 2* lacks story. *HL2* is all about story.*HL* was about escaping a shattered research facility alive, and then stopping an inter-dimensional invasion. However creative the execution, it still amounts to escaping a maze full of monsters, death traps, and locked doors. Non-player characters were just headcrab fodder; occasionally, somebody could be recruited for unlocking doors or shooting aliens.*Half-Life 2* follows a cast of NPCs who take more involved roles in Gordon's missions and determine his course. And Gordon's course takes him into a wider variety of adventures, puzzles, and battles. There are more and deeper plot twists and far more emotional involvement. After all, Gordon is now a leader and top fighter of a rebellion against Earth's conquerors.Since *HL* games are interactive cinema, they don't have stories so much as they ARE the stories. Immersion comes being shown, not told. *HL2* drops players straight in without even a manual backstory. Players experience unbroken first person perspective-no cutscenes, no pre-or post-game movies. Even level loads merely pause the game instead of cutting away from the action.*HL2* action takes place in some of the most surreal, most inspiring level design I've ever seen. Particularly during the \"Route Kanal\" and \"Water Hazard\" chapters, the game adopts a sort of industrial-noir, like old episodes of *Doctor Who*. *HL2's* \"Ravenholm\" easily shames the entire *They Hunger* mod, while \"Nova Prospekt\" makes prison movies look comfy. The lighting, textures, and props not only look great, but boost an illusion of a real world depleted of its resources and ravaged by alien animals.Animals look better than any game outside of *Doom 3*. Id's critters are a tough act to follow, but *HL2's* humans emote far more than those of any other FPS: aside from the terrific voice acting, shoulders hunch, eyes dart, and postures stiffen and relax. Fingers and thumbs not only articulate, but pick up objects and hold them like a person would. And unlike the first game, *NPCs* can pick up and use weapons found on the street.That leads to AI. The enemy security forces, who resemble the counter-terrorist ops from Terry Gilliam's *Brazil*, tend to team up somewhat better than the original Marines. Otherwise they take cover, hurl grenades, and charge like *HL* foes. Friends now jump and climb, but tend to bunch up around Gordon. They stumble into grenades and mines, but helpfully remind Gordon to avoid the same fate.Mines can be handled with the gravity gun-a big star thanks to *HL2's* physics. Unlike *Far Cry*, objects don't slide down frictionless slopes. And unlike *Doom 3*, bodies don't spin like tops or disintegrate. Objects tumble as they fall from heights, while corpses dangle over ledges. Plastic and wooden objects float in water and will tip and sink under the player' weight. Gordon can also pick up stuff a person could pick up, like shoes and pop cans and paint canisters.This is all vital to the revised puzzle system. Players no longer backtrack around a map activating generators and pumps. Nor do they navigate immense mazes of conveyor belts and airducts. Instead, physics puzzles requiring players to knock over bridges, find batteries hidden beneath containers, and pull plugs out of wall sockets. The sequel retains jumping and grate smashing navigation puzzles. *HL2* puzzles in general consume less time but are no less devious--though I never needed cheats or strategy guides to get somewhere.Getting somewhere could be subject to stability. But the game never crashed on me. Save game and level load times never took longer than one minute and were usually shorter than most FPS titles. Audio stuttering was the worst problem, and it only happened to me in certain levels or with the AA cranked up.Nothing's perfect but Valve let me down by cutting some corners. Players can no longer hurt allies and suffer the consequences-a realistic free will aspect of prior *HL* titles. The lack of multiple paths even in outdoor levels annoyed me, and many game boundaries seemed contrived. Valve also should have made the extra effort to introduce readable text to *HL2's* computer monitors. Having a destructible environment engine seems mandatory. I also feel modern shooters should have lean and prone functions, pistol whipping, and separate grenade selection and throwing keys: I knocked *D3* for not having them and so I knock *HL2*.That knocks *HL2* down to four stars. The original was innovative and complete for it's day, while this sequel, like *D3*, feels somewhat dated and cut down. Otherwise I think a lot of the criticism levied at this game is unfair--even nonsense.After years of nonsense about *Half-Life* killers, a title arrives not to slay but to partner up. *Half-Life 2* stands elbow to elbow with its older brother: being no revolution in gaming, nor a dumbed-down dirivitive. By introducing the most extensive physics, scripts, and character modeling in any game I've played, combined with a competitive graphics engine, thicker plot, and carefully sculpted levels, *Half-Life 2* achieves visual masterpiece. The crowbar has been raised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Robert N. Kallister","summary":"Be prepared","reviewText":"The world of first-person shooting games was revolutionized in 1998 when Half-Life hit the mainstream.  Featuring a slew of smooth graphics, a huge three-dimensional environment, and an interesting arsenal of weaponry, Half-Life was bound for greatness.  Since its conception, several modifications have been created, including total game revamps like Counterstrike and Team Fortress Classic.  Now, Sierra has decided enough time has passed since their original creation, and are onto bigger and better things.I base this information from the 25-minute video shown from the debut at E3 of 2003 that showcased Half-Life 2 to the fullest.  Graphically, no other first-person shooter has ever looked so good.  The characters have \"rag doll\" physics, meaning when a body hits the ground, its arms and legs flail lifelessly.  Barrels float in the water, and splinters fly from a section of wood that is shot by bullets.  The realism is astonishing.The opening sequence features the G-man from the last title that greets you in the end to offer you a position to work for him, or to face a fate \"you have no chance of surviving.\"  The programmers inform us that the G-man has over twenty separate \"muscles\" in his face that change when he talks, or has emotional responses.The A.I. is revolutionary.  During a street combat, you find yourself being bombarded by enemy fire, while several resistance fighters alongside you are trying to fight back.  The computer-controlled characters wait for prime opportunities to move and counterattack when their opposition isn't attacking them.  A.I. of this calibre has never been seen before.In addition to the classic weapons we've seen (with updated graphics and sound effects, of course), new revolutionary ways of dispatching enemies await the classic hero Gordon Freeman.So, whenever Sierra decides to release this game (if the actual date isn't pushed back again), we'll get to see the mystic wonders of the world of Half-Life once again.  Only this time, it's personal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2004"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

The game is stil a bit &quot;talky&quot; at times. Some people might say the cinematics are too long as well. Me, I enjoyed the game. They paid more attention to detail in this game and it's those little things that make this game enjoyable.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXI6","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"I've Played Better...","reviewText":"Genji Days of the Blade was a launch title for the PS3, I was reluctant to get it when it was $69 due to my previous negative encounter with Genji: Dawn of Samurai. Its safe to say at this point I'm glad I waited and picked this up for $5 at a pawnshop.Genji Days of the Blade (Genji 2) takes place pretty much after the events of Genji 1, people who didn't play the first Genji need not worry, the events of the game are shown to you before you start playing Genji 2. Yoshitsune and Benkei both make a second appearance in this game, you also get to play as Shizuka who was previously unplayable in the first game. Also joining the cast is the god of war Buson who has decided to use the body of Genji 1's boss. Overall the characters all have some sort of negative trait to them except for Yoshitsune who can practically attack non-stop, Benkei is absolutely useless, hes much too slow to do anything except for when you have to use his special attack, he is really painfully slow, sure he has massive attack power, but what good is it when you can only get in 1-2 hits before taking a few hundred point of damage? Shizuka is a little faster at attacking the Yoshitsune, but can only string together 4 combos at a time and then slightly pauses, causing her to take lots of damage, and of course being a female character her defense is pitifully low, this wouldn't be bad if you didn't have to worry about her dying, but if even 1 character dies, its game over and you have to start from the beginning! Then there's Buson, sure he looks badass, but his move set stinks, you have to always strife to get his true move set, so he will sting together 4 attacks then you have to time his strife to do another 4 attacks, useless for some bosses as they move to fast for you to get any decent hits in. Basically what I'm getting at is even though you seem to have 4 characters, there is only 1 useful one, Yoshitsune. The other characters are just along for the ride.Now there's the story, my god, its painfully dull, bland and useless. Space Invaders has a more moving story than this game. The voice acting tries to stay true to the Japanese theme and uses people with Japanese accents, Bleh hated it, the characters feel dull and lifeless,not enough character development going on. I couldn't care less if Yoshitsune's love interest died saving his life or if it was the other way around. To sum it up, boring story, never have I cared less about a story this much....For the battle system, to some it up, You ever play Dynasty Warriors? Cause Genji 2 is a DW clone, you fight hordes of enemies and then have a boss battle, watch a few cut scenes in between the regular battles and the boss battles, rinse repeat. There is also a limited set of items adding a false difficulty to the game, then you have save points that can be within 10 minutes of each other or 1 hour within each other, that's just plain stupid, and really grinds my gears when I only want to play a 30min session, but have to go another 30-40min longer than planned because I have to find a save point. very frustrating! And now for the biggest complaint, Genji 2 employs the use of a fixed camera...a FIXED CAMERA this can make things much more harder than they need to be in this game (it seems Sony slapped on another layer of false difficulty) you might be running around like a headless chicken, only to discover your destination was just a few more feet forward, but you cant see the door because the fixed camera won't change the angle to let you see this door, also get used to being hit off screen almost all the time. Needless to say,the fixed camera should have had many more angles of the same area as it makes the bad camera angles in Devil May Cry look good. Then there's is that useless smudge on the screen known as the mini-map, it doesn't tell you where to go and doesn't display the location of an enemy very well, The game probably didn't even need the mini-map,its that useless.The only redeeming factor of this game is the graphics....erm I mean character models, in all fairness they look really good (probably the best looking characters in the PS3's first year out),but what good is that if everything else in the game is bad? Overall I cannot recommend this game. Get Ninja Gaiden Sigma instead if you want to play as an asswhuping Ninja!Pros:+Great looking Characters (possibly some of the best looking for the PS3's first year)+Good looking...box art? (probably conned a few people into thinking the game was good!)Cons:-Crappy Story-Forgettable Characters-Fixed Camera-False difficulty with the fixed camera and set amount of items-Tries to be a dynasty warriors clone-And Fails-Not worth the install on you PS3's HDD (I think its around 2GB)-Yoshitsune is the only good character whats the point of the other 3 if they all border useless (esp. Benkei)-Should have been boxed with the launch PS3's,for the outrageous $69.99 they were asking you should have got much more game, and a lot less crap.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2010"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Nier is Nierly Sublime","reviewText":"At 1up my blogs dissected & examined Nier from every angle. The fact I spent so much time discussing this game should be a testament onto itself  however it is important I put all that into one review to make it easier for you the readers.Essentially this game is a brain melter. In a ruined city Nier, a rugged looking middle aged man is wielding a lead pipe against creatures composed of jumbled floating text. These abominations are called \"shades\" and it is assumed they almost wiped humanity clean off the face of the earth. Nier is not trying to save the world. His more immediate concern is protecting his sweet daughter Yohna .Suddenly an evil talking book on the ground tempts Nier with power. \"You can't fight them all off. You know you want to defend the little one you love.\"  Any of us would bargain with the devil at this point.While wielding the pipe I could do evasive rolling, jumping, and hammer on shades with quicker yet weaker attacks or charge up more powerful yet slower swings. Pretty much Nier felt like a clunky God of war mixed with a 3D final fight. The whole motif of dear dad protecting his child in a ruined city also made me reminisce about the first Silent Hill.Then the floating book comes into play. All at once Nier is  pulverizing shades with giant fists, impaling lances, and wave shaped blasts of dark energy brought to hellish life by the arcane tome. Running back and forth I'm hurling bright red balls of power at my foes when it dawns on me now Nier is more like Smash TV, Death Smiles, and Bayonetta. It was at this decisive moment I fell in love with the game. It also hurt me to admit I saw reasons why others may hate it.If you are expecting Nier to be like Final Fantasy just because square/enix is on the cover of the case you are in for a disappointment. There are no brightly colored plastic perfect young protagonists getting into ATB battles and improving their stats through an overly complex skill board. Nier himself is a gruff older man with plenty of scars, muscles, and white silvery hair.  His first concern is being a good father. Everything else comes second.Likewise if you are wanting Nier to be as frantic and fluid as Devil May cry 4, Bayonetta, or God of war you'll also be let down. While fighting in Nier is fun and has similarities to the action game genre it is not quite as graceful or pretty. Likewise there are many nuances found in rpgs such as saving villagers, gathering supplies, hunting, fishing, and farming. While Nier is nice enough not to doom you to failure for not doing these extra activities it is still encouraged.Still here? Still intrigued? Good because a few complaints aside Nier is still enjoyable and wonderfully unique!Needless to say Nier continues to screw with you. Abruptly after your slug out in the abandoned Metropolis Nier fast forwards things 1,300 years and yet both Nier and Yonah look the same. Are they reincarnated versions of the original pair? Are they clones? Did they time travel by hitching a ride with the heroes from chrono trigger? Your guess at this point would be as valid as mine! Rest assured all this is explained but Nier refuses to give it to you all at once.By now a beautiful landscape of lush forests, plains, and a desert have completely covered the last remnants of civilized society. Only the occasional skeletal rail structure of a collapsed bridge or a run down military base with hostile robots reminds you of  the days gone by.As is the often fatal flaw of most rpgs Nier starts out a bit slow. Good old dad is the town hero & labor ox doing chores for the pretty book worm librarian who is the town over seer. Her twin sister is a bard that sometimes comes on to you in a very subtle way.Your first few tasks will be killing sheep for mutton and collecting medicinal herbs. Luckily after Yohna wanders off to find a magic flower in some abandoned ruins the pace picks up and never slows down again.It is while trying to once again rescue his daughter Nier meets Grimoire Weiss, a good intentioned floating book that is nothing like the evil one encountered in the opening tutorial. After Weiss helps Yohna Nier insists they become friends. Sadly it is at this moment Yohna has once again been contaminated by the black scrawl virus. Weiss can cure her but he needs to collect all the sacred verses to do so.As you can expect each dungeon opens up an almost schizophrenic variation of game design. There's a haunted mansion that has fixed camera angles and a light dust motif over the lens giving us the feel of survival horror. After traversing through a massive Mayan looking city with barges that travel atop of moving quick sand river canals a cute masked girl named Fyra leads you through a desert to a temple in which each room places a restriction on what abilities you can use. In a misty woodland village reflexes give way to mind games as you get entangled in a demented riddle contest & text adventure to bring people out of their comatose trances. Perhaps all these pale in comparison to the run down mountain junk yard in which you battle deranged machines, do some moving rail shoot em up action whilst riding in a mining cart, and then toss bombs into a giant mechanoid's mouth to destroy it.Along the way you will also be joined by Kaine, a foul mouthed heroic young woman partly possessed by a male shade and Emil, a kind gentle boy who undergoes drastic changes to help his friends.  The character development in Nier is very deep, genuine, and at times heart breaking.  These are wonderful people but they have too many eccentric quirks and skeletons in their closets to fit in anywhere. Only Nier seems compassionate enough to look past their faults and embrace them as members of his expanded dysfunctional family. Throughout it all Weiss wryly calls Kaine a hussy for her provocative lingerie apparel and chastises Nier for being a nave sap!  (Yet deep down we know Weiss is a complete softy!)Last but not least the music and voice acting are a tour de force. Almost every track sounds like a spiritual driven hymn or techno metal clanking love song . In addition each character sounded spot on and natural. I have not one single complaint!If someone told you Nier was a Jack of all trades but master of none it would be a valid argument. However Nier never abysmally fails at anything either.What you may love about Nier+Very orginal story line.+ Hack n slash action mixed with an rpg leveling system.+Lovable characters.+Found \"magic words\" can be mixed and matched to add new perks to weapons or Weiss's spells.+Fun boss battles that are challenging but not completely ridiculous.+Kaine is not just a marketing gimmick. Though she fights in lingerie and is questionably a hermaphrodite she has deep reasons driving her actions & for her origins.+Weiss's insults and general commentary.+Fishing, farming, and collecting are all possible past times that yield rewarding results.+Enemies are diverse. I'm not merely counting the shades because in truth there are other dangers out in the wilderness that can mess you up in a heart beat. \"Giant Boar!\" (cough)+A simple yet great motivation for the main protagonist. You really root for Nier as he tries to save his sweet sick daughter Yonah from the black scrawl virus.+Bitchin sound track & voice acting+Change of gameplay styles & perspective keeps things fresh! Have you ever suddenly been dropped into Smash TV, Raiden, Donkey Kong, Break out, or Mario Bros while playing a post apocalyptic rpg?! It's sheer brilliant!+Every town has a diverse cultural flare.+ Fyra is like a cute lil girl Pyramid Head. Awww!Why you may hate Nier-Dated visuals though not nearly as bad at the critics make them out to be. Pretty much Nier looks like Demon souls and Shadow of colossus with just a bit more zing added. Is that bad? Apparently for most it is.-Some quests can be obscure on what you have to do. For example I was sent out to kill a giant boar but the guy failed to tell me that friggin bastard is invincible!-I know how to fish but don't know where to plant my harvest.- Yonah's cooking is terrible!-If you have civilized sensibilities Kaine's barrage of profanity may offend.-Dad can do EVERYTHING except swim. He sinks like a rock!-Weiss's jaded barbs occasionally make you contemplate putting him in the fireplace as kindling!-The game doesn't explain jack to you in the beginning. As a matter of fact getting everyone's story requires you play through \"game +\" mode 3 other times. The good news is you keep your swag and get to start out at a half way point instead of at the very start.-When enemies hit you they have a tendency to send you flying like a baseball smacked out of a stadium by a pro baseball batter. Luckily once you utilize blocking, jumping, and evasive rolling it is not as much of a problem anymore.My personal score: +A for artfully awesome!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2010"}

When the designers decided to only have one save file, an auto save file, it really kills the game when you encounter a major bug. Mine happened in I believe the last chapter, after beating a battle at the beginning of the chapter. I had over 10 hours into the game.

Malone","summary":"I am now Smilebit's slave","reviewText":"I tried to like Jet Set Radio on Dreamcast. I loved the unique look, and the first few levels were tons o' fun. Then suddenly the challenge level (read: frustration level) spiked sharply and I got stuck in a certain place and gave up after trying to complete it 15 times or so. So, though I bought an Xbox several months ago, I had no intention of buying this, the sequel. If you read my other Xbox reviews, you'll see that the deciding factor that caused me to buy the console was a game called Panzer Dragoon Orta. At first I wasn't too hot on the idea, because the developer of the original Panzer Dragoon games, Team Andromeda, disbanded years ago. It was when I discovered that many former members of Team Andromeda work for the new developer, Smilebit, that I decided to get on board. Reading preview articles about PDO is how I found that Smilebit made some other games, including GunValkyrie, JSRF, and the original Jet Set Radio. The first thing I did was buy GunValkyrie. It was challenging as hell, but fun as hell to boot. I needed more Smilebit goodness, so I dug out my copy of Jet Set Radio and gave it another whirl. I started over from the beginning. I spent much more time in the tutorial than I did previously. Lo and behold, I made it through the entire game in a few nights. I loved it, and I had to have more. So I bought myself a copy of JSRF.JSRF improves upon JSR in every conceivable way. Obviously, it's graphically superior, and JSR on the Dreamcast is still nothing to sneeze at even today. The levels are much bigger, teeming with activity and street life. They're much more insane in terms of seemingly out-of-reach areas which CAN be reached, if you can figure out how to trick your way there. The most important improvement is that the frustration factor has been drastically reduced. In JSR, every level had a time limit, and marauding packs of bloodthirsty, immortal, unstoppable cops and assassins that simply would NOT give up, they stayed on top of you the whole time. It was quite a common occurence for me to run out of time or have the life beaten out of me before I could complete the level and have to start over. In JSRF, these things have been eliminated. No time limit. No roving enemies. There are a few points in the game when you have to deal with enemies, but once you've dispatched them, they're gone. To make up for the drop in frustration-challenge, they beefed up the level of skill-challenge. There are tag points in JSRF that take MUCH more effort to reach than anything in JSR. But since you have nothing keeping you from trying over and over until you finally get it, it's simply a much more fun experience. This is the sort of game that's fun the first time you play it, then when you finish it you immediately start over from the beginning to see what can do with the finely honed skills of a seasoned veteran.It's such a shame Smilebit's games are languishing down in \"low sales\" territory. They are true bastions of gameplay and challenge and they deserve attention. You don't play them for story or character development. You play them to PLAY them. My anticipation for Panzer Dragoon Orta is higher than ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2002"}

Along with that the voice acting is really cringe worthy. The sound effects are mediocre at best, for a great example when a car was driving away the engine sound didn't match that cars acceleration.Now the game boasts an ability to form your ending similar to Mass Effect series, this isn't exactly true.

The PC version of the game was fantastic and really the only downside of it was the absolute necessity to have a a close to top of the line graphics card and some PC muscle to enjoy the game error free in all it's glory.The answer came in the form of a console adaptation.  This made me highly nervous as frequently a game can be awesome on the PC, but then the transfer over makes the controls difficult to use and/or the graphics are not as sharp and clean.Bioshock put ALOT of those fears to bed.  The controls are pretty simple and easy to learn and the graphics, while maybe not quite as sharp as on my PC, are absolutely fantastic nonetheless.  The settings are rich and detailed right down to a slight shimmer from damp stones and neon lights.  The selection of weapons are nothing out of this world.  Pretty much a carbon copy of most other FPS games.  The change up is the ability to upgrade them.  The introduction of plasmids adds a little more to the typical FPS experience and they are fantastic, especially the fact that they allow you use the surroundings to take out the enemies.  Trust me, nothing warms your cockles quite like flinging the charred corpse of one bad guy in to another or setting fire to spilled oil and watching a whole group of baddies go up in flames.  It DOES have some harsh language and some rather grotesque things so if you or whoever you are buying for has objections to this........you might want to skip it.I won't go in to a huge review on plot or all the features cause alot of my fellow gamers have already pretty much hit everything.  In a snapshot, this game has alternate endings, multiple weapons and plasmids, decent length, awesome graphics, smooth gameplay, deep story, and plenty of action and engaging voice acting to engage virtually every gamer out there and without the need to check out your system specs to play it should be added to your library as soon as possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2009"}

It has an extremely intuitive cover system that, once you get used to it, you'll wonder how you survived Halo 2 without it.  And like all Rainbow Six games, it is unforgiving and demands sound tactical decisions.  No \"run and gun\" gamers allowed.  ;)  The sound effects and graphics are also both top-notch.One of the most interesting parts of this game is the use of the Live Camera.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed.

{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"This is NOT the Duke Nukem I grew up with.","reviewText":"To quote Duke Nukem from this actual game... \"FAIL TO THE KING, BABY\"Now I could nit pick about how bad this is... But I think other reviewers will get that just fine as I am not the only one that has been MAJORLY disappointed by this game. SO this will be MY personal single player experience with this... Turd of a game.Some of the Duke Nukem humor and such is there but nothing I really haven't heard before. They really should have asked Bruce Campbell for some new quotes since it looked like the writers couldn't think of much of their own.I don't know why people are complaining about graphics... Why would you only play a game for the graphics? The load times for me were around 15 to 20 seconds... So get better computers then. If sitting still for under a minute makes you fly into an uncontrollable rage fit then you need some professional help.One of the FIRST things I noticed, in comparison to the other 3D Nukem games is that there are NO SECRET AREAS or end level Nukem buttons like Duke 3D, Zero hour, and Time to Kill. This actually pissed me off the most as one of the things I liked most in the Duke Nukem games was getting to explore the levels and find hidden bad guys and secret areas and buttons that do random things and reveal special areas... It gave it this little thing that current developers seem to forget about called RE-PLAYABILITY!!!!!!... \"Unf unf unf unf Where is it!?!\" But there is none of that in this game! You can only carry TWO weapons! No jet pack! The path you take is pretty much standard SUPER LINEAR C.O.D. and Bulletstorm knockoff with bits of Prey and Half Life 2 thrown in... In fact, my friend was watching me play and kept thinking I was playing a Half Life 2 mod.There was really nothing new added in terms of bad guys or guns. The A.I.... Oh damn the A.I. is absolutely HORRIBLE! TERRIBLE! BEYOND BAD! At one point I saw some, now shirtless, pig cops and then backpedaled into a room with huge open double doors, and in the other room they just kept shooting and throwing pipe bombs at the wall. I let the game run for 30 minutes while I went off to play Duke Nukem Time to Kill on my ps1 (because I needed a healthy dose of good Duke to make up for all the bad Duke) and not a single one came into the room I was standing defenseless in the middle of. I think the developers said something along the lines of \"We want the A.I. to feel like the 90s\" In all honesty I think that was their way of saying, \"We really don't want to put too much effort into making this a good game for a historic gaming series because people will buy it just for the name alone.\"The game starts off Duke Nukem enough but then it loses it's nostalgia really quick... It was promising at the first level or two and felt like it would be an OK Duke Nukem game... So if you want to play an OK Duke Nukem game, just play though dukes Casino/Hotel level then sell the game or turn it off or return it to the place you rented it from... It felt like the developers spent more time on the first two or three levels than the rest of the entire game, and just sort of settled for whatever came along after that. If I had wanted to play around in Las Vegas and Hover Dam I would just play Fallout New Vegas instead because this game goes nowhere else! In other Nukem games you would go from Frankenstein Castle, to an alien ship in space, to the Wild West, to an urban area, to a submarine under water, to England, a duke burger, forward and backwards in time, and many other things. This game was the exact opposite and just too predictable, there was no excitement, no anticipation for what may come next.The most this got out of me was a halfhearted chuckle at a very few moments in the game. It is nothing like the Classic Duke 3D games where I would bust up laughing at something I couldn't believe they got away with showing or doing. Though I think the part I laughed the most in this game was Duke and The glory hole. When you do this part, just jump up and down to see who, namely what gender, is actually in the stall next to you!Even if this game came out 10 years ago, I would still be rather critical about it because it just doesn't feel Nukem enough. In car terms it would be like Wanting a New Ford Mustang GT and then getting a Rusty Ford Pinto instead.-No Secret areas.-limited environment interactivity after first few levels.-No good Rock and Roll level music.-Duke doesn't KICK things anymore, he now does the typical weapon butt melee thing.-A.I. that is so bad it made me twitch.-No really new content, guns, or bad guys.-Way too linear and predictable for a Duke Nukem 3D game.-For over 12 years of development how can they release an under 7 hour game?!?!?-No end level Nukem Button.-No jetpack.-No really good new \"one liners.\"-Dated Level design and graphics.-NOT ENOUGH DUKE!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

There is definitely replay value in getting through the game uses all classes or going online to join others.When I think of a game like this, it reminds me of Super Ghouls n' Ghosts where sequence was everything and there wasn't too much room for errors.Some dealbreakers for the game are the save points are very far from each other and the game colors just look washed out even when the brightness is turned up. This is not a game designed for casual gamers, it's almost like a racing simulation where the goal is to get good at the sequences, get the right kit, and get it down to a science, and getting past the level is where the satisfaction is.

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"elton dan","summary":"magnificint","reviewText":"I don't know how anyone couldn't give this game 5 stars.

{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"Short, but definitely sweet, Vanquish is an awesome game not to be missed fans of any type of shooter.","reviewText":"VANQUISH is a fantastically fun, frenetically paced third person shooter from Shinji Mikami and the same studio that brought us the equally, if not more so, fun BAYONETTA which it also draws a lot of comparisons to. Like BAYONETTA, you're able to slow time down for short periods, the controls take a little getting used to, there's a scoring system, the same type of difficulty levels and the boss battles are grand. Also like BAYONETTA, once you have truly mastered the game's controls, playing the game can become near-artiistry as you rocket-slide and flip and dodge and slow time down as you cut your opponents to shreds in a hail of bullets, lasers and rockets. But that's where the comparisons stop and VANQUISH takes on an identity of its' own. So, w/out further ado, let me get to it in my normal fashion .....THE GOOD : Straight off - VANQUISH is pure fun. The inseparable centerpieces of the game are the abilities you have to both rocket-slide around the battlefield at a breakneck pace and slow time down to a crawl via your ARS battle suit. The two extremes playing off of each other make this game fantastically fun, because the game itself barely gives you a chance to breathe. There are brief interludes between battles as you move from one area to the next, but each area is loaded with a plethora of interesting looking robots w/ one purpose in mind : destroy you and your fellow soldiers. And they are quite effective at it. On the harder settings, it becomes quite daunting and there's a sense of realism to it all due to the robots' mechanical precision. On the easier settings it's a cakewalk and you can literally play through the whole game w/out dying once. And then there's everything in between. All in all there's a good variance in the range of difficulties available to you. As well, there are also a good variety of very fun and interesting weapons available to the player and they're all available from the start. Even the DLC weapons pack, should you decide to purchase that as well, for the $1.99 it goes for (I did and I'd recommend it as the weapons are extremely powerful and fun to use) is available right from the start of the game. All in all, the combination of interesting and fun weapons, plus the abilities to both tear like a rocket around the battlefield and also slow time to a crawl make Vanquish a must-play game for anyone who likes shooters of any kind, be them FPS or TPS. But in addition to the gameplay itself, Vanquish boasts some rather stunning and impressive graphics and sounds. The graphics are some of the more impressive I've seen as of late, as they're all quite realistic and smooth and have very polished look to them. Plus the framerate never drops once (at least it never did for me) and this is no small feat considering the level of detail and the insane amount of crazy stuff happening on-screen at any given moment. Especially when time is slowed down, you can see every bullet in the air, every ripple of the concussive shockwaves from the explosions and all the intricate detail of the surrounding scenery and robotic infantry. Add to that the enveloping sound field and you really feel as if you're right in the middle of the battle. As if the intensity of the battles themselves wasn't enough! And some of them do get intense. Vanquish isn't meant to be played as a standard cover & shoot game. You're meant to be out in the open, zooming around, dodging bullets, flipping past giant robots as they take lunging swipes at you and in general, being part of the hyper-kinetic mayhem going on. Epillepsy sufferers beware! One last small item to note that I found somewhat enjoyable, was that you can actually have your character take a smoke break while in cover, and use his discarded cigarette butt as a heat-source diversionary tactic. How refreshingly un-PC and rather funny considering your character is a former college football star who smokes his way through the game! When it's all said and done, Vanquish definitely leaves you wanting more. But that, in large part, is due to the fact that Vanquish is also a regrettably short game, which brings me to.....THE BAD : No game is perfect and unfortunately, as fun and as good as Vanquish is, it also has a few flaws, though nothing that's a game breaker. As I just mentioned the most glaring of these is that the game is almost unfairly short. For something this fun, it's too bad it only lasts 6-10 hours through 5 'Acts', depending on your level of skill. I'm not sure the rationale for the game being this short, but I suspect it has to do with the high quality of the game itself (graphics, sound, detail, etc.) all being fit onto 1 disc. Regardless, it's too short but it's not entirely a bad problem to have. Some of Vanquish's other flaws were the story itself and the voice acting. The story is a flimsy cold-war, Russia vs. the USA throwback, that's paper-thin and as predictable as anything. The voice acting, while not as bad as some games I've played, also left a little to be desired. But since I don't play games for the literary value I'll leave my comments on the story and dialogue it at that. Something else I found wanting of Vanquish was the lack of a multiplayer mode. While I realize that the developers stated well in advance of the release that there would not be one and for the exact reason I suspected the game is so short, it's still a disappointment none the less. We all know that nothing beats the online multiplayer experience because playing against other humans always trumps playing against AI. And considering the enemies in Vanquish are all AI to begin with, it makes this flaw even more glaring. One final thing that I wasn't too thrilled about with this game, and I fully realize this is something just for trophy / achievement hunters like myself, is the degree of difficulty in obtaining one of the trophies, compared to all the others. While I know that sounds stupid considering some trophies / achievements are supposed to be harder than others, let me explain further. There are 50 total trophies possible in Vanquish, one of those being the Platinum. The first 48 are relatively easy to obtain, either by simply playing the game & getting them automatically or by putting a little effort into a specific few. So much so, you'll be expecting Vanquish to be a relatively easy 100% completion. Oh hell no. The 49th and final trophy requires you to beat all 6 of the 'Challenges' in the game, as Vanquish also has a Challenge mode, similar to God Of Wars' Challenge of The Gods, for example. And let me say that 'challenge' is putting it lightly. While not completely impossible, some of the challenges are so ridiculously difficult and insanely hard, it just seems unbalanced compared to all the other trophies. Be forewarned that if you're a completionist like myself, you will spend MANY, MANY hours just trying to complete some of the individual challenges, let alone all of them. To be fair, there are 2 or 3 of the 6 that are somewhat manageable and not a vexing as the rest but the others will make you want to scream, pull your hair out, punch walls and chuck your controller at your TV. I guess this is where Vanquish makes up for the shortness of the game itself.THE BOTTOM LINE : Vanquish is a fast-paced, fluid and at times hyper-kinetic game that not only boasts some fun gameplay mechanics and weapons but also some truly impressive graphics and sound and is a must-play for anyone who likes shooters of any kind. While not without its' flaws and is a little too short, nothing is significant enough to detract from the gameplay itself. It leaves the player wanting more and that's definitely the sign of a very good, if not great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}

The controls are top-notch, however.  The games are generally fun, simple and family-friendly.  True to Nintendo's vision of the system, anyone is able to just pick it up and play.  The Virtual Console has a plethora of great classic games from almost every past console (NES, SNES, Genesis, Master System, NEO-GEO, Turbografx-16, MSX), plus it's fully backwards compatible with GameCube discs and also includes its own WiiWare service for original downloadable games.  This makes its game library enormous.The cons:  It's small, humble appearance is due to the lack of horsepower under that hood.  Nintendo has stripped the console of almost every aspect that defines the current generation of gaming.  There is no HD output, which is curious since more and more people are purchasing HDTV's.  The display looks awful on an LCD screen.  The graphics are great for cartoony games, but it cannot compete with current hardcore games as it's about on-par with the prior GameCube and PlayStation 2.  Most disturbing is the severe lack of storage memory.  At 256 MB, it's simply NOT enough if you download several games or channels and also have lots of game save data.  Wii has an optional SD memory card slot, but while you can store games and files there, the Wii cannot play directly off of it, which means you have to manually move files back and forth to be able to use them.  Game-wise, all your favorite Nintendo franchises make their Wii appearance (Mario, Zelda, Metroid), but there's a horrible lack of good 3rd party games.  In fact, the Wii game library is overrun with 3rd party shovelware that's barely worth $10.  This will be a serious issue if Nintendo wants to maintain their position in the #1 spot.Wii is a good system, but if you're looking for true next-gen gaming, better go with a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2007"}

I like how it stuck to focusing on the games.  Not like Sony and Microsoft that suddenly thinks your video game console needs to play DVD's, download music into your ipod, record the recent South Park episode, wash your car, and vaccuum your floor.  Ok so I made up the last two, but I think you get the point.Quality titles are on the system.  Not many at this moment that will blow you away, but alot of fun to play.  With Nintendo coming out with the usual suspects soon aka Mario Kart, Metroid, Smash Bros, etc...  you will soon have plenty to play.  Gamers that like third party games may be a bit dissappointed with the system because they don't make many titles on the Wii.The Wiimote is the best part of the system.  I have had many problems with the newer games as they have tried to put too many things into so few buttons.  You had to at times contort your fingers into positions that it hurt after long playing periods.  With the Wiimote its almost solely motioned control.  So a sword slash is a mere flick of the wrist.  Though watch out for others when playing.  Its very easy to backhand somebody else if you get too close to them.  Playing in a large room with plenty of space to move around is suggested.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2007"}

Detailed MP review","reviewText":"Let's start off by saying this one thing - I will NOT be buying Battlefield 5 day one. DICE (EA owned company) has put out numerous patches and &#34;fixes&#34; with this game. With each 800mb-2gb patch that you download - it breaks another basic part of the game. The hit detection is horrible still (a little worse than previous BF games), the tick rate needs to be improved, and they need to do something about the gambling in this game. What is all that you ask? Read below.Tick rate - In simple terms, this is basically how the game is synced up player to player. Pings are involved (internet speeds and locations) and coding mostly. Battlefield games run at a 10 tick rate, most other games run at 60. Tick rate is a lot of the &#34;hit detection&#34; or &#34;net code issues&#34; people talk about. If tick rate for BF5 is still at 10, the hit detection issues (no matter the coding) will always exist.&#34;Gambling&#34; - No matter how good or bad you are, some scenarios in BF4 are gambles. What does this mean? Players in the server are constantly being synced with the MP experience and map, this means everyone can technically be loading these values at different rates than other people. Getting shot 1 time and dying then getting mad? On your screen all you see is one bullet hitting you for an instant kill, on their screen - they could have shot 15 bullets at you. This creates a gambling problem, the best player in the world can get steam rolled by someone who just started the game. It can be infuriating to see yourself put half a clip into someone and the bullets do not register.The tick rate and gambling both produce a somewhat horrible experience at certain times, DICE says they are working on it - but you simply have to rebuild the game from the ground up and increase the tick rate to at least 30-60 before seeing any improvements.So why the 4/5 star rating? Shouldn't this be a 1-2/5 star rating? No.The game is semi broken traditionally, but it still runs really smooth - especially on PC at 60 frames per second in 1080p or greater. A weird note is the hit detection sometimes isn't all that bad - which is weird because the tick rate is always running at 10.  But all in all, there is no game out that does it like BF4. The maps are huge, vehicles are everywhere, customization is awesome, spawn system is outstanding, commander mode is fun, squad leader is finally back, conquest 48-64 players is too much fun, and the game is just different. Just on one map I can play it so much differently from each time. Do I want to be an aggressive sniper? Shotgun explosive engineer? Medic? C4 Support? Aggressive assault? Behind enemy lines Sniper? The maps are great size, you can spend the entire game just on 1-3 flags, and not even go to the other 2-3. Level design is mostly great.Anyway,Tips for beginners on PC - getting the game properly set up1. update your nvidia/AMD drivers first and foremost2. update the game and the battlelog web browser3. Put your settings on medium - no matter your setup. I find this game runs and looks great in medium settings. High settings grants you a -20 FPS, and looks no different.4. Go into your settings, put your field of view to 85 - if you are viewing on a 22-25&#34; monitor. If you are viewing on a 27&#34;+ put the field of view at 100+.5. turn off motion blur - or put the scale all the way down6. In my eyes, you must need a 60fps experience for this game...this is key. At &#60;60 FPS, you start to notice the whole &#34;gambling&#34; and tick rate stuff a lot more than usual.7. Use a gun that feels comfortable. Do not use a gun just because of higher damage or fast rate of fire. You being comfortable = killing more.Recommended guns: ease of use -  1 being easiest-3 being hardestAssault - M416(1), AugA3 (1), Scar-H (2), F2000 (3) - use the stub grip on these - do not use heavy barrelEngineer/Carbines - ACR-W (1), SG553 (2), AK-5C (1) - these are all best being silenced or suppressed barrelLMGs - AWS (1), MG4 (1), M60(2-3), M240 (1-2) - do NOT use heavy barrel on any of these - make them way too unstablePDWs - I am not a fan of any of them really. I would chose a carbine over them mainly due to their lack of range capabilities.DMRs - Do not use a DMR, hard to control, not real sniper riflesRecon/Snipers - SRR-61 (1) best range for its class, M98B (2) second best range, M4A50 (1) use this sniper until you get the SRR-61Shotguns - 870 is my favorite, use the full choke, buckshot, and laser  for great fun. The DBV-12 is also a great semi-shotgun use same attachments.Want fast leveling?Play Operation Lockers - it's basically a gold mine for XP if you know how to play it.I think I am mostly done with this review. I know a lot about the game and all of its mechanics - just comment on my review if you have a question.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC4ZS","description":"Metroid: Other Mis a single player shooter for Wii that takes the belovedMetroidfranchise into uncharted and exciting new territory. Set between the events ofSuper MetroidandMetroid Fusion, the game features unprecedented access to the backstory, thoughts and in-game interactions of the usually closed off heroine of the series, Samus Aran. Developed jointly by Nintendo and the celebrated Japanese development studio, Team Ninja, the game also features exciting play options, including the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, pointer and sideways Wii Remote controller orientation, stunning in-game cinematics and a classic blend of Metroid action and puzzle-solving gameplay..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Derek Vazquez \"DaFynestRican\"","summary":"In love with Samus","reviewText":"Wow. That pretty much describes my Metroid: Other M experience. I came into it knowing it would be a great experience, but with no preconceived notion. I didnt expect a return to Samus' 2D roots because I knew that isn't what this was, and you shouldn't, either. I'm sure Nintendo has that one cooking. However, Nintendo's collaboration with Team Ninja has made a heart-pounding 3rd person action/adventure that fleshes out Samus' story and character, all the while reminding you that yes, she kicks ass lol. The graphical presentation here is great, to be expected since this is one of the company's pride-and-joy properties. It's complete with a typical \"metroid\" score which is fast-paced when the action gets heavy and mellow for those moody moments of solitary exploration. Maybe there have been complaints about the use of Samus' weaponry and gear haviing to be authorized before use, but is this any less believable than Samus landing on foreign planets and JUST HAPPENING to stumple on weapons and gear that are conveniently and completely compatible with her suit? :-) Don't listen to those who have a problem with this different kind of Metroid and try it for yourself. People have been skeptical at the new direction of this franchise, but if these companies don't take chances we will keep seeing rehashes of the same old games. No, this type of game isn't new, but it brings with it enough depth and Nintendo charm to warrant a purchase especially from Ninty-faithfuls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002Z7BE24","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Eat Brains in Africa!","reviewText":"Resident Evil 5 is the latest instalment of the Resident Evil series, and like it's predecessors, has you running around fighting bloodthirsty zombies who want to eat your brains, and any other juicy organs they can get their rotting teeth on.  Like it's predecessor, \"5\" continues the shift from survival horror to action horror, in which you no longer have the turning speed of a drunk hippopotamus and are no longer constrained by cameras glued to odd portions of a room by duck tape.  And where Resident Evil 4 took place in Europe, \"5\" takes place in the hot plains of Africa.  It's a definite change of pace, and to some degree the game really isn't all that scary, seeing as most of it takes place in brightly lit areas in the daytime, which sucks out a lot of the fear factor.  Add in the fact that you now have a partner with you at all times, along with enough guns and firearms to wipe out a small third world country, and it's not surprising to hear that people say RE5 has strayed too far from it's roots and has RUINED THE FRANCHISE FOREVER.However, I don't think that's entirely true.  Although the game is no longer a survival horror, it exchanges outright scares for tremendous tension.  It's not uncommon to be running around, surrounded by a dozen zombies, many of whom are carrying axes, machetes, and other sharp instruments of death.  Coupled with the fact that you take damage pretty quickly, and that you're frequently fairly low on ammo, makes for tremendous tension.  There were many times when I was literally starting to sweat, and my heart was pounding while I desperately tried to hold off some particularly powerful monsters while waiting for an elevator to arrive.  Having a partner also reduces the horror element, but again, this ties into the tension factor, as you have to keep her alive, as if either of you die, it's game over.Personally, I think there's a lot to enjoy here.  The run and gun gameplay (though this is kinda incorrect, in that you can't move while shooting) works well, and the gunplay is lots of fun, especially when using some of the more powerful weapons, such as rocket launchers, gatling guns, and grenade launchers that shoot off nitrogen rounds, which freeze enemies, allowing you to blast them into tiny, frozen chunks.  There's a huge variety of monsters out to eat your brains, ranging from your standard zombies and dogs, evil chainsaw lunatics wearing burlap sacks over their heads, to all sort of giant nasties.  There's also a lot of variety in the locations you'll visit, from abandoned shanty towns, to marshlands, to underground laboratories.  Coupled with the amazing graphics, and you've got a lot to love here.Special mention must go to your partner, newcomer Sheva.  While most AI sidekicks have the IQ of a head of lettuce, Sheva is amazingly enough, actually pretty capable of taking care of both herself and you, and more once She'll come to your aid if you're dying.  I also felt confident having her run around and gun down enemies on her own without having to worry about babysitting her, a feat virtually unheard of in video games.  However, she's not entirely perfect, because she seems to have an almost religious devotion to her pistol.  Equip her with a shotgun, machine gun, grenade launcher, and a pistol, and she'll use the pistol at every opportunity, even when facing a gigantic, multi-story monster that is clearly being unharmed from tiny pistol bullets.  If Satan himself emerged from the bowls of Hell to destroy the planet, I wouldn't be surprised to see Sheva whip out her pistol and try to kill him with it, instead of doing the sensible thing and launching a tactical nuclear strike.With regards to length, the single player campaign is just about right, and while shorter then previous entries, the game never feels too short.  And to add icing on the cake, you can also go through the entire game with a buddy in co-op mode, and I highly recommend doing this, as it makes the game much more fun and enjoyable.  Once you're done with the single player campaign, the game has a lot of replay value, with different costumes to unlock, the ability to get infinite ammo for all your weapons, the ability to play the game in black and white, and the return of the Mercenaries mini-game.  All in all, there's a lot to keep you occupied, and coupled with the already fun campaign, this makes Resident Evil 5 a lot of fun to play many times over.This version of the game, dubbed gold edition, features some new additional content that wasn't present in the original release of the game.  You get two mini-games, four new costumes for Chris and Sheva, a Versus mode, and new characters for the Mercenaries mini game.The biggest addition to this edition are the two new mini-adventures, \"Lost in Nightmares\" and \"Desperate Escape\".  \"Lost\" takes place before the events of the main game, and feature Chris and Jill Valentine sneaking around a creepy mansion while avoiding large, powerful creatures who want to kill them.  It's a throwback to the classic RE survival Horror structure, as the atmosphere is dark and creepy, and a heavier reliance on puzzle solving, rather then outright combat.  \"Desperate Escape\" takes place near the end of the main game, following two characters (I won't say who, to avoid spoiling it for those who haven't played the main game yet), as they struggle to escape from a heavily infested compound with their lives.  It won't be easy, considering that they're outnumbered almost a hundred to one.  Both adventures, while short (you can complete each one in under an hour or so), are still a lot of fun and definitely worth playing through, especially \"Escape\", as enemies swell up and explode with such frequency that it becomes downright hilarious, especially enemies who's giant backpacks swell up as well, which, while impossible, is pretty damn funny.The other big additions to the gold edition are the versus and Mercenaries reunion mini-games.  I haven't played Versus mode, so I won't comment on that, other then to say that it allows you to go head to head with other players online to try and kill each other.  Mercenaries Reunion is essentially the same as the original, complete with the same stages, only with new characters, including classic RE faces such as Rebecca and Barry (I LOVE you Barry!).  While I normally despise Mercenaries mode, here you can select any character from the start, which means you get access to some very heavy fire power, rather then a dinky pistol and average shotgun.  As a result, I actually had fun, something that I thought was impossible with the Mercenaries mode, so this addition gets a thumbs up from me.The last additions are four new costumes.  Heavy Metal and Warrior for Chris, both of which scream, \"Mad Max Cosplay\", and Fairy Tale and Business attire for Sheva.  You also get some new figurines to unlock and admire.  All in all, the new additions are a lot of fun and are definitely worth looking into.In the end, is Resident Evil 5:  Gold Edition worth it?  If you haven't played the game yet, then I would recommend getting this version, as you'll be getting a lot of goodies that you wouldn't otherwise receive.  For those who already have the main game, you can buy and download the new content from the official playstation store online, which means that you won't have to go out and buy a new disk to see all the new stuff.  So all in all, if you're a fan of the series, even if the focus on Action horror has RUINED IT FOREVER, Resident Evil 5 is definitely worth a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}
