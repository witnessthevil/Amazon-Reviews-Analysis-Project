Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good. Take Mario Kart DS, for instance...it took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. With over 30 courses drawn from every Mario Kart game -Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart DS is a game that's not to be missed. The all-star cast includes characters you all know and love like..Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Konkey Kong, Wario, Bowser,and Toad.  The game also allows up to eight players to play with only one copy. The best thing about the game is the Wi-Fi gameplay. I'm surprised with its' more ambitious gameplay. I don't have any gripes with this game in any way.I simply adored Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance. It was an absolute blast to play through. Mario Kart DS is no different. Keeping with the tried and true Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart DS will surely please Mario Kart and Racing fans alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2005"}

The gold Wii Remote Plus works exactly the same as other Wii Remote Plus devices, so the function remains the same. The only difference is the color and the Hylian crest logo on the remote, it also includes a white Wii Remote jacket. The audio CD is great too- it includes music from the Zelda Symphony Orchestra, doing full-blown orchestral renditions of well-known Zelda theme songs from previous games like Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker.

Like 2009, Or Something Like That...","reviewText":"The consistently high reviews are no joke, believe you-me.This is what the wii does right and what it keeps doing right.  Simple and approachable gaming for those who don't want the game to consume their lives.  Don't get me wrong, I love a game that demands my full attention.  I live and breathed Fallout 3 for longer than anyone should and loved it.  But sometimes I just want something fun and flawless and that's where games like this come in.  It does what it does simply, cleanly and effortlessly, with no pretension and no strings attached.  Is this game the be all and end all of visual spectacle and high art?  ...is that what you were expecting when you bought freaking LEGO-star wars?  Of course not!  It's not pushing the system to it's limits, but it's reinventing platfrom gaming in a really fun and simple way.  It's easy to pick-up, hard to put-down and back-to-basics fun.The Complete Saga is, as it's name suggests, a compilation ofLego Star WarsandLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.  Do you get what that means?  This is TWO complete games strung together on one disk.  For the price of one game.  Does the implication of that not blow your mind a little?  Please, call me when they string all three Halo's together into one experience and I'll be there in no time.  If this is your first enterprise into the world of Lego, this is the place to start!  ...except, maybe for the actual building blocks... those are pretty cool to.  Different experience all around, but still fun... I'm off topic.What these Lego games do right, what they KEEP doing right, is their commitment to atmosphere and gameplay.  The action is fun and simple and they move through all six stories with relative ease.  The little block people pantomime (with no dialogue what-so-ever, save for comedic grunts and gurlges... and R2-D2 noises) in an effective and clever sort of way.  You get enough of the story to keep you moving without ever getting bogged down.  And there's lots of little jokes and clever humor strung about (no spoilers here, enjoy for yourself!).  The color palette is bright and pleasing and the music and sound fx are pulled from the movies in effective ways.  The level designs are evocative of the movie locations with out being restricted by them; the exceptions being the obligatory vehicle levels which I always feel are a waste of time and thes are no different.  Those are few and far between, though, and in the end are only slight hiccups on the road.  The motion controls on the Wii are... well, a step down I'm afraid.  Swinging lightsabers and punching work well enough, but I found myself defaulting to the basic buttons non-the-less: they were much more reliable.A puzzle and platformer at heart, this thing is satisfying to no end.  Collecting and unlocking Lego analogs of memorable characters (DOZENS of them!) and vehicles (...a couple, anyway) is rewarding and replaying old levels (in 'free-play' mode) to piece out all the secret levels and hidden gems is worth the time it requires, both in reward and gameplay fun... so long as you like puzzles.  The real prize goes to multi-player, though; that's where the simplicity of design shows it's strength.  You move about with two characters at a time and a second person can pick up and put down a fully-funcioning side-kick at any moment (in both free play and story mode).  The game, like most on the Wii, is most rewarding and moves along the most seemless when a second person is there to back you up.  The computer AI is sturdy enough and will help you out with the puzzles that require multiple people without fail.  But it, of course, pales in comparison to playing alongside a live person whom you can laugh with and yell at (depending on how things are going).Is it overly simplistic?  Kinda.  Are the controls flawed at times?  You bet!  Will you die hundreds of times because it can be REALLY hard to judge jumping from one platform to the next.  I'm sorry to say, but yes, yes you will.  But what it lacks in several small areas it more than makes up for with EVERYTHING ELSE: ease of overall gameplay, simplicity in story telling, humor, tone, playability and replayability.  If you like simple, fun, low-impact, low-investment games that are simply GAMES and not experiences, this the place for you.If you don't care for this type of thing, maybe you should consider a Playstation instead... just a thought.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y38","description":"super nintendo\nstarfox","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Pretty basic, but not bad","reviewText":"Starfox is an mediocre space shooter. It is not bad or anything, but it has become rather dated. The graphics were a revolution for the Super NES, as Starfox was one of the first 3D games and the first to use the Super FX chip, which boosted the processor of the Super NES and somehow upgraded the graphics to what looks like (although I am not certain) 32-bit. But in the middle of 2012 with the brand new HD Wii-u launching and jawdropping Playstation games coming out, the graphics are pretty poor. Not that I expected a game from 1993 to look good, I am just pointing that out. The actual gameplay is to pilot the Arwing around and shoot everything in your path. It is, by far, epic, but that is about all there is to the game. The plot is shallow and the game is rather short. So overall, even with epic music and shooting, Starfox did not live up to what I thought it would be. It is a rather interesting piece to my Super NES collection because of the FX chip and 3D visuals, but the actual game is kind of weak.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}

The reality of it is the game was not ready for release but they released it anyway. They've made several attempts to resolve the issue and each has failed, or have even made it worse. If the developers themselves can't fix the issues six months after the fact, they aren't getting fixed. At the very least it'll take another development cycle to fix whatever the issues are.

Simply put, you will not play a better third-party DS game that looks and sounds as gorgeous and beautiful as Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, which provides the classic Castlevania gameplay we all know and love, and features plenty of surprises, twists, and modes of play to keep you coming back to it for a very long time.  Compared to the previous Castlevania games to hit the DS, Order of Ecclesia is a little bit different.  You don't start out with your trusty whip playing as a Belmont or any other familiar face.  Instead, you play as Shanoa and are armed with the new Glyph system, which allows for some very interesting gameplay moments to be sure, granted it takes a little bit of time to get the most out of it.  To be honest, it takes a little bit of time in general to truly see the best that Order of Ecclesia has to offer.  Be warned that this is by and far the most challenging Castlevania game in a while that you'll play (and in my personal opinion, the most challenging since Circle of the Moon for the GBA).  Yes, you will die quite a bit, but if you stick with it you will find some truly rewarding moments that will have your head spinning.  From a technical standpoint, Order of Ecclesia is a gorgeous 2-D game with some brilliant animation and effects.  The voice over work is surprisingly good, and the game's music soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.  All in all, Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is a stunning achievement and one of the best portable Castlevania games you'll play, and the longer you stick with it through it's tough difficulty, the more rewarding an experience you'll gain from it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

The controls are the same. If a player has played the other version, there is no need learn new controls.Online play as of July 25, 2010When I first played the multiplayer back in November, I was hooked. Everything was going great. For the longest time, I had a 1.27 k/d ratio. Unfortunately, the cheaters, hackers, and glitches has poisoned the multiplayer experience. Now, I constantly find myself shooting players at point blank range, only to be melee attacked from across the room. Of course, that is by the infamous \"Commando\" perk. Of course, that player does not get killed. There is hardly any \"draw\" kills. The majority of the time, someone is either going to kill or be killed. Therefore, I believe the A.I. has to quickly decide, who wins in that type of situation or in a shootout. I can shoot a player with a full tri-burst from the M16A4, and no kill. I can shoot a player with a grenade launcher, and the opposing player is untouched.The death streaks are a joke. The \"painkiller\" is the biggest joke. The player is all of a sudden on PCP. Then, you have to empty a whole clip into a player, who has the \"painkiller\" death streak. Sometimes, you can be killed by this same player. That is very unfortunate. The multiplayer gives awful players too many advantages via Commando, Death Streaks, Heartbeat Sensors, and those damn shields. That, plus the other unrealistic gameplay issues, which I mentioned, and you have a totally broken multiplayer experience. Currently, I have a 1.25 k/d ratio. Lately, I have been wondering how the heck I was able to obtain that. I hope Call of Duty Black Ops corrects the mistakes of MW2, and make it more like COD4, and CODWAW. The multiplayer modes on those games are not nearly as bad as this.CampaignFor new players, the campaign is not that long, but who cares ?!The story of the game is like no other. I know this may sound clich&eacute;', but MW2 is a lot like playing in a movie. Players are able to do a few new things, such as be a gunner on a humvee, ride snow mobiles and boats.Some missions offer something new. The experience on the level \"No Russian\" is like no other COD or gaming experience. Anyhow, I must warn buyers, the stage may not be suitable for all viewers. I am not going to spoil the experience for new players.Other missions allow the player to do new tactics, such as breaching and clearing rooms. In addition, once the breaching takes place, the game goes into slo-mo. While shooting, everything is slowing flying through the air. Sometimes, it is hard to pinpoint exactly where the enemy is. Still, this new option is cool because you have time to just shoot each enemy before they try to kill a hostage. Still, a player must hurry. The slo-mo doesn't last long. Just breach and clear as fast as you can!!!! That new installment is cool.Some levels can be extremely hard, especially \"Favela\". No matter how skilled a player may think he is, he is going to get his share of deaths. I consider that good. I mean, who wants to play a game, which they can just play, without being killed? Some other surprises happen in the story, which I will not spoil.I must mention, the story is a little confusing. Still, the experience is so good, it doesn't matter. In fact, for those who have beaten it, playing it again may put the puzzle pieces together.Enemy AIThe enemies are a little more intelligent than the previous versions. They waste not time flanking and running for cover, so they can get a better shot. Not to mention, they have a ton of customizable weaponry. Once a weapon is picked up off an enemy, the player would swear he is playing online because of the customizable parts on the weapons.Spec OpsThis new mode is made up of side missions, which take place in similar levels of the campaign mode. Some are new. The stages get additionally challenging; the further along a player goes. Many missions, such as races, breaching missions, sniping missions, and bombing missions are a part of Spec Ops.Overall, this is a fun game. The single player is fun, albeit a confusing story. Not to mention, the Spec Ops mode give players a new way to challenge their skills. The multiplayer is fun. If players can get through the glitches and the cheating, it is fun. At this point, if you don't own this, I may advise waiting for Black Ops. Still, many players, old and new, will have some very frustrating moments. Due to the glitches of the multiplayer, I have to give this game a 3 1/2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2009"}

Hickman \"anomaly25\"","summary":"One of the better games for the 3DS but Online has lag issues","reviewText":"This games marks the first time the Dead or Alive series is on a Nintendo console, and the 3DS does the franchise justice. Great visuals, lots of replay value, and it makes use of every 3DS feature (spotpass? streetpass? coins? wifi? local multiplayer?) all here in a high quality package. This game marks the first time for me that I can log onto my 3DS wondering what new content has downloaded via spotpass. During a fight, the bottom touch screen acts as a guide to combos, or you can just tap the combo you want with your thumb and your character will automatically perform it which is a nice feature. Because you have to look down for a split second (an eternity in fighting games) its been my experience that by the time you select the proper combo/block/throw your opponent many times has already moved on to another position, especially if your trying to do a throw or hold instead of a strike.Having said all that, I feel that the online multiplayer needs work, first off almost every fight seems to have some lag, from just a little to so much its unplayable. Now I know you may start to say its my connection but I have to say, I have a high speed cable connection and have not had any lag on anything in recent memory besides this game. Aside from lag issues another thing I dont like about the online is; you meet up, you fight once, your disconnected from each other and have to go back to the lobby to search for someone else. I would have liked the option to go a few rounds with the same person instead of just one round. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I havent seen any online leader boards? Aside from the online needing work, the fps really does take a hit with the 3D on, which on single player doesnt really seem to bother me but may with some people.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

First of all, there's no way of setting game difficulty! So even though the normal playing mode is easy for people who are really into games, it's not so great for the casual gamer.Another thing I didn't like was the fact that if your team doesn't have characters who can fly, you're basically on your own. There are some levels when the character has to fly to get to the otherside. While doing so, you leave all the characters who can't fly behind and so you have to battle alone. Unless there's a way of working around this, which I can probably find on a walkthrough online, this was not good! I'm at the beginning of the game and can only choose certain characters who are limited in power and ability and only the female characters i.e. STORM, ROGUE, and JEAN GREY can fly. And they get beaten as soon as they reach the other side!Another thing I don't like is the fact that you have to pay 200 techbits (money in the game) to revive characters. So, if you don't have enough techbits and you're character dies, you won't be able to revive him/her.Once you enter a level you can't go back either, which really gets on my nerves since you won't be able to get more techbits once you smash everything there is to smash, which means you could run out of heroes if they all die.The reason I bought this game is because I really liked the X-Men Legends 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, by the same company Ravensoft. It seemed they worked out all the short comings of X-Men 1 in X-Men 2, aside from the freezing problem in 2. And Marvel Ultimate Alliance fixes all the problems.If you're a big X-Men fan and a serious gamer than this version of X-Men Legends won't be a problem for you. But if you're like me, a casual gamer who wants to enjoy the game and not be frustrated to no end by it, stick with X-Men Legends 2 or Marvel Ultimate Alliance.Also, a word of CAUTION for those who are planning on purchasing X-Men Legends 2, read the other reviews on that game because although it's fun to play, it crashes (freezes) when you reach ACT 4. And that's a problem with the game itself, not the disc, so even if you exchange the game for another one the same thing will happen.EDIT: This is in the comments section, because the \"edit\" button doesn't appear unless you leave a comment. So I pasted this info into the body of the review, for additional info for the game:First, when I consulted an online walk through and I discovered that in order to get characters who cannot fly over to the other side, you MUST use a character who can build bridges i.e. Iceman or Jean Grey. These characters will build a bridge with their mutant powers that allow the other heroes to cross over. I didn't know that because I played and finished MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE and X-MEN LEGENDS 2, before I played this game, so I assumed that characters who couldn't fly would just appear on the other side like they did in those games. So that solves that problem. But there are other stages that require one or two heroes with specific mutant abilities, otherwise you won't be able to progress. Unless you consult a walk through, you'll have no idea which character you need. Although the game does give hints in the dialogue.Next thing, game difficulty. The reason I had such a problem with this was due in part because the characters you choose to start the mission are at level one, while the enemies seem to be at level 05 or more. There are also some stages with many foes and each one is shooting machine guns at you, inflicting lot's of damage, so you have to keep repeating the stage over and over.However, once your characters level up to about 25 or so, the game becomes more evenly matched and it actually becomes really fun. The problem is, is that by that time you're pretty much at the end of the game.Another downer on leveling up; you end up having to spend more techbits(money) to revive your characters if they die. It started out at 200 but then started doubling as heroes leveled up, until it was up in the thousands!I also discovered that you can go back in some stages, but you can't extract. Also, in the later acts, there seemed to be techbits, health and energy packs everywhere, which is odd because they aren't that available in the first half of the game when you really need them most.Last thing, once you finish the game and you want to start over, all of your unlocked powers, gear, levels and characters go back to being locked! The only thing that becomes unlocked is alternate costumes for certain heroes. Not sure if this changes if you choose hard mode(I'm not even sure if there's a \"hard mode\"), but that makes replay non-existent.So, aside from it's shortcomings, I'll have to admit that I finally enjoyed the first X-MEN LEGENDS game... towards the last half. And I decided to add this comment to be fair to the game, but I still say, unless you're ready to be frustrated during the first half of game play, stick with XML 2 or MUA.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}

Van Wagenen","summary":"Nearly flawless controller, good value with P&C bundle","reviewText":"I am verrry glad Microsoft didn't change the successful controller formula they came up with many years ago. This is a fantastic controller. It feels like a tiny bit of a better fit in my hands than the 360 controller, and I like the new ridges on the thumbsticks.There were only two things I ever really thought they needed to change from the 360 controller, and they did both: Fix the crappy D-pad (it is much better now), and move the guide/dashboard button. I like how it is higher up on the controller now so you won't ever accidentally hit it when going for the start/back buttons.Speaking of which, I guess that's my only very minor complaint. They should have stuck with \"Start\" and \"Back\" as the names for those two center buttons. It sounds a lot less cool to read \"Press the menu button to begin\" on the Killer Instinct main screen, rather than the classic \"Press Start\". But, not a big deal.The rechargeable batteries seem a little smaller than the Xbox 360 ones, but worked great all through my Xbox One's launch night. The only very minor downside is it takes a few seconds longer to swap these batteries out than it did to swap out an Xbox 360 battery, but I like the tradeoff of having the Xbox One controller be slimmer and sleeker since there isn't a big battery jutting out the back.The charging cable is sufficiently long to play from my couch (8 feet away from my TV). Took an hour or so for the initial charging to finish from whatever capacity percentage these come from the factory. Don't bother with the third-party junk batteries. While the cable is just a basic micro USB and interchangeable, off-brand rechargeable batteries are rarely worth bothering with for the small difference in price.FYI: While amazon is sold out of these bundles at the moment, I saw stacks of them at my local Best Buy and Walmarts, so you may want to check there.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion.

Most of the shootouts are tactically fun, especially with an upgraded sniper rifle.I could not finish the game. About half way through I had a mission where I had to run from a monster while trying to destroy three pylons that can't be destroyed. All I did was unload every bullet I had.

{"product_name":"B000IMYKQ0","description":"The Wii Nunchuk controller is a secondary controller that adds even more innovation to the next generation of gaming, and does it all with less physical movement.Used in conjunction with the standard Wii remote, certain games need the Nunchuk controller for additional control options. Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"KAW999","summary":"Great","reviewText":"This is a requirement if you are going to play the Wii.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Peace Daddy \"Eclectic ReflectionZ\"","summary":"Solid game, not a God Of War \"rip-off\"","reviewText":"I don't quite understand why so many people are quick to write off Dante's Inferno as a \"God Of War rip-off.\" Sure, the game has some of the same general actions, i.e. hack and slash through increasingly difficult levels and bosses. But the distinction comes in that Dante's Inferno is much more sick and sadistic than God Of War. While fighting your way through hell, expect to see some sickening sexual abominations and completely disgusting characters. This may turn off a lot of people from this game, and it's a shame because I believe the game's \"over the top\" attributes are what set it apart from God Of War and other similar games. That being said, I don't believe that Dante's Inferno is as complex and involving as God Of War 3. The weapons and magic tiers seem watered down in Dante, which is a shame because it does take away from the overall gaming experience. However, at 60 frames per second hell is abhorrently beautiful, and there are enough unique enemies and mini puzzles to keep your interest for the entire game. Overall, I would recommend Dante's Inferno for the visuals and overall telling of the story, which is a unique and horrifying vision of the original work.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001XMA6I","reviewerName":"Griswel","summary":"Good Shooter - Great Fun","reviewText":"Star Wars Battlefront uses a two-thumb movement system - the left thumb moves your character, the right thumb changes your point of view.  Players of several other games will be used to this, and for the rest it is not that hard to master.You can choose quick action, Historical Campaign or Galactic Conquest.  Quick action is just what it sounds like.  The historical campaign leads you through a story, but the game doesn't really save yor progress, instead it keeps track of how far your character has ever gotten and you have to remember where you left off if yo replay or you have one solo and one co-operative game in progress.Galactic Conquest is a simplified strategy game, conquer different SW planets to get more bonus options (like Jedi Hero, special training), and take that advantage from the enemy.  Each player chooses one of these each battle.  Fight alongside Luke or Lord Vader!  Here at least you can save your progress in each new game.  A conquest can be completed in one or two sittings.The game offers LAN or online play, which I am unable to test.  It also offers splitscreen two player action.  While it is tough to adjust to the much smaller display area (half screen split top/bottom), the game is certainly playable this way.  You also get the choice of co-operative play, which is a welcome option, since zero-sum games can be frustrating for some family members.SW Battlefront allows you to control many vehicles, but most players will spend most of their time on foot.  Once you're good at ground combat you can kill enemies fast enough to give you the luxery of learning how to control the vehicles.  Your weapon choices are mostly blasters and missile or grenade launchers, though sniping is a lot of fun and you can also be a healer or ammo supplier.Unless you have LAN or online access SW Battlefront is the kind of game you're likely to play intensely for a few weeks and then come back to fron time to time.  The campaigns don't last long enough for you to play constantly for months on end.  There are many choices, on each side of the Civil War and from the old and new films.In short, Star Wars Battlefront is a fun shooter, but not the kind of near-perfect game that will destroy your life.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2004"}

Every character from MK 1-UMK3 return. At this point Earth & Outworld are close to being merged. The Elder Gods refuse to get involved so the only hope is Raiden he transforms into a mortal so he can survive in both relms. He leads the Earth Warriors into the final showdown. Also Johnny Cage has resurrected. Baraka is back just as Millena promised. Scorpion, Reptile & Sindel have all turned on Shao Kahn 2 sub bosses have came back Goro & Kintaro. A wild card is a new fighter called Chamelon. Nooob Saibot who was a hidden fighter in MK II is playable he was playable in The GEN & SNES version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 but he wasn't in the arcade or Saturn versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Rain a ninja dressed in purple & his name is Rain take a quick guess on that 1? Rain was originally fighting for Shao Kahn Kitana helped him recall his past his father was an Edian Knight who died in the war against Shao Kahn. The whole idea was 1,000's of centuries  ago The Mortal Kombat Tournament  was created by Wisemen of the east who saw a forbidden land that's why it was created. Shao Kahn has tried & tried to use the tournament to weaken The Dimensional Gates. Which ultimately Raiden wants the fight to the death with Shao Kahn. Which Noob Saibot sees this as the opportunity if Shao Kahn is killed Noob Saibot can get a fallen Elder God out of The Netherrelm. John Tobias did the smart thing tied up everything & wrapped up the original storyline & left it open for a 4th installment. This is the most complete version of Mortal Kombat 3 it has everything & then some. All fatalities, babalities, animalities, friendships & brutalities are intact all the areas are in it. You can even play as MK 1 Raiden MK II Jax MK Kung Lao MK 1 Kan. They even have there original fatalities too. You get to play as all the bosses. They didn't get endings though except for Shao Kahn but not much of 1. MK Trilogy got ported to The Nintendo 64 PS1 & Sega Saturn. The 64 version is cr ap you can play as Shao Kahn & Motaro but no Goro or Kintaro. Chamelon is a female in the 64 version. Shao Kahn & Motaro got fatalities in the 64 version though. I just never liked the 64 version it really never was made for fighting games I'm sorry its not. Maybe if they had a good arcade stick maybe. Saturn & Playstation ports are identical Saturn version costs more. Also if you play this on The Playstation 2 when you beat it you get a blank screen. I know The Playstation version has a thing for 1 button combos & a cheat for 1 button fatalities. So I'll be back to review Mortal Kombat 4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

If you live in an apartment (as many of us do) you may want to pass on the kinect, because if you do not have a significant amount of space, you will either not register in the game without moving all of your furnature outside while you play, and maybe not even then, but you will still run the risk of kicking walls, people, and pets. I thought I broke my toe after playing soccer and kicking the wall. You also have many glitches with this setup, for example: While I was playing with my daughter, my son stood up and walked to the bathroom, causing the game to register him as me and the game was finished with me as the big loser. Now while I usually let my kids beat me, you can see how this can be a major flaw while playing alone, or with a friend. I also noticed that some movements that I make have negative results on screen. I was racing in Joy Ride. I would turn my hands right to make a right turn, and the kinect would not register my movement and instead I would go straight off the track, also while I was playing, my son bumped me knocking me off balance and sending my car veering away.Next complaint: Price. Too high for a game systen eXCESSORY. I was upset when I found that the wii balance board was $100. Imagine how upset I was buying an accessory that is double that price, but my kids were begging me for one, so I thought that it would make a nice surprise for them, and it looked fun. That was a big mistake, I dropped $200 into something that they thought was fun for about a month, and now they use only once in a while, usually when they have friends over, and most of the times, not even then.Last complaint: Games, while there are a lots of games for the kinect that are fun, there are many more that seem to really blow @$$. I have spent what seems like thousands of dollars on buying games that are kinect compatible, only to find out that they suck. Like the most popular of game systems (PS2 and Wii) you will get a few great games followed by a pile of games that seem to be freeware, or games that took about 5 minutes to create and put together in someone's garage. Nothing I hate more, then seeing a game that looks fun, then trying it out and getting severly disappointed.I know that a lot of people will disagree with me on my review, I just want to say that this is my good solid opinion. I can respect you if you like the Kinect, and am even still considering giving it more and more tries, but I have owned it for 3 months and am still not impressed. My hopes are that the next generation game systems that adopt or continue on the Kinects technology will address these issues and fix them.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2012"}

Finding the best way to stagger (causes enemy to take more damage) an enemy is quite unique and despite how fluid and action heavy the combat looks its still the classic turn based game you know.The story is very well put together allowing you to pick exactly how deep (or not) you want to explore the games world and mythos. You can progress along and just watch things unfold or there are also texts to read that clue you into the story on a deeper level.The leveling up system is similar to the sphere grid from FF X (10) but a bit easier to manage, the same can be said for the pary AI system which plays like a simplified version of the gambits system from FF XII (12). With different sets that you can switch between on the fly during battle (Paradigm Shift)The games locations seem linear but progression is still at your own pace, enemies do respawn so you can level grind as you see fit and while the maps are (so far) straight paths the enviroments do not look it, you don't feel like your walking in a tunnel.The voice overs are stale and mostly emotionless (though each person will likely love or hate particular ones), and the slight changes to the soundtrack are mostly for the better. (you wont be listening to My Hands when you first power up the game).The characters are vacant espers, Lightning is like a mix of Cloud and Squall's best qualities (IMO)but with no real reason for the player to get attached to her.Graphically the game is astounding, you have never seen better graphics from the facial animations, to the clothing textures its all top notch. This game easily puts the other RPG's this gen to shame (Japanese or Western). for those wanting direct examples, FFXIII (on PS3) easily look better then Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age Origins and Fallout 3.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

The story is focused on Darth Vader's secret apprentice Starkiller, who is trying to find out his identity (whether or not he is a clone of the original Starkiller or not). The campaign is considerably short, with literally about 4 hours of gameplay. There is no multiplayer or splitscreen, which was a disappointment for me. I'm not quite sure why, but the gameplay seems to be a lot faster in this game when compared to the first one (i.e. your character runs faster). The graphics in this game are magnificent and are definitely an improvement over the already good first one. There is one DLC pack released lately, which is the Endor pack, which only costs 80 Microsoft Points! It is a very fun pack to buy. The ending of the campaign is a huge cliffhanger, so I hope they come out with another installment soon. Because of the low price, dirt-cheap DLC, and fun gameplay I would definitely recommend this to a friend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2012"}

The setup for this latest session of clump-rolling is that the people of Earth had become downright obsessed with the enigmatic King and his katamaris. Eagerly, they show their affection for King and katamari by making all sorts of requests for demonstrations of the katamari's power, and by generally feeding the King's ego with many, many compliments. The King, being ever the crowd-pleaser, is always happy to oblige the affectionate earthlings, and so he puts the Prince (and this time, his many, many cousins) to work, demanding even bigger and more exciting katamaris than ever before.We Love Katamari is basically just a big, happy love letter to the fans that contributed to the first game's success. Namco clearly had no intention of mucking up a winning formula, and as such, it has created a sequel that delivers more of the same fetchingly enjoyable gameplay and whimsical humor that made Katamari Damacy so much fun.

{"product_name":"B000062YIN","reviewerName":"Douglas Welzel","summary":"Currently the best racing game for the XBox","reviewText":"For the most part, Rallisport Challenge really does live up to the hype.  After disappointments like Wreckless and 4x4 Evo 2 I wasn't expecting much, but I was wrong.Rallisport centers around a career mode where you compete in different types of rally racing to gain points and unlock more cars and races.  Race types include ice racing, hill climbs, rallycross and traditional rallies.  The tracks are pretty well varied and can be very challenging, especially the hill climbs.My main complaint about the gameplay is the points system.  Points are accumulated based on factors such as finish position and car damage.  I would prefer to see overall rally position determined by cumulative time rather than points.  Games such as Collin McRae Rally 2 are superior in this area.Also, the cars aren't very tunable.  The standard suspension settings and tire choices are there, but that's all.  This game is clearly on the arcade side of the sim/arcade line.Controlling the cars smoothly with the XBox controller can be a bit difficult, especially when you drive the unlimited class cars.  The cars are rather touchy and the short travel of the XBox joystick makes subtle steering adjustments difficult.Finally, the graphics really are wonderful.  The attention to detail on the tracks is amazing.  Drive through the grass and you'll the individual blades.  Dust and damage will accumulate on your car over the course of a rally.  The presentation is really well done.  Just make sure to watch the replays because you'll probably miss most of it while trying to pilot your vehicle :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00002STEZ","reviewerName":"ajnrules \"ajnrules\"","summary":"This is...one helluva game!","reviewText":"What can I say? This game is HUGE, but it's fun. I was initially adamant at trying it out because I had been disappointed with Banjo-Kazooie the year before, but as soon as I got into it, I was hooked. This game is not for the weak of heart. It is about twice the size of Banjo-Kazooie. There are twice as many Golden Bananas as B-K had Jiggies. There are more than 3 times the amount of bananas (for Banana Medals) than B-K had Musical Notes. When you play a level in Donkey Kong 64 and then go back and try a level in Banjo-Kazooie, it feels terribly restricted. Yet the gameplay is still essentially the same. You move around the levels (you control five characters this time) and perform a variety of tasks, after which you are awarded a Golden Banana for your efforts. And then you lather, rinse, and repeat. Boss battles play an even larger part of a role than in B-K, where the only boss battle seemed to have been at the end of the game. Everybody have the same general moves, but they all must earn them independently from Cranky, Candy, or Funky with their specific coins.And then there are the tedious aspects that everybody remembers in Donkey Kong 64. With five playable characters, Rare seemed to want them to work as a team, but sometimes that may be a bit of a bother. No, it is actually more of a big bother. Let's suppose there is a switch that Donkey must open. We can assume that the things behind that door are for Donkey Kong, but nope. Rare just made a Donkey out of us. It's for Diddy and Tiny! And then there are times when you are walking along collecting green bananas for Chunky but all of a sudden, the bananas change to blue! So then your only choice is to find a Switch Barrel and change to Lanky. It gets a bit tedious. And then there are the backtracking. You have to unlock certain characters in the beginning, and they are not all in the first level. So you must then go back and get their respective Golden Bananas in previous levels. Meh. All of this constant switching really takes away the fun out of the game, especially if you're playing it through for the fourth time. It's still worth it to play through the entire game at least once, although certain frustrating moments would make it acceptable to avoid the 101%.But Donkey Kong 64 is still an amazing game. Even if you hate the repetition, you can't overlook the technological wonders Rare has instilled. The game had been one of the most stunning five years ago, as Rare was already setting themselves up as one of the experts in graphical achievements. Although each Kong look rather bland now, the game's visuals are certainly pleasing on the eyes. However, the same can't be said about the game's camera. The camera can often go crazy at times, especially during swimming moments or on Diddy's Jet Barrels. Those are times when I go on a cursing frenzy. There are other equally frustrating times. I suppose the camera had always been the death of 3D platform/adventure games. The game's music is terrific. Although people have a love/hate relationship with the infamous D.K. Rap, the rest of the game's soundtrack are lovely. Songs like the Main Menu music and Frantic Factory are catchy, while Fungi Forest can actually send a chill down your spine. And then there's the humor. Actually, some of the game's humor seems to be kind of forced, but then again, the same can be said about the humor in Banjo-Kazooie. Other parts are genuinely funny. However, as spectacular as the game is, the game's tedium and spotty camera keeps it from becoming a classic. It's too bad. Nintendo had such high hopes for this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVLI2","description":"","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"A reminder of Capcom's glory days","reviewText":"Oh Capcom, how I have I have a love-hate relationship with you. You make great games, but milk them half to death (especially with all of the fighting games as of late.) You create memorable characters and stories, yet you've been throwing many away lately (I'm STILL irked about Mega Man Legends 3.)  However, this game is a reminder why I fell in love with this company in the first place. RE is still a series that Capcom cares for, and this game shows that when Capcom's good, they're really good. So, let's take a look at what I consider to be the killer app for the 3DS, Resident Evil: Revelations.GRAPHICS: I don't know exactly know the graphical capabilities of the 3DS, but I'm guessing they're around Gamecube quality. With that expectation in hand, this game looks amazing. This game looks like a watered-down version of RE5, making it quite amazing looking on a handheld. The dark atmosphere of the game really helps to bring back the feeling of horror that the older games brought. The 3D is also tastefully done. No gimmicks, just depth. The only complaint I have about the graphics are that during gameplay, the characters' mouths don't move when they talk. That might have been okay if this were a regular DS game, but it looks really awkward considering how good the graphics are.MUSIC/SOUND: A great soundtrack that keeps you immersed. Combine that with crystal clear sound effects, and you got a great sounding game in a handheld package. The voices are great as well, reminding you how far gaming has gone in voice acting since the days of \"STOP IT! DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!\"STORY: The story takes place between 4 and 5, and it stars the classic RE duo, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. It's your typical RE conspiracy plot, but it's filled with some good twists, as well as some pretty memorable new characters. While it appears to be a standalone story, it could have some connections to RE6.GAMEPLAY: This game is the Super Mario 3D land of RE, combining the best of the old with the new. The game controls very similarly to 4 and 5, but don't think it's going to play like it. Unlike 4 and 5, where you can massacre everyone and get away with it, you have to conserve your ammo, just like the older games. While not as stingy on ammo as the old games, you'll want to avoid the enemy whenever possible. Also returning from the old games is the backtracking. You'll have to return to places constantly when you get the right key or item.This game balances out the old stuff with elements of the new. No ink ribbons to save; it does it automatically, though not to the point where you feel babied. Weapons are upgradable with items that you can remove and put on other weapons, giving you some pretty nice customization options. You also have this item called the Genesis, which allows you to scan for items, and if you scan enough enemies, you get a healing item. You mainly play as Jill, but a few other characters are playable from time to time, and you usually have a partner with you. It's much less annoying than the partner system in RE5; all your partner does is shoot, and he/she can't die.This game features some pretty creative monsters and some challenging boss fights. It's not just an army of dimwitted zombies or infected people that you shoot in the face and then kick. Many have certain weak points, and some can be quite deadly. They don't get stunned with just a shot, unlike many of the enemies in the newer RE games.My gripes are few. I don't like how they dumb-downed the healing system. Gone is the herb-combining; now you just have a green herb only, and it heals you all the way. Speaking of which, when you're hurt, the screen gets bloody, making it a bit hard to see when you're really wounded. It's okay in games where your health regenerates, but not in this game. Lastly, the game doesn't have as much puzzles as it should. There are a few good ones here and there, but it could have done with more. A lot are gimmicky wire-crossing puzzles involving the touch screen. But all of these complaints are VERY minor.OVERALL: If you're wanting a reason to get a 3DS or looking for a reason to dust yours off, this is the game for you. Like I said, this game proves that Capcom's still got it. Also, check out the Circle Pad Pro. It makes the controls of this game much smoother.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

This game takes everything that made blood money so great and throws it in the trash.-There are assassinations that happen in cutscenes-Quick time events happen for most melee combat-Linear levels that pretend to be open sandboxes(It's broken into simple checkpoints that divide up levels which are tiny)-mandated killing of people other than the contracts, making some levels impossible to get silent assassin on-levels that have nothing to do with killing someone and feature random objectives-No weapons selection for each mission-AI renders most disguises useless, if ANYONE wearing the same thing as you see you, you're instantly recognized.

It is no longer about disguises and purely about hiding behind boxes and tables, which is baffling that the AI deems that a more natural state than just walking around.The list goes on but I'm tired.

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"Ziggy","summary":"Dead on Arrival","reviewText":"Resident Evils 1&2 for the original Playstation are two of the best games ever made.  RE2 alone surpasses nearly all the other horror based games that were created for the consule, and there were plenty to follow.  With the evolution of the new gaming systems came new Resident Evil games.  RE Nemsis proved to be a challenging game of cat and mouse.  RE Survivor squandered in its attempt to switch the horror genre to the first person.  Now Resident Evil is back on the Playstation after some new titles under the Nintendo name.  The suspsense and antcipation for the game were killing me so I quickly bought it when it was released in April of this year.  Little did I know that the game itself would kill me.  RE Outbreak is quite frankly the most dissapointing horror game in the storied franchise.  The game is bad, very bad, and it has a number of reasons why.  First, you can not turn a survial based game into a team effort.  The fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous.  The game doesn't allow you to focus on the tasks and puzzles at hand, not to mention the 5 billion zombies that are thrown your way.  The loading screens are absolutely agonizing.  They were never good on the PSOne, so you think with the adaption to the PS2 this minor glich would get cleared up.  Oops.  The story is slow, the characters are dull, and the constant reptitive lines spoken by them is enough to make you want to turn into a zombie.  Oh wait, you can in this game, and then kill all of your teammates.  What?  Who came up with that brillant idea?  With such a storied past you think Capcom would play off its original success.  Instead, Resident Evil Outbreak is dead on arrival.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

Rhodes","summary":"It's Fun, But Severely Dated... Even for Its Time","reviewText":"REVIEWERS NOTE: Throughout this review the product is referred to as Dragon Quest VII and not Dragon Warrior VII.  They're both the same game, but the truth is: the series is called Dragon Quest.  So don't get confused.  I also refer to the other games in the series as Dragon Quest and not Dragon Warrior.Dragon Quest is huge in Japan.  The games actually have to be release on Sundays or Holidays because of how big they are.  The Dragon Quest games are not nearly as big in America.  The other Dragon Quest games are actually a real treat--particularly the SNES games that never made it to the states.  Dragon Quest VII does not hit the height of the NES and SNES games in any way shape or form, mainly because this game in particularly, does nothing to actually make the Dragon Quest games mature, and that's really sad.  It's great that they got it together for Dragon Quest VIII, but it can't stop the seventh in the series from being the black sheep of them all.It's really sad to because of all the Dragon Quest games, the seventh installment is one of the only ones to have a satisfying storyline where things actually progress and you don't spend a lot of time running around so lost you don't know what to do.  It's not a deep story by any means, but it does have more focus here than other Dragon Quest games.  Because of the structure of the story, there's not too much you can explore from the get go, and thus you're limited.The first thing about Dragon Quest VII that people will note is that the game looks absolutely horrible.  For a late generation PSX game going up against the likes of Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX at the time, this game looks like a rejected Super Nintendo game, and it may be because it was originally in development for that particularly system.  The towns look really bad, the textures are mostly pixelated, the character sprites look horrendous.  Simply put, this is just a terrible looking game.  The sound effects are even worse.  You'll dread each time you have to pick up a barrel and toss it.  You'll dread opening a door.  The games framerate isn't even steady.  The only thing to the games graphical credit is that some of the enemies don't look so bad, and that it's colorful.  Still, even for those who don't base their judgment of a game on graphics will have to take a moment to get used to just how terrible they really are.The second annoying thing is the menu system.  It's the exact same one that was used in Dragon Quest VI, and it's just a pain to navigate.  In a world where games like Final Fantasy VII made navigating the menu as easy chewing food, Dragon Quest VII makes it a tedious task.  Characters are limited to what they can hold and I don't want to go into the nightmare of equipping and re-equipping characters over and over again.  The menu interface is absolutely horrible.  It seems like such a dumb thing to complain about, but in an RPG released on the Playstation, inventory management shouldn't be so difficult, nor should I have to spend more time in the menu than actually exploring a dungeon.Combat is also a big problem.  It's not that battling isn't fun.  Firstly, you don't get into a battle for quite some time.  In fact, you'll spend the first couple of hours of the game roaming around not battling anything.  It'll be a miracle if some gamers can even hold out that long.  Especially because it's an RPG with little story exposition in the beginning.  When you do make it to that point though, you'll be met with mixed feelings.  For some odd reason battling is fun, but again, the graphics really make you wonder sometimes.  The battle system is essentially the same as it was on the NES and SNES.  The problem here is simple: This isn't either of the two systems.  I don't mind the combat being menu based, but the fact that you don't see your characters and that they don't physically go up and strike the enemy makes battling feel a little... empty and uninspired.  Some of the enemies actually look pretty good, but I'm bothered that the battle engine is exactly the same as Dragon Quest I from way back when.  Dragon Quest VIII certainly did a far better job in at least making their battles look good.  Here, you just feel as if you're not involved enough.  It's simple, and it is fun because the combat is surprisingly deep and strategic.  Even better the game is a challenge.  But all the while you can't help but thinking you're playing an NES game on a system that is capable of so much more.They say it'll take you about 100 hours to plow through Dragon Quest VII.  The game is, in fact, huge.  There's tons of sidequests, and just when you think the game is getting stale, they do manage to throw something else at you that gets a little more involved in the gameplay.  The job system, for instance, comes along hours after you've begun your quest, but it adds a lot of variety when it's finally added in there.  Enough to keep you busy for hours.  What a lot of people don't mention about Dragon Quest VII, however, is that a lot of those 100 hours are spent on heavily raising your party to getting better levels and stats.  Dragon Quest is known for making gamers work, and Dragon Quest VII actually does that.  For example, the game will not let you overpower your characters job classes.  There's a point where they do cut you off and you have to advance forward.  However, you've still go to worry about their normal levels, and you don't gain a whole lot of experience or gold from these monsters.  Thus, of the 100 spent to plow through the game, you'll more than likely spend more than 50 hours just leveling up to take on the next challenge.  And Dragon Quest VII is not an easy game.While the sound effects are bad, the music of the game itself is quite good.  Dragon Quest has always had good music and Dragon Quest VII is no exception.  The game falls short in almost every category except music.  Here's where the game truly shines, and not only that but Dragon Quest fans will recognize some fantastic tunes from other games.The bottom line is simple.  Is Dragon Quest VII a good game?  The answer is surprisingly, yes.  You just have to really be able to get passed the fact that you're playing an NES game on a system capable of so much more.  Simplicity has kept the series alive at least, but the game seriously looks like a rejected SNES title that they felt they needed to dress up in tattered clothes and shove onto the Playstation.  The game isn't bad, it's just that by the time Dragon Quest reached the seventh installment, one has to wonder why the developers didn't actually make it look or play like a Playstation RPG.If you can look past the NES appeal, Dragon Quest VII is a great game.  It's fun to battle in (despite it's graphics).  There are tons of mini-games and sidequests to do, and there's so much variety that you'll want to play just for the sheer fact that you KNOW you haven't uncovered anything.  Still, the old school nature of this game is going to be hard to swallow, even for old school gamers.  The game is slow, the menu system is horrible, the graphics are subpar, the battles feel like you're doing nothing.  With these kinds of cons taunting the game, it's hard to recommend it even to die hard Dragon Quest fans.  Fun to play, but it's asking a lot gamers to look past its glaring shortcomings.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2006"}

This game is far superior to KZ2 in almost every way, such as improved AI, solid plot/character development, high-quality visuals, balanced game pacing, great mission variety, and awesome level design. Without spoiling anything, you will get to control all kinds of vehicles/devices, which worked extremely well and added to the depth of the game.Another big enhancement from KZ2 is your AI squadmates can heal you if they are nearby, which as simple as it may seem, actually makes the game more immersive, since you find yourself sticking together to reap the benefit of a \"second chance\". Conversely, to help your chances of surviving a tough fight, you can also heal your squadmates if he's down.Campaign mode is not long (6-8 hours total) but it is extremely satisfying from start to finish. As mentioned previously, the pacing and variety have both been improved significantly. I am not a huge multiplayer fan but from the short time I've had with it, it seems KZ3 has sped things up a bit, which is an improvement.I have just one tip: Do yourself a favor and don't read too many reviews or look at too many videos of the game so that you can experience the full effect of the game for yourself!!I highly recommend this game to all serious FPS fans![EDIT: 3/14/2011]After spending about 20 hours playing multiplayer online, I can say that KZ3 mp ranks very high up there amongst the best mp experience I have had. After playing all COD titles and BFBC2, plus KZ2, this multiplayer really sets the new standard in terms of depth, variety, and entertainment value. Many people don't like the absence of customizable class, but I saw it as a simplification of the system that makes things that much more enjoyable. Also, the ability to \"buy\" skills after earning skill points is absolutely awesome. You no longer need to be stuck leveling up then finding out you unlocked some lame weapon or perk that you have no interest in using. Instead, you get to choose how you want to build up your skill set. You can even look ahead to see what the future unlocks are so you can plan ahead and/or save up your points for later. This seems like a small change but significantly enhances the depth and fun factor overall! With Crysis 2 just around the corner, it's going to be interesting to see how KZ3 stacks up against arguably one of the most anticipated games of the year!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Stunning","reviewText":"Very rarely does a movie generate a decent video game tie in, but thankfully X-Men Origins: Wolverine managed to pull off one of the most exciting games I've played in a long time. It's the Wolverine fans biggest dream come true and that is a game that captures the Wolverine character perfectly while allowing for the amazing gore and fighting you would expect from a character with 3 sharp blades sticking out of each hand. Usually video game tie-ins follow the general plot path of the film and add a bit around that to make the game more fun, but with this it seems that the creators just wanted to make the game they've always wanted. Because of it being a tie-in the creators were forced to maintain a certain level of movie-game relationship and it seems that in parts of the game, small amounts of the movie plot were snuck in to satisfy the movie execs while concentrating more time and effort on the story and game they wanted.  The game, however, is plagued by repetition and I think if more time were spent on the move diversity and combos along with a larger diversity of boss battles, this game would've been 5 stars.The plot of the game focuses around two separate events three years apart. The earlier events are set in Africa with Team X and tell the story of the conflicts between Logan's morals and that of the mission of Team X which is to discover the main source of the meteor deposits. The plot 3 years in the future focuses a bit around the movie plot as Logan seeks out revenge against his brother Victor Creed, but first he must seek the help of Col. William Stryker. Stryker cannot be trusted and Logan, after enduring the Adamantium procedure, breaks out of the Weapon X facility and continues his quest for revenge which takes him to the cybernetics lab which is developing a mutant hunter/killer machine known as the Sentinel.The game takes on a platform format of play with some intense action and easily some of the best boss battles I've played in a game in years. There are RPG elements as your character increases in levels as you play and murder your way through the game in as many stylish ways as possible. The better you utilise your environment and unique Wolverine skills to take out your enemies the more exp points you will gain. You will also locate what are called mutagens which you can use to upgrade Wolverines powers to make him a stronger and more brutal killing machine. The moves can become quite repetitive as there is a lack of a diversity of combos and other ways of battling through the game.  The game also takes on a puzzle type format in numerous parts of the game as you will need to go here or there to solve a little bit of a puzzle to get to the next stage of a particular level. They are refreshing but can become quite frustrating. Enemy AI is surprisingly good. When you're battling a large group of soldiers, for instance, and you start brutalising one or two, the surrounding soldiers will be cautious about approaching you which I thought quite cool.The look of it is superb and I truly mean that. The visuals give you the belief that there was no chance this game was rushed, it looks like a lot of time was spent perfecting the look of the environments and the characters. The detail in Wolverine is stunning especially when you start to see the skin and costume be blown and torn to pieces as you battle enemies. Seeing the Adamantium skeleton makes getting beat up particularly cool as you can enjoy watching him heal from the sheer brutality of the enemy attacks. Lighting is realistic and the levels in Africa and also the level set just after you escape the Weapon X facility when you are walking through water, the liquid reacts realistically and just makes the environment seem that much better. The gore is the best part of the game and is by far one of the only things a true Wolverine fan would have been interested in. The gore is shockingly brutal and it rightfully earns the game its ESRB: M rating.My favourite part of the game was by far the boss battle with Gambit as you are pitted against him high up on a glowing casino sign. The epic nature and feel of the battle itself just made me think \"wow, this game was worth my time\" and it's very rare a singular level makes me feel like that about the game. It actually proved how diverse this game could be if the effort were put into making all the bosses a bit more individually unique in terms of the battles. Also, the Sentinel mission is absolutely superb as the hint towards these in X-2 left me wanting more and giving you the ability to actually take one onIt's an immensely fun game and, although I think without the film plot holding it back this could have been so much better, I still think it's a massive achievement. If a sequel to this is to come I hope more is concentrated on boss and combo diversity and maybe even some form of online multiplayer to give it that added appeal. The voicing, music and sound effects aren't anything to write home about and the repetition doesn't do it any favours but the cool addition of costume unlockables such as the classic blue and yellow Wolverine gear are excellent. In closing, you should really get this game. If you're a fan of the Wolverine character then this will fast become your favourite game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2009"}

Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is a limited-time offer including the 2009 &#x2018;RPG of the Year' Dragon Age Origins, the Dragon Age Origins-Awakening expansion pack, plus all nine additional content packs.","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Amazing value, for a great RPG","reviewText":"A while ago a friend lent me his copy of Dragon Age Origins for the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed the game, I had a number of other games that I was playing, and I returned it without finishing it. With the price drops of the Ultimate Edition, I decided to finally pick up a copy, for the PS3, but it sat unused until a short time ago.This collection comes with the original game as well as all the DLC. You'll still be prompted about a new DLC when you're on the start screen, but it's actually telling you about one that collected two of the DLC together, which I think is just an oversight on their end.The DLC display as a second disc when you put the game in (there's only one physical disc) and require that you install each separately. I have an idea of why they did this, but it's unfortunate that you have to install each, as you can't just start the process, walk away to do something else, and then come back to have them all installed.As for the game itself, I wanted this because of the RPG elements, and that I had played games of this type on PC many years ago. While initially people were worried that PC gameplay wouldn't cross over to the consoles, I don't think that was really necessary for this game.However, there are times when I wish I had a mouse so I could better control which enemies my character attacks, but over the course of my many hours this only came up a handful of times, and in all but a few cases it didn't matter much.The story for this game is actually quite good, with a nice variety depending upon your actions. There are different origins for each character type (with race, birth, and class all determining who you start as), and whether you care about the trophies/achievements or not, I'd recommend playing through them all, especially since you'll meet a number of the characters later, no matter your origin.I ran into one glitch where a battle never ended, but at this point there's enough information about the game to know what to do to prevent it. I also found the initial loading screen to take a heck of a long time. I don't think this is related to the number of saves I had, and my network connection is fairly quick, but I didn't care enough to actually research it too deeply, so I can't complain.This was my 10th platinum trophy, so I obviously enjoyed the base game enough to play the heck out of it (although the base trophies are more time consuming, depending upon what you do, than hard).I honestly have a hard time finding any faults with the game. Is Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition really a five-star game? I could certainly see myself finishing the DLC that I didn't get through (including Awakening, which was once a game sold by itself), and have basically gone through all the main story options, so ... I supppose it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00DE2W5XG","description":"","reviewerName":"Connor333","summary":"Amazing experience so far","reviewText":"Pros:Controller - feels amazingGames - some ppl say they do not like the launch games. I bought this for battlfield 4 - and will easily play this for a year. It's nice having Battlefield finally look really good and run so smooth. Very fun! More games I'm interested in come out in a few months,and this game alone will keep me busy.User Interface - Excellent. Never thought I would say this, but the UI is so smooth, fast, and flawless, that I actually don't mind paying $50/year for PS+ (which is required now for gaming) Sony seems to have done their homework - and this provides an excellent experience for gamers.  Many will say, \"why don't you just get a PC?\"  Well, the UI gives gamers and experience that I have yet to experience on my PC.Wobble? - I became concerned when ppl were posting videos on PS4 \"wobbling\" when you push down on a corner. So the first thing I did was try this out. This is such a joke - you have to apply about 8 pounds of pressure to a corner for it to \"wobble\". This will be the very last time I need to push down on it - as all buttons are in the front, and disk loads in the front as well. Talk about ppl being to fussy. This would be like me saying the xbox one has terrible build quality because the kinect tips over when I push down on it.Cons-Bundled mic/mono headset: This thing is a joke, and very poor quality. Does not fit in my ear, and is too quiet, cannot hear people talking. Sony bundled the headset to encourage ppl to use communication during gameplay, but I feel this is the same as not bundling a headset at all. I will be using my usb headset instead and tossing this one in the trash. Which leads me to:USB: Only two usb ports. I wish it at least had three. I would like to charge controller, use usb headset, and have my wireless keyboard plugged in at once. May not seem like a big deal, but I'm hoping to get lots of years out of this machine, and unplugging and replugging stuff will only ad to wear and tear.500GB hard drive: This may seem like a lot, but I know I will have to upgrade in the future. My one game I have requires about 38 gigs of space, and Killzone will need 50gb. Yes , this is even if you have the disk. Day 2 with console and I only have 320 gigs left. I can see requiring to upgrade to a 2tb in the next year or so.Summary: I give this system 5 stars despite the cons, because I feel that I am getting my money's worth. For 400 bucks I have a system that will entertain me for many years to come. Please note that I am not one of those \"fanboys\", who have blind pride in a system and will bash another. The Xbox one looks amazing too - I have always been with xbox. I did my research, and the ps4 is for me - at least for now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

McKenzie","summary":"Wrestling Gaming Takes A Proud Stride Forward!","reviewText":"Just last night I threw in the original \"WWF SmackDown\" for the PS-one that was released in 2000.  I am amazed at how far this series has come.  What was once an arcade-y fighting game with a WWF gloss, has evolved and developed into one of the finest wrestling games ever to be released.MODES AND FEATURES---This time, THQ and Jakks and Yukes had the goal of bringing more reality and depth to the \"SmackDown\" series.  What really stands out in this series, however, is an attempt to please all kinds of fans.  Casual gamers can step right in play any kind of match they want with up to 6 players.  Those who really dig storylines and presentation have a more linear, yet more satisfying Season Mode complete with animated cutscenes and good voice-over work.  My favorite new addition is something that Sports fans will love.  Players can now tackle the awesome General Manager mode and compete either against the computer or another player, and try to gain better ratings to produce the ultimate show.  It could be a little less text-based, but otherwise, it's fantastic!GRAPHICS---These wrestling models look great.  They haven't been glossed over or made extra-shiny like previous WWE games have done with its superstars.  Instead, they look eerily like their real-life counterparts.  Shawn Michaels and Batista are the best examples to show this.  The crowds still look like junk, but since when haven't they.  The only game with a decent crowd is Ubi-Soft's \"Rocky\".  The pyro-technics during entrances also look pitiful.  But I can forgive those quibbles because the animation quality is \"SmackDown\" at its best.  A few moves still don't look quite right, but considering that 70% of the maneuvers have been re-animated, one can't help but admire the effort.SOUND---From a music standpoint, you don't hear any music when you're wrestling.  However, the tracks that THQ picked to use during the menu system is their best lineup yet.  The songs are accessible to use for Create-A-Wrestler, and worth listening to.  The entrance music for the wrestlers are all authentic (save for a few legends) and sound clear.  However, during the Royal Rumble matches, I couldn't really hear them.  The wrestlers' voice-overs don't sound as canned, and are much better than last year's initial attempt at this feature.  The commentary, however, is one step back from last year's entry.  The two-man teams of Michael Cole/Tazz (SmackDown) and Jerry Lawler/Jim Ross (RAW) deliver forced dialogue that randomly interrupts depending on the match situation.  Cole and Tazz are forgiveable, because they sound like they would on TV (not a compliment, but at least it's authentic).  But Lawler and JR absolutely suck.  Never before have I yearned so much for a SmackDown match just because of this problem.GAMEPLAY---So what's new here?  Again, the General Manager and Season modes are a plus.  Season mode once again tackles a linear storyline (one for RAW, and one for SmackDown) similar to \"WrestleMania 21\" for the X-Box.  Instead of the Season being a solid experience each time through, like the fifth \"SmackDown\" game back in 2003, this year it's going to be a great first-time experience, and with no reason to go back.  I prefer the former version of Season mode, which explains why I love the General Manager Mode so much.  GM Mode is simply one of the best ideas ever put in a wrestling game.  I wish it wasn't as text-based as it is, and featured a little stronger presentation, but it is feature I absolutely crave!  As far as matches go, the new Stamina system requires more strategy on your part to win matches.  Work too hard and too fast, then your wrestler is going to be pretty useless.  The pre-match minigames are back, and thankfully are optional.  As far as match modes go, they're all back from last year with a few new goodies.  The Buried Alive match is the big one, where you must throw your opponent in a Casket and perform to mini-games to win.  I liked this mode at first, but don't really like it all that much.  The same goes for the Backstage Brawls.  This feels cheap, because instead of free-roaming environments, you get to pick 1 of 3 rooms and battle it out.  The Parking Lot is much better than last year's, but the other two rooms aren't that much fun.  The Royal Rumble hasn't changed at all from last year, except for the new Stamina system (this new feature is awesome!).  The Bra-and-Panties match has now been integrated into a Fulfill Your Fantasy Match, where pillow fights, spankings, and clothing removal raise a crowd-pleasing meter.  First one to fill it wins.  This is actually kind of fun, but not a must-play.  What surprised me most, however, was the new amount of attention given to the Steel Cage match.  You can now climb out the door, and escaping from the Cage requires timing-based button pushes instead of mindless button-mashing.  This is the best Steel Cage version to date!  Now, throw all of these new ideas plus refined animations, and this game is pretty damn good.WHAT'S NOT TOO GOOD?---I think it's worth mentioning that the roster this year isn't as good as any of the other \"SmackDown\" games.  As much as I like playing as some of the new talent (Chris Masters, Carlito), I can't help but feel that \"SmackDown: Here Comes The Pain\" still has the best playable roster (Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Kevin Nash...all not here).  I also think that as good as the gameplay is, I kind of prefer the faster-paced fighting.  Maybe if the new features were put into a faster-paced game, then it would the ultimate experience.  The use of weapons is really sluggish, making Hardcore matches, or cheating for that matter, less fun.  Speaking of cheating, the Clean and Dirty meters are pointless.  I never liked them from last year, but thankfully, they don't play as much of a deal as they did last year.  Also, on a side note, the aerial attacks aren't as accessible.  Performing a top-rope finisher is an absolute pain in the ass!OVERALL---The last paragraph is really harsh, I know, but what matters is that this really good game is worth purchasing.  My criticisms for this game are mainly as a WWE fan, instead of as a fighting game player.  When one is as obsessed with wrestling a I am, our expecations become damn-near unmeetable.  But make no mistake, this is the second best of the \"SmackDown\" series (I still prefer \"Here Comes The Pain\"), and one of the best wrestling games since \"WWF No Mercy\" (Nintendo 64, 2000).  Wrestling gaming is going to get nothing but better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2005"}

I tried to play Arkham City on PC but that experience was horrible.On Christmas when I got a PS3 I decided to play this game out of curiosity to see if I can really beat it.I beat the game in three days. How? Pure luck and determination. There so many buttons to be accounted for while playing this game, it was too much in the beginning but as you keep playing everything starts to get smoother little by little. Even though I beat the game I'm still a horrible fighter but I can get the job done.The game is sort of addicting, after you finish one 'step' (which can be a side quest or doing something that helps with the main plot) you automatically are trying to finish the next step ahead.Arkham City: You play as the amazing Batman, you're trying to see what's going on when a new prison called Arkham City is created with the help of the mayor of Gotham and one of Batman's enemies Hugo Strange. The more you investigate the more suspicious this great prison seem to be and you'll find out what's the true purpose of this prison. Not only you're stuck in that prison until you find out what Hugo's true plans are, you have to deal with a surplus of inmates running loose along with the Penguin, Two-Face, Joker, etc. Trust me! The ending of the game will surprise you.Why I love this game is you do feel like Batman; you get access to all these gadgets, beat up criminals, and if you don't feel like playing through the main plot you can explore Arkham City any time you want with side quests, helping political hostages, searching for missing policemen/medical workers or beating up inmates just for the heck of it.The soundtrack is great, at certain times when you're trying to silently take down criminals the music adds in the suspense and tension perfectly. It makes me more nervous as I play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A more than worthy sequel","reviewText":"Gears of War was THE game that made an XBox 360 worth owning, quickly becoming an action game classic that set new standards for the genre.  Now we finally have Gears of War 2, a game that while not as jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring as the original, still manages to improve on many aspects of the original, while at the same time providing the same spectacular action elements that made the first game so good to begin with.  The storyline gets expanded here with this sequel, as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago prepare to make a last stand against the Locust as mankind's days appear to be dwindling down.  In terms of overal gameplay, not much as changed since the first game, but then again, not much had to either.  There have been some minor refinements in terms of the game's cover system, and the difficulty seems more forgiving this time around as well, although it doesn't detract from the moments where the game can be quite challenging.  Drop-in co-op support and XBox Live multiplayer modes are where the real meat of Gears of War 2 is to be found, and the assortment of new weapons, some brutal new attacks, gorgeously rendered environments, and some unforgettable enemies make this game a sequel that measures up to, and in some cases even surpasses, the original.

I bought the game used and installed the latest patch (7.7 unofficial which includes the last official patch) before playing.  It worked fine.  There were no problems with the game crashing or getting stuck.Overall it is a fine role playing/action game.  I would not call it a sandbox game as some earlier reviewers have.  Yes, you can wander around as much as you want but the whole game is quest driven.  New areas do not become accessible until you reach certain points in the main quest.  There are no respawning adversaries to fight.  There are no mini games.  There is an arcade with pinball machines but you can't play them.  It would be nice to have a casino with the ability to play poker, blackjack, roulette, etc.  The game does have a very open feel to it though.  It certainly is not linear.  I wish there were some non-quest related areas to play around in.  How about an apartment building with random tenants that would change throughout the game?The role playing aspects are nicely designed and balanced.  You can't customize your character much though.  Basically you pick your sex and clan and have a few beginning experience points to assign.  The various clans have different powers so that adds to the replay value.  The quests are varied and fun.  The quest log could be a little more detailed.  A couple times I got to a point and didn't know how to proceed.  Thankfully there are several walkthroughs available online.I loved the general atmosphere of the game.  The graphics and voice acting were fine.  To me the combat was a bit jerky at times, especially in the beginning.  Maybe that was done intentionally as a way of simulating a lack of experience.  The stealth aspects of the game, like crawling through ducts, were a lot of fun.  The difficulty level seemed to vary widely.  For the most part I had no trouble but toward the end of the game there were quests that were much harder.  At one point (the giant werewolf) I almost gave up on the game.  It took me several dozen tries before finally getting past it.Overall, if you like role playing you should definitely get this game.  I would rate it about a 4.5 and will round up due to the fun factor.  There are also some mods available but at this point I haven't tried any.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Utterly frustrating with a side order of total disappointment.","reviewText":"This game was said to have been much more than it is.  In concept, it's neat.  In application, it utterly failed.  It could have been so much more than it actually is and that is the source of my frustration.  It has a very neat world, decent atmosphere at times, and kind of a twist on FPS.The problems are immense.The graphics engine is out of date and still manages to grind my setup to a halt.  My system runs most any FPS in high resolution, with everything turned up -- and barely runs Stalker with everything turned down.  Unbelievable.The quest structure/implementation is completely broken.  Utterly.  If you can even figure out what to do some of the time you'll be lucky if you don't fail a quest without explanation only to reload, do the same thing, and complete the quest.  The scripted events are crucial to your progression through the game, but can easily be derailed by quest failure.The enemy respawing is just ridiculous.  They'll randomly respawn right in front of you.  Endless groups of enemies just appear near you.  You can clear an area, walk a ways, turn around, and there's another giant group of enemies.Enemies can hone in on you and fire accurately and incredible ranges, while you can't even see them.  Apparently bandits have night vision implanted into their skulls and have entire areas of the land wired with motion sensitive alarms -- because you can't creep three inches if one is within a hundred meters without being seen or heard.The patch -- for the love of god -- do not install it if you've already started playing.  It invalidates all previous save games.  It's also a mostly multi-player patch and has almost no value for a single player person.It's amazing what the software industry gets away with selling for money these days.  If you enjoy lots of build up with sudden aggravating let downs then this is the game for you.  If you enjoyed Serious Sam but desire the pretense of a tactical shooter, sorta, then this game is for you.Personally, I'd much rather enjoy just spending my money on a cheese grater to which I could apply liberally to tender parts of my body.----- UPDATE ------I wish I could go back and change the star rating for this game.  I feel I was a bit rash, but the things I stated above are essentially still valid.  I would give the game 4 stars overall, with a 5 star fun rating.OVERALL: ****FUN: *****I don't feel right about the Serious Sam comparison -- that was just such a violently crappy game -- and I apologize to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  :(  Please, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., will you take me back?The first 20% of the game can be very frustrating, but it is worth bearing with.  The game really takes off once you reach a certain point, and while it still has problems, is worth the play.  The maps get increasingly cooler and complex, the environments are amazing.  It's too bad the economy in the game isn't too substantial.  They've patched the game a few times since I originally played it and those patches have much improved the entire experience -- tweaks, bug fixes, changes, etc.  I've completed the game many times, and each time I enjoy it.  The fact that the game has alternative endings is also a plus.Overall, a good game of considerable length and depth, and while it has it's share of irritations and problems, is worth the journey.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2007"}

The ONLY downfall of this game is how you are young Link for the entire game (until you recover Fierce Diety's mask which you can only use when you are fighting a temple boss).The best part of this game is that you can change forms.  You start off the game with Link but are quickly transformed into a Deku Shrub, other forms include the Zora and the Goron.  Though you can also transform into a GIANT Link but only when fighting Twin Mold.  Each transformation mask has its advantages and disadvantages.The Deku Shrub runs fast but cannot swim or go near flames for it will die.  You have about 5 jumps on the water before the shrub falls in and dies.  The shrub can also get to high places where deku flowers lie.The Zora can swim like you won't believe, probably one of the funnest parts is swimming with the Zora.  The Zora cannot run very fast.The Goron is probably the best because you can move really fast with him.  The rolling Goron is so fun, you can roll through the field collecting items and rupees more quickly than with anyone, including Epona.One of the best parts of this game is all the masks that you have to collect to actually beat the game (for you trade in the masks to kids in the moon to get to Majora or the Skull Kid).  All the masks have some importance whether it's an advantage to help Link run faster (the bunny hood) or just to get you a heart piece (the couple's mask).Each temple you have to use a certain mask, for the first you must be the deku shrub for you are cursed and there is NO way of transforming to Link.  A shorter temple but still great in the puzzles.  Snowhead Temple requires some work from the Goron, Great Bay temple requires the Zora and the Stone temple requires mostly Link but you will need the others.A must play and a great Zelda game, the perfect edition to any Nintendo collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"When heroes and villains clash!","reviewText":"When I was growing up back east our local arcade got in a new fighting game full of blood and gore. The game was Mortal Kombat and it changed the way fighting games were played and marketed (as well as founded the ESRB rating system). Now one of the co-creators of Mortal Kombat has stepped into the ring once more and this time with DC characters to bring us Injustice: Gods Among Us. But is this a fighting game that you should pick up or should you dodge it like an incoming fireball?Injustice : Gods Among Us takes place in the DC universe and there is a very deep story in the single player campaign in which the Joker destroys Metropolis and has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane. Superman regains his composure and kills the Joker and decides to establish a new world order and battle lines are drawn as people are siding with Superman's new regime or siding with Batman to take him down. Thus begins the campaign as you progress thru the single player story which is quite compelling and well worth the price of admission.Gameplay is just as fast paced as the original Mortal Kombat games but there are a few upgrades and twists that make it more unique than its predecessor. For one the dreaded block button is gone for good (thank god as I hated using a button to block an attack). All the environments are interactive and depending on who you play as will change how the character interacts with the environment. For example if you were using Batman he could just blow up a car but Superman could pick up the car and smash it over your head.The roster for this game is expansive as there are twenty five characters you can play as in this game. From such greats as Superman , Batman and Wonder Woman to even smaller characters such as Nightwing, Green Arrow  and Shazam. Villains are also represented from the mighty Doomsday and crazy Joker to the twisted Solomon Grundy and methodical Deathstroke. Each of these characters has their own moves, their own special attacks and their own ways of manipulating the environment around them.I have to say that I had my doubts about this game but after playing it for awhile I was very impressed and was thrown back to the early days of Street Fighter II. Where it was all about action and fast paced combat and not worrying about what buttons to press and how to block. Injustice: Gods Among Us is a great game to pick up if you're a DC fan or a fan of fighting games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. H. Johnson","summary":"Love this game!","reviewText":"I have always been a follower of the Resident Evil franchise but I was always too afraid to actually play the game. I bought RE5 hoping to finally play it but it didn't appeal to me, plus it was too scary (IMO) But since RE6 have three different stories and characters I really wanted to suck it up and give it a try. I'm glad I did. I played with a friend so we pretty much blew through the game but it was fun the whole way through.The first story we played was Leon and Helena. This one is by far the scariest. The atmosphere was classic Zombie horror and it was by far the best and longest of the three stories. You see each story is only five chapters and at first I was disappointed with only five but the length of Leon's story more than made up for it. You're battling zombie hordes in dark sewers and so forth and it will throw you right into the story.The second was Chris and Piers. This is more action oriented and with good reason. The B.S.A.A. are now on an all out hunt for the B.O.Ws. So expect more of a military feel to this story. I loved slashing Chris and Piers  and the story was very touching overall. Now I'm sure some would say that it is no longer survival horror and how it is no longer the same RE game as the earlier games. However, I'm personally glad it isn't. Why? Because at this stage in the game the characters should not be taken by surprise and stumbling around like a chicken with their heads cut off. They certainly shouldn't be solving never ending puzzles just to be told that X is a bad guy. The bad guys *should* be more developed than they were in the first games. They really don't have to hide as much anymore. I'm sure that the people complaining about how much the games have changed will also be complaining about them staying the same old thing for six games if they were replaying the same old scenario over and over again.Anyway, The Third story is Jake and Sherry, which is more of an action adventure romp and once again I'm shipping this couple cause they are just so cute together. This story is more about Jake and Sherry on the run.Now as much as I liked this game it does have its flaws. Like, I would have liked it more if Chris and Jake's stories were as long as Leon's. I felt that it was a bit too short. I also would have liked it if Jake and Sherry had more zombie encounters than B.O.W encounters.I felt that it made more sense for Chris to have those encounters but I think the adventure aspects would have been more frightening for those two if it carried the same atmosphere as Leon's story.I hated the low ammo and herb drops but it increased a little after buying the skill. Another thing I hated was that we were never told we had to shoot the blue emblems we saw so we passed up several of those things and only found out while playing Jake's story that we needed to shoot them. I also did not like that certain aspects of the game was designed to make you fail the first time around. For example; Sherry and Jake are riding on a motorcycle and a random truck pull in front causing you to fail the mission. If you didn't expect it to happen and dodge in time you're destined to fail on the first attempt. Also, my partner kept dying during the Chris and Piers story because I was never told that Chris was supposed to crawl over to him.Other than that. The game was good, I loved the interweaving storyline. I loved thinking about what each character was doing while playing another story. The cinematic scenes were well done, the voice acting was top notch. I thought the hair was a bit too glossy, especially Leon and Helena. But I got over it. I loved how the cinematic collection scenes were on a timeline that pieces together each story.I also liked Mercenaries although it would be a lot of fun as a multilayer instead of co-op or at least have a multilayer option. Agent Hunt was fun but it wears thin fast.I'm also not interested in playing the Ada Wong campaign that gets unlocked after finishing the game. I would have liked it more if another part of Leon, Chris, and Jake was open.I highly recommend playing the game to judge for yourself,","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

She would constantly corner me every day so that we could play it over and over, and after we beat it, over and over again.  In fact, I have beaten the original game a total of 10 times with my daughter as my trusty side-kick at the player 2 spot, grabbing stars, freezing bad guys, or shooting the occasional bad guy or gold dot to get me a much needed coin.So imagine our delight when we heard on Amazon.com last June that Super Mario Galaxy 2 was available for pre-order...without a confirmed date, of course, but ready for pre-order nonetheless.Does Super Mario Galaxy 2 hold up?  Does it still manage to capture the heart of a 7-year old girl and her father?  The answer is a resounding YES.Super Mario Galaxy 2 completely operates in its own right by being a stand-alone story.  The only nod to the previous Galaxy comes in the form of Rosalina who will appear if you have significant difficulty with a level so that she can actually show you how to pass a level (at the cost of getting a bronze, NOT gold star).  Back to the story (or the little of it that there is, a la most Mario games), Princess Peach has been kidnapped by a GIGANTIC Bowser (surprise!).  Naturally, Mario is going to rescue her with the help of star power from master luma (star-like creatures with the capability to transform).Who is there to help Mario this time?  Well, this time Luigi is a playable character later on, as opposed to the original Galaxy which forced you to take the torturous path of collecting all 120 stars before unlocking him.  Yoshi is on board as well, your trusty steed who can eat red-hot peppers to move quickly and cross water no less, or become a blimp full of hot air, or glow to reveal hidden paths.The biggest change for us as a father-daughter team is that Player 2 has more to do now.  Player 2 is actually an orange luma who follows Mario around.  Now, Player 2 (in addition to freezing enemies and grabbing stars) can actually spin as well to knock enemies to the ground or grab coins from remote places by flying over to them quickly and then bringing them back to Mario.  Also, making Player 2 an actual, tangible entity in the game (as opposed to a mysterious P2 star that has no discernible presence) makes it even more fun for my daughter who gets caught up in the action because the game itself is usually too hard for her as Player 1.  She will actually say things like, \"Daddy, you get the one on the right, I'll get the one on the left.\"  It's extremely hard to pry her away from it when it's time for a story and bed.Has the gameplay changed much?  Well, no, the same mechanics are there.  It's interesting that the game starts off as a 2D sidescrolling event that leads into somewhat a 3D perspective until it's a full-blown 3D adventure.  It's a subtle, baby-step transition and, as an IGN reviewer put it, it pays off in getting those unfamiliar with the original to get into the action.Despite having the same mechanics of jumping and spinning, Mario has some new powerups.  Cloud Mario can create little tufts of clouds to hop up.  Rock Mario has our hero turning into a solidified boulder to roll around (and even \"bowl\" to hilarious effect).  Drill Mario allows our hero to drill through to inaccessible areas.  And, of course, there's Yoshi who is able to eat his enemies and use a couple of funny power-ups of his own as previously mentioned.  Bee Mario, Fire Mario, Spring Mario, etc., make their return.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is smooth, polished and shows the time-dedicated love and attention that was bestowed upon it during its 3-year absence.  It takes the best parts of the original and makes them better while taking away what didn't work the first time.  They have wisely included more for player 2 to do while acknowledging that Mario is still, front and center, the star of the show.  The music is even more fully orchestrated than before.  The attention to detail is phenomenal and showcases Nintendo's desire to never compromise by releasing a product too quickly without undergoing the rigorous quality control that this game clearly had.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a delight for children and even a delight for me as a 37-year old father.  This is my \"daughter and me\" time, when we share a fun family night (Mommy likes to watch ;D), night-after-night and it is my modern-day Monopoly.  Cheers to Nintendo for taking a winning formula, keeping it more than alive, and breathing fresh ideas into this franchise.So what are you waiting for?

Definitely a surprise purchase.","reviewText":"First of all, if you can subtly ignore all the flaws in this game and focus more on the gameplay and storyline, you'll realize that this game is actually pretty darn good. Very Twin Peaks-like and very odd.  It's like a mixture of X-Files, Twin Peaks and Resident Evil (the controls are very similar). The graphics are outdated and the voice acting is subpar but when you are about 5-6 hours into the game, it lures you in with curiosity.  Each chapter hooked me in wanting to know what was going to happen next.  You kind of get hooked on Agent York.  His oddities and knowledge of idle chatter pertaining to movies grows on you. I've had more fun with this game (at $20 no less)than I've had with most games that I paid $60+ for.  Definitely worth it.  You kind of have to approach this game the same way you would with Wii games. To ignore the little flaws and outdated graphics and focus on the big picture.  Great game.

I wasn't sure what this game plays like from the reviews I've read so I'll let you know now that this game plays a lot like a poor man's Mass Effect 2.  ME2 is one of my favorite games which probably gives me a positive bias toward this one.  You'll choose missions from your safehouse and when complete, you'll return to said safehouse to choose the next one; you have skill modifiers that enhance your abilities during combat; you have good and evil choices to make during dialogue.  All this sound familar?  But where ME2 shines from graphics to storylines to solid controls, Alpha Protocol is sub-par on everything.  You'll play missions solo, and you have the option to attack by stealth or brute force, but the AI is so stupid in this game that you have no need to be stealthy.  Half the time I can just run up to a gun carrying npc and melee them to death.  There are some boss battles in this game that can be summed up as arduous and repetitive, though not too difficult.  I'll be honest and say I had to force myself to play through the first 2 hours of the game because it was so bad and drawn out.  They try to explain every gameplay aspect in the game via a conversation with you and your commander and it was so spoon-fed that I felt like a child being instructed on the game by the developers.

Based on the popular anime series, Afro Samurai will finally let gamers control their favorite samurai as he violently slashes through an eclectic lineup of assassins, ninjas, and robotic thugs..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The voice acting is done by Samuel L.

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Taylor C.

Anytime I'd run across something extremely difficult, I'd still pop the disc in to play earlier stages. I must say I'm surprised that this game didn't get more attention and that they marketed the game solely on the sword. Don't get me wrong, the swordplay makes God Of War feel almost childish, but the real bliss of this game is in the \"aftertouch\" mechanism. Anytime you throw or shoot an object, this gives you the ability to control the movement of that object with the six-axis AND gives you a birds eye view of the movement. It's one of the most addictive additions to any game I've ever played. The graphics and voice acting here are superb. It looks and feels amazing. You also get control of 2 characters throughout, not just the one shown on the box. The other quirky little arrow shooter you get to play with reminds me of Bjork. And I rather like that.

{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Fun But Way Overrated","reviewText":"WARNING! Very very minor spoiler alert.Just finished the game, here's my honest opinion. I might be a bit brutal in some critique but I tend to be very straight forward with my opinions.PROS:- Counter and dodge system was cool, not great, but at least it is implemented.- Having the ability to sneak up on enemies and sniping them from afar is nice. Played Dead Space 3 a few months back and I hated how every creature that drops in automatically goes right to you, which destroyed any attempt in the use of strategy in combat.- I LOVE the level design and pathing in this game. I rarely get lost, even in those \"run for your life\" moments throughout the game. Being lost and frustrated is a major kill joy for me, especially in a shooter like this.- Graphics was pretty decent, but I wasn't especially impressed.- The sound effects, etc are decent.CONS:- Human foes is partially the reason why this game was a bit weak for me. Humans in general are boring. I was hoping for more weird creatures and animals to pop out, they tend to keep you on your feet a lot more and add psychological tension to the game. Humans in this game tend to talk loudly, revealing their location so you never really have to watch out for enemies. Not to mention they're boring to look at. In the beginning there are a few wolves but they all about disappear for the majority of the game.- Cloned enemies everywhere. There's a handful of enemies that are cloned over and over, it's more like Tomb Raider Attack of the Clones.- She finds a lighter and suddenly, we have fire arrows. What the heck?- I think the gore is overdone. It wasn't awesome gore either, it just felt like someone woke up and was desperate to throw body parts, blood and skeletons all over the place in the game. Again, having humans as the mass majority of your enemies also brought the feeling of dread down significantly. The way your human enemies reacted to you and even the plain boring clothes that they wore killed any thoughts of creativity.- Puzzles in this game are boring and weak.- Those caverns/caves and ancient sites are small and a bit boring.- I dunno but hearing her say \"I hate tombs\" when the game is titled Tomb Raider is a bit........- Less Tomb Raider and more typical shooter game.- The combo button mashing was lame. Press X and Y all day long.- The Story is a bit weak. Typical body possession cult mass killing game.- Questions why she didn't kill the leader when she had the chance.........and instead she kills one of his lackeys right next to him instead. Guess we gotta drag the game out.- The enemies had no diversity. They all go after you, they have no individualism, anything that can add depth or surprise to the game. Again, it feels very much like you're being attacked by mindless clones.- What's the point in collecting useless artifacts or doing a 100% completion if I can just breeze through the game and just beat it and play another game? There's no drive for me to find everything.- The environment and game props overall are nice but the issue is that they've been seen before in other games and so it just looks boring to look at since if you're not fighting enemies, you'll be concentrating on the environment and the environment is nice but boring at the same time.Game is alright, some scenes are pretty neat, but there's almost zero replay value. It's a typical shooter game with boring human enemies that require little strategy or rather I say, UNIQUE strategies to defeat and stuff that needs to be collected that really didn't do anything to the actual game therefore why collect them?1 out of 10.....I'd give this a 7.Games have been so disappointing for awhile. Been ages since I played a game that had a meaningful plot, storyline, dynamic characters and enemies with unique and interesting personalities, etc.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"merrly hill","summary":"Awesome action game, blows Gears Of War out of the water!","reviewText":"This game is awesome, love the controls camera angles and everything.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"\"fillandros\"","summary":"A good challenge but....","reviewText":"This is a fun challenge, but this game has waaaaay more cons than pros. but i like it anyway [i dont know why].

I know... I just wanted to be able to play games on my computer rather than a dedicated box.  WinXP with 1-2 gigs of RAM and low end video cards simply wasn't enough to make me want to be involved.  I recently bought a new computer with an i7 core processor and 12 gigs of addressable RAM under Vista 64 and a stand alone 512MB ATI Radeon HD 4850 video card.  Not top of the line, but very workable.  I decided I wanted a game that was recent, used a lot of processor capability, and was not just a shoot em up.  I wanted time to explore a world.Fallout 3 is that game.  I can explore.  I can shoot em up.  I can complete quests-- or not.  I can interact with characters -- or not.  It is a huge world... and with hundreds of hours of play time, there is no need to finish the main quest too quickly.  I backed out of the main quest after seeing all the endings and have been exploring the rest of the world.  As you get experience up, the game becomes more manageable--you learn what weapons you want and need, when to use them, and how far back you need to be (fat man mini nukes!).I like the bartering, the weapons, and exploration aspects of the game.  The perks are fun to choose. The game gets more fun and addictive the more you play it.The graphics on my system were spectacular.  I played it on my lower end lap top, and found the depth was greatly reduced.  I have had some freeze-ups, but nothing frequent... easily restarted.For a game with 100's of hours of play-time, the downfall is that things can and do get repetitive.  Buildings, vaults, subways and factories are the same mazes.  They flow naturally most of the time, but sometimes, like a rat I felt trapped.  Same for the multitudes of creatures... they react the same every time... supposedly this changes if you are in a different karma, but I have not tried all the possibilities.Conversation is OK, but pretty one dimensional with nice, neutral, and somewhat nasty being predominantly available.This is not a shoot 'em up, although if you want that you can find it in this game--it is just not a continuous fight.Recently I started using a couple of \"cheats\"--which are easy to find on line.  Adding ammo, improving weapon condition, etc.... I was surprised I was having even more fun after completing much of the game.So if you are looking for an open ended FPS, multiple hours of gameplay, and a variety of play options... give Fallout 3 a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

Rool and his vast army of Kremlings. The incredible Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM) graphics in this game have been specially optimized for the Game Boy. If you play this game with the Super Game Boy accessory for the Super NES, you'll have access to specially selected color palettes and custom border graphics.As the story begins, K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong, and he's demanding the entire Banana Hoard as ransom. It's up to Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong to rescue their kidnapped pal. A wild assortment of friendly animals like Rambi the Rhino, Squitter the Spider, Squawks the Parrot, Rattly the Rattlesnake, and Enguarde the Swordfish help the two little monkeys in their adventurous mission through over 40 levels. Each exciting area is filled with special traps, hidden items, and dastardly Kremlings.People who have playedDonkey Kong Country 2on the Super NES will recognize many of the elements of this game.

Being a fan of the original Donkey Kong Country, I loved its amazing sequal.The plot: DK gets kidnapped by K.Rool.  It's up to Diddy and Dixie to save him now.  You have eight worlds to traverse to, amazing environments to get through, and dozens of baddies to stomp.  Classic DK country.How about the graphics...probably the best I've seen for the SNES; the paralax scrolling is maginificent.  On pirate ship levels, the water in the background is 3-dimensional and scrolls at different paces.  The graphics are very clear and vivid, and really bring out the sharpness in the game.  This game has adopted the theme of pirates; remember all the kremlings in DKC 1?  Now they all have pirate clothing and peglegs and stuff.Speaking of kremlings, let's run through the bestiary.  From hopping kremlings to invincible zingers (bees), the enemy range is very wide; each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses.  One particualr kremling dual-wields two swords, and is only vulnerable when he gets them stuck in the ground.  There are also different colored variations of enemies; the pink version of this kremling has his swirds stuck in the ground for a much shorter amount of time, so it's tougher to kill him.Level design--this is an amazing part; there is so much diversity of stages in the game, it's not even funny.  There are carnival stages where you're on a roller coaster trying to dodge closing gates, there is a giant haunted mansion where fifty-foot ghosts chase you down while you're driving a rusty old minecart, and there are levels in which you are underwater.  Did you think there were only these level types?  Guess again: pirate ships, ship sails, lava, boiling water levels, giant towers with toxic water following you up, sunken sea ships, forests of thorn bushes, etc.  I could go on and on.The music is amazing.  The theme of the bramble forest levels is particularly awesome to listen to while you're playing; I sometimes pause the game just to listen to that song play.  Or you could listen to the mysterious tune of the gloomy gulch stages, which are also cool.Even if you beat this game, there is still plenty more to do: collect all the DK coins.  Collect all the Bonus game coins.  Comlete World 8: The Lost World.  This game will never have you bored.As far as difficulty goes, this game has got it all; the first level?  A baby could do it.  However, there is a level near the end of the game called \"Toxic Tower,\" in which intoxicated water floods the inside of a tower while you struggle to climb up and up and up away from it.  All in all, the more worlds you master, the tougher the levels are.And now for some hints:--On the map screen, when your character is standing on a level, its name will appear.  If there is an exclamation point next to the level name, it means you have all the Bonus coins there.  If there's a DK symbol, then you've found the DK coin.--Collect banana coins!  Use them to save your game at Wrinkly Kong's house, to ask for secret gameplay hints from Cranky (which are VERY handy) and to warp to worlds that you've previously visited in Funky's Flights, or to compete in Swanky's minigames to earn extra lives.The fun never stops!  If you have an SNES, get this game.  If you don't, then buy the system and this game.  You'll regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2005"}

A couple printed pages and you're good to go.Now some caveats, these games are from the late 80's early 90's, and the graphics/music are representative of the era.  Some look decent, some are looking a little worse for wear.  If you are accustomed to post PS2/Xbox graphics, picking up this might seem like a terrible idea.But, if warm fuzzies are generated just by hearing the old \"Say-ga\" on console startup, then this package is for you.  Highly recommeded.  (Four stars for fun only because the older controls can require some \"reacquainting\").Last note, when entering codes, it appears that the button mapping is:A = TriangleB = Square / CircleC = X","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Trevor Cotton","summary":"Another great final fantasy title","reviewText":"A lot of people gave FFVIII bad press when it came out, and I can still see bad reviews here now, I have no idea why.  Comparisons to FFVII are obviously going to be made, in my opinion it falls marginally short of VII, but only slightly, not as much as some people suggest, it is still one of the greatest games ever.Where it falls short of VII is the plot, which just isn't as good, mainly because you dont meet the final boss until the very end of the game (also a criticism of IX).  She really has little to do with the game until the closing hours, and it could have been thought out a little better.  As for the main character Squall, he is a little stereotypical for the genre, an angst ridden teenager, with many personal issues, not original but it still works.  These are only minor criticisms and on the whole this game, like its predecessor, is amazing.It is longer than FFVII, it will probably take you at least 60 hours to complete this, and thats ignoring the many distractions on offer.  The best sub-plot/game is definetely Triple Triad the card game, which is genious.  I wasted at least 10 hours on this alone, and on my second time playing through the game, i completed the collection, which was hard work but very satisfying if you have the time.  Everything about this game is class, the locations, the characters, the new junctioning system, everything!  I have heard a few people say the junctioning system is too complicated, but it isn't really.  It can seem like overload at first, but once you have the hang of it, it works really well.  There are also secret bosses, like in all FF's, I defeated both Ultima and Omega Weapons (after a very drawn out battle).  There is so much to see and do here, like most of the games in the series it is a masterpiece, very highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

Drop $60 on Oblivion.  Then drop another $60 on Microsoft Points for the rest of the content.This sadly is going to be a growing trend.  You will pay more for the games, but have more and more of the content be put up as marketplace downloads for an additional fee.  Don't like it.

This one is definitely a miss.It started out so promising.  The first chapter was awesome.  Just what I expected and wanted.  The graphics were incredible; the storyline was interesting, but still had a decidedly Castlevania feel to it.  Then it all fell apart.  The storyline was predictable and, in my opinion, just plain stupid.  The characters were irritating (why does everyone need to have an accent?)  The gameplay was terrible.  Many times I would get stuck on an invisible ledge or wedge myself just offscreen.  And there were instances in which I spent too long trying to figure out where the @%*# I'm supposed to go now!  (Oh, it's that little ledge that I can't see from this angle)  The controls were inconsistent; sometimes you pressed down to drop, other times you had press X.  The game necessitated delicate movements, the controls were anything but.  The puzzles were way too easy.  Helen Keller could have completed them.  Lords of Shadow played like a crappy God of War.The beginning CGI scene was fantastic.  The ending CGI scene was good.  In between was bad.  Poor storyline, too easy puzzles, distracted gameplay.  I blame the game testers for not giving adequate feedback to the developers.I've already sold my copy of this game, and I certainly won't be buying the sequel.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2011"}

For the most part they pulled it off nicely. Though you began the game normal you had to find four capsules, each one with an upgrade for your body. The leg part would let you dash short distances and jump further. The helmet part allowed you to break certain surfaces with your head. The body part allowed you to withstand twice as much damage. And the arm part let you charge your blaster to a fourth level of damage. Also, you begin this game with a very small life meter. You must find the heart tanks (one is in each of the eight stages) to make it larger. Instead of energy tanks, you now have sub tanks (which you must fill yourself (with surplus energy.)) Also, completing certain stages will alter others. If you beat Chill Penguin's stage, Flame Mammoth's fire factory will have frozen over. If you beat Storm Eagle's stage, the wreckage of his flying machine will destroy the electricity generation in Spark Mandrill's stage. If you beat Launch Octopus, the underground of Sting Chameleon's stage will flood. Being a totally new series, this takes place approximately 100 years after the most recent game in the classic Mega Man series.The story goes something like this: X, a new breed of robot who can think and make decisions on his own, was unearthed from the remains of an ancient laboratory by Dr. Cain. Fascinated by X, Cain produced his own series of these robots, ignoring the risks. Several of them became Mavericks and began disobeying human orders. To counter this, Cain built Maverick Hunter robots, led by the ultra-powerful Sigma. Unfortunately, after Sigma battled a mysterious red robot called ZERO, he too became a Maverick, bringing Cain's worst fears to life. Oddly enough, Zero went back to normal and joined X. Together they set out to destroy all of the Maverick bots. Unfortunately, Zero was destroyed in action, forcing X to continue alone. Once he ultimately stopped Sigma, he realized the battle was only beginning. It would be continued in future Mega Man X games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2002"}

The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Not the same","reviewText":"The third installment to the Silent Hill series has caused mixed feelings in fans around the world, most of which have made positive remarks. I stand to differ. Although this Silent Hill is great in its own rite, it is incomparable with the first two and, with me at least, has brought much disappointment.The first game was a major success because it was revolutionary and terrified video game players when everyone thought Resident Evil was as terrifying as it could get. The second game was greater because we knew what to expect and wanted to return to Silent Hill to see what horrors it would deliver and what fears it could conjure up this time. But the third game....yes, this one; it meets with some disappointment because this time, the players don't visit Silent Hill until the very end and don't explore the town once they finally get there.Put me back in that town that mortified me the first two times. Let me be witness to some strange, awful looking creatures emerging from the thick fog. Let me feel that overwhelming sense of desolation and loneliness. I don't want it all to change. It was good the first time; it worked the first time; it scared you the first time. The first two games were not about fighting bigger, more furious creatures; they were all about atmosphere. You could not help feeling like the further you walked down a deserted street, the closer you were coming upon some nameless, unknown peril. I did not feel anything like that when playing this game. I simply felt that, \"Okay, when I open this next door, be ready to run into some corner and make some distance for myself and shoot and kill.\" That was as far as the fear went. Silent Hill, the actual TOWN, has built itself up a solid reputation of being an extremely evil place which can reach right down into the very core of your soul and pull out any of your personal, hidden fears and give to them life. The name Silent Hill alone conjures up old feelings of being enveloped by a nameless, formless evil. So sure, new and bigger creatures are fine to add, but they are scarier if we know where they come from, not just throwing them at us. It's about ATMOSPHERE, not bigger and stranger creatures, and the town Silent Hill is by far the most horrifying atmospheric place that has ever been introduced in a video game.So, why did you take it away?I hope with this next installment, Silent Hill 5, the producers will do everyone a favor and put us BACK to the place which won them worldwide attention and made them rich.Other than the fact you see little to no Silent Hill in this Silent Hill game...gameplay is still highly anticipating. You still have the radio and it is still very dark and a flashlight is required to see. The new monsters are stranger than before and the music score was excellent.

If you go on any reputable gaming site and find a top 10 list of FPS games of all time, I guarantee the majority of the games will be made for PC. There is a reason for this - they have features in them that have been perfected over the years since the original Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Over these years the FPS genre has evolved and standards have been set. These are like \"unwritten rules\" for FPS development. I can understand wanting change, after all, change can be good. For this reason, I must give IW (Infinity Ward, the developers of this game) some credit.You see, they decided to experiment with Modern Warfare 2 and try to make it more like a console game. Before the game was released, many PC gamers rejected it because of lack of dedicated servers. Dedicated servers have been in FPS games forever and until home users can buy epically fast Internet connections there's no reason to have games hosted on individual player's computers/systems. This is why every FPS game has dedicated servers. Many PC gamers, via Twitter, forums etc tried to tell Infinity Ward this, but unfortunately they didn't listen. As a result, 4 out of 5 games you get into whilst playing the multiplayer for this game, you will either experience lag or hackers or even both. If this game had dedicated servers, lag would significantly be reduced, servers admins would be able to ban cheaters. It's also worth noting that this game uses VAC instead of PunkBuster. PunkBuster is a much better anti-cheat system when implemented properly. So thank you to Infinity Ward for reminding us that dedicated servers are better than peer to peer hosting. I hope other game developers learn from this.If you do end up playing the multiplayer, the best way to get kills is to be as lame as possible. For example, the tubes. I wouldn't mind tubes if the damage they did was reduced. It's too easy too use them, hence why they are nicknamed \"n00b tubes\". All you do is simply point in the direction of your enemy and click. You don't need skill to use them. You don't need skill to knife either. In many FPS games, the knife or similar melee attack is a backup weapon, for when you are in a pinch, can't reload or have no ammo left. In Modern Warfare 2, it's role is a primary weapon, which isn't the way it's supposed to be. Why spend time aiming for someone's head, when you can just press one button and get an instant kill? This game does NOT reward skill at all!The game is also somewhat schizophrenic in that it can't decided if it wants to be a realistic military shooter or an arcade game. I realize it can be hard to strike a balance between realism and fun, but MW2 tries to mix two extremes together and fails. For example, for realism you'd hold your breath to steady your scope. This is fine, especially if the game was slower paced, but then it turns around and includes things like \"perks\". Perks are similar to power ups, some enhance your weapons and others make you sprint for longer etc. Power ups belong in games like Quake 3, Unreal Tournament etc, not a realistic shooter.Movement is also an essential part of the game. The movement feels clunky and it takes too long to do things. For example, if you swing your knife and then try to shoot, it takes forever to finally pull your gun back out and shoot. If you are new to FPS games, you probably won't notice the delay, but it's incredibly frustrating and pointless. It's not real, it's a game and it should feel like one. Another reason to believe this was made for console/casual gamers is that you have to climb over a wall. 99% of FPS gamers, unless they are severely disabled or are using a gamepad know how to crouch jump. I don't need the game to tell me to press space, then put my gun away for two seconds whilst I have no control over my character as he climbs over a wall. I can jump myself!There are so many things wrong with the multiplayer it would be too long to list them all here. There are (if only a few) good things about this game. The XP and leveling system is great. It rewards you trying out different weapons and items and this makes for a great way to learn your favorites. The weapons are also good too, each one has a different feel to them and they all have their own characteristics that make them unique. They also have many attachments which guarantee that you'll find some combination's you'll like.The singleplayer isn't that great either. The singleplayer involves you getting from point A to B whilst the game spawns waves and waves and waves of enemies at you. The only way to stop this, is to find a break in the action, move up to the next point where, once again, the game will spawn more waves and waves and waves of enemies. This is mind numbingly repetitive and designed to impress little console kiddies with too much Kool-Aid in their system.The Co-Op however is a slightly different story. It's actually a lot of fun to go through it with a friend and is probably the better part of the game. It's a shame there aren't many more levels for this. Speaking of which, the add-on content isn't great either. I don't just mean the DLC (which you have to pay for, not worth it). I'm also referring to the lack of MOD support. It's been almost a year since MW2 came out and already it's going to be replaced by many (that can afford to, of course) by the next game in the series, Black Ops. Why will MW2 be boring and outdated in about a month's time? Black Ops? New Medal of Honor? No. The reason is lack of MOD support or map making tools. This is one of the reasons games like Half Life, Counter Strike, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament last longer than a year. These games are platforms for bedroom nerds and small game studios to experiment and bring something meaningful to the community. Instead, IW and Activision opted for a cash cow.Considering everything I just said, if you are considering buying this game, my advice to you is don't. There are much better games coming out soon and this game will soon be forgotten or regarded as \"just another FPS\". You will NEVER see this game in a top 10 FPS games of all time list on ANY gaming site. Even as a fan of this genre, I'd have to give this game a 6.5/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"Xebec51","summary":"Enter Age of Empires 3...","reviewText":"We'll it might as well be called that.

The Perfect Shot is ideal for shooting games on the Wii and is fully compatible with all software designed for the Wii Zapper. The Perfect Shot is designed for one handed operation, giving a pistol-like grip for all your shooting games. The accessory pass-through port also allows for use of Nunchuks and other accessories while the Wii Remote is docked in the Perfect Shot. The tactile trigger also provides a smooth, natural activation of the B-button for less hand strain.","reviewerName":"Hongster","summary":"Best Wii Gun","reviewText":"I own the product (unlike the other reviewer) so let me tell you that this is the Wii gun peripheral that has set the standard as the highest in it's class.  The Zapper is plagued by it's design to be held with 2 hands to shoot, while this gun can be held with just one hand and you have the option of plugging in the nunchucks for games that require it.  When testing the game with Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, it is very easy to aim with and the game feels much more fun with the gun (in my opinion this is how Resident Evil:UC was meant to be played).  The remote slides in and it is held in place so you don't have to worry about the remote slipping off.  For those wondering, there is no slot for the nunchuck (like the Zapper) only a slot for you to connect it so that you can hold onto it with your other hand.  It feels like your holding a real gun and it has a sturdy feel to it (of course the color scheme might not represent a real gun, but guess that's a minor drawback and really I think the color scheme is fine as it matches with the Wii). Also this is priced fairly when compared to other guns available and the other guns are not as good as you can tell from the reviews (exception would be the Zapper since it does come with a game).I recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a Zapper yet (or for those who have a Zapper and is looking to upgrade or is in need of another gun for multi-player) and has the following games: Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles or Ghost Squad and any upcoming games such as House of the Dead 2 & 3 and/or any shooting game supporting the Zapper (not recommended for any other games such as Metroid Prime 3)Note: The gun features a spring kick back (which is non existent in the Zapper).  This feature is important as you can fire more rapidly.  Before putting your remote in make sure you take off the wrist strap as it will not fit.  Not recommended for game play sessions over 1 hour as your trigger finger will get tired.Update: Any games that are compatible with the Zapper will use the 'Z' button on the nunchuck instead of pressing 'A'.  For those wondering this does not mean you can play Resident Evil 4 or Metroid Prime 3 with the Perfect Shot as it is not \"Zapper Compatible\" (please check the back of any game box to make sure the game is Zapper compatible or not).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

All around you are the endless shades of night, and you, unaware of anything save a crippled ship and the task before you, step inside to take a little looksy.A few minutes later that little look turns out to be one of the worst decisions you've ever made in your life.From the beginning, Dead Space is one of those games that get under your skin. The sights are beautiful and the sounds are horrific in only the best of ways, leading you to jump when the game wants you to jump and to panic when it asks you to panic. This means it wraps you around its little pixilated finger, asks you to marry it, and you can't help but say yes. Really, how could you? Graphically, it is a love affair that just keeps getting better and those are the best kinds.Weapon-wise, the game is lovely as well, because you get a number of weapons to play with AND because you gain abilities as you move through the game. The weapons are upgradeable as well AND can be adjusted to shoot in different configurations, making them more valuable as you move forward. You get the basic set-up stuff (power, reload, capacity, and some other odds-and-ends depending on the blaster), and these basics allow each weapon to stay in play long than you would think. The abilities are lovely as well - you get things that allow you to slow time somewhat, the ability to telekinetically grab things and throw them around, and those are only starter toys. I personally like that.I also like the little touches that are done with health and with abilities. The suit you are wearing has colors that display how much of something you have, allowing you to see your health without an ugly bar cluttering the screen. You also have a map feature that is projected into the air, and this allows a better way to examine the map than previous flat variations.All of this leads, of course, to conflicts with things that are a tad intimidating and sometimes overwhelming. They move FAST when they want to, can tear into you with ease as soon as you think you have things under control, and they don't exactly die when you ask them to die. Taking a head still leaves a body, taking an arm leaves other limbs, taking a leg still leaves a beastie with a bad attitude, taking - you get the picture. They hide well too, reminding me a little the type of friends Colonial Marines seemed to make. The fights are lovely things as well : one firefight in zero-gravity makes you wonder why you haven't been popping off rounds like that all of your life.As far as the negative reviews that have been popping up in magazines, pay them little heed. All horror games (with the exception of some Resident Evil titles) have always been underappreciated, and low scoring comes with the world of fighting terrors. I've often wondered if magazines find the games a tad bit difficult for weak bladders accustomed to playing the same drab titles over and over again, or if it is something personal that we do not know about. Regardless, this is one title that is a MUST BUY for the 360 and delivers on all fronts.I cannot give it more acclaim than I am now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

Well, today's your lucky day !","reviewText":"When Grand Theft Auto released on the original PlayStation, it has proven to be one of the best landmark titles of the PlayStation game console. This is probably the first videogame series that allows you to play as the criminal, where you get to carjack, do sneak attacks and murder innocent civilians. Adults find the GTA series offensive and grotesque. They don't see it fitting to find their children shooting people at point-blank range with an AK-47. But you don't see some of us fans get influenced by the game itself. I already know some people are influenced by it, and whoever is already influenced by the game is a total idiot who actually took their killing abilities from a videogame. How stupid is that ? Anyway let's get back to the topic. Finally this year in 2001, Rockstar Games released yet another stunning addition to the Grand Theft Auto series known as Grand Theft Auto 3. This game turned out to be one of the best lookin PlayStation 2 games of the year. Not to mention, best playing game ever. So far, most people gave this a high score. Probably a 10 or a 5, but some people gave it one star because of the explict violence. Another reviewer said that this game was too violent. (coughing)WUSSY! (ahem) Yeah...anyway...he gave the game 1 star. And what's worse, he gave Metal Gear Solid 2 only two stars. Probably because it's an &quot;M&quot; rated game. Yeah sure, why don't you give all of the &quot;M&quot; rated games a bad score like Doom or Unreal Tournament. But 1 STAR ON GTA3!? What the feesyz? But who cares what he says, in fact, who cares what anyone else says? It only matters what I say, and I say it's a damn good game. Thats all there is to it ! The graphics are sweet-lookin. Now for the first time, you won't have to go through the pressures of going through the game with a helicopter camera view. You have a wide variety of cameras to choose from. Whether its a 3rd person view or a driveby side view, it's up to you. The character models are perfectly rendered, but sometimes they appear to be a bit blocky on some edges, but all in all, the texture looks great. The music may be a little forgetable, but most tracks are pretty well known. From punk-rock, techno, rap, and classical music. The voice acting is average. The dialogue on each scene sounds like you're watching an &quot;R&quot; rated movie which is great. But unfortunately some in-game voice acting sounds weird. Some people would say the exact same thing to each other (man that's annoying) and the next thing you know, they'll either beat the living crud out of them or bust a few caps on them until they're dead. The gunshots, car crashes, and explosions sound very realistic unlike some of the early GTA series. The gameplay is downright the best in the game, and it improved over the other GTA titles. The controls are seamless and they don't seem to bother me that much. Even the car control doesn't seem that bad at all. The only in-game flaw is the over-difficult missions that we had to go through. Now that's one thing that will get to me. But I'm not taking down one star just because of that. So in the end, Grand Theft Auto 3 is far by, the best amont the GTA series today. But a little warning for you kiddies out there. This game is only reccomended for gamers at the ages of 17 or older, so I wouldn't reccomend it to younger audiences. If you ain't 17, I suggest you stick to &quot;E&quot; or &quot;T&quot; rated games like Street Fighter III or something like that. But if you're at the age where you can possibly buy any damn thing you want, get Grand Theft Auto 3 for the PlayStation 2, but a word of advice before you do. Please don't get influenced by the game itself. If you wan't Rockstar Games to continue on the GTA series, please do them a favor and don't pull of anything stupid like carjack or go on a killing spree.

I hope Resistance 2 to be a little more solid on this aspects.Anyway the game is really good, loads of fun and have a great story line.Scenarios could be tad boring cause they are all very similar I can`t see the difference between London and Oxford other than the snow LOL.The game pays itself for the multiplayer option so go for it you wont regret it, its already a PS3 classic and goes for a decent price!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2008"}

Unlike the first one, which was a top view adventure game, this game shifts genres to an RPG with side scrolling combat and dungeons. For its time it was quite innovative, and in some ways helped lay the foundation for future role playing games. However, as a Zelda game it just wasn't quite the game that a lot of fans were hoping for. It's still a good game though, and it's a must have for any NES collection.

The day the video game world was changed forever. Sega launched its Sega Dreamcast which had graphics far superior to anything else availible. It also had internet capability to play games over the net and could also play music CD's. The Dreamcast was very succesful in its first weeks on the market, selling more than 500,000 in its first week.But in January 2001 Sgea announced that due to low world-wide sales they would stop producig the Dreamcast and become a 3rd party developer for the other systems, never to make another Dreamcast system or any other system again. Thankfully, Sega would still support the Dreamcast until March 2002. In between those times is when the best Dreamcast games were released. NFL 2K2, NBA 2K2, NHL 2K2, Daytona USA, Crazy Taxi2 and Sonic Adventure 2 were all released between those lines. But here March 2002 has come and gone and the Dreamcast has passed on with the release of NHL 2K2.But that does not mean an any way that you should not buy a Dreamcast. You can get a dreamcast, 2 controllers, a memory card, NHL 2K2, NFL 2K2, NBA 2K2 Sonic Adventure 2, Shennmue, Daytona USA, Crazy Taxi 2 and 5 other games for the same price of a PS2 or XBOX, one controller, one memory card, and no games.The Dreamcast is a great deal at $50 and you can't go wrong with any games. I think the Dreamcast is the best deal on a video game system availible right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2002"}

It started out so right, it seemed Sega was going to be able to fix the errors of years past, make the comback that they deserved, and reclaim their title as king of the arcade. With launch titles such as Sonic Adventure, Soul Calibur, Crazy Taxi, it seemed almost too good to be true. It had revolutionary features. The VMU was the first, which was a handheld system and memory card that provided a LCD screen for the controller, that changed based on game and context. Next was the built in modem, it allowed not only internet access and web browsing straight out of the box, but also supported online play, a first for consoles. It had the first MMO, phantasy star online, free to play. But it also had other games that were amazing, Project Seaman, with its voice recognition through the microphone, Jet Grind Radio, which was the first to feature cell shaded graphics, Shenmue was the first to feature a massive open ended world, and the countless acade perfect ports of games like Marvel vs. Capcom 1+2, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Hydro Thunder. It was the last Japanese and Arcade based system. It had everything a  gamer could ever want, it was affordable, reliable, inovative, connected, revolutionary, powerful, and had a massive library of games from every genre. It had core and casual games, single and multiplayer, and had online and offline games. Its such a shame that Sega made all the right moves but no one cared. If you conisder yourself a core gamer, you owe it to yourself to look at this system one more time.Farewell Dreamcast you are missed, you may be dead, but your games live on.Rest in peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

But one thing that continues to evolve is the difficulty. Before buying this game, make sure you can handle not hitting the ball. To make matters worse I had to change the difficulty to \"rookie\" in order to have a chance. I admit, with any game, it takes practice. But seriously, hitting the ball should not be this hard. Thank goodness you can adjust the difficulty and adjust the sliders too. But if you don't mind lowering the difficulty, expect a wonderful game experience. While 2K's game is better this year, it's nowhere's near as good as The Show. While there is not huge upgrades from last year, any fan of MLB can't go wrong with this game. The graphics, the tight gameplay are still the best in the business.Online seems to play a lot smoother too. To get the most fun out of this game, I suggest playing a friend or going online. When you go online, you can download a ton of classic stadiums from the past, which is also a nice addition.MLB The Show 10 is not a huge upgrade from 09. There are minor tweaks in the graphics I see and the gameplay seems a bit more polished and obviously you get the new rosters. I still notice clipping issues here and there. On many instances I saw the baserunners body go completely through the taggers body, it looks really bad at times, I wish they would have addressed it. And unless you're planning on losing every game, you might want to adjust the batting difficulty and put it on rookie.

Too bad about the install issues I listed in the original review.  This woulda been a 4 or 5 star rating for the campaign play.Original review:  I needed to get this review up right away to hopefully save others great frustration. Before you put the disc in your PS3 for the first time, disconnect from the Internet and DO NOT do the update. Only after the game has been installed should you attempt any updates. If you attempt to do the update right from the start along with the initial instal (as the pop up screen will ask you to do upon initial start-up) you may run into some very severe issues. I did as have many others. Google it. It can cause the game to not play and freeze on a black screen and then take several hours to delete the bad patch. So, just remember to disconnect from the web first. Then install the game. Then reconnect to the web and do any updates. You will be glad you did.If you did not have this problem, good for you. I did and so did many others. Like I said, google it.I have been playing the game for a couple of hours now. About half as much time as it took to deal with the install issues. Game seems fine. I don't imagine it sucking. However, it can never get better than 3 stars from me given the terrible software issue upon install. It was just rediculous.

I have played the first one time and time again, and I still love it.  Yet the second one has drastically devolved from the first game.The thing that made Star Wars Battlefront so amazing was the fact that the player could do anything; you could choose which command posts to take, you could choose your character class, etc.  You could choose whether or not you wanted to destroy the shield bunker on Endor.  You could choose whether or not you wanted to blow up all three techno union ships on Geonosis.  Battlefront 2 completely takes this feeling away.  Now you have to do objectives in a certain order, going from one place to the next in an organized sequence.  You cannot move freely from one command post to another.  You do everything you are told, and that is one of the major flaws in Battlefront 2.What's worse: on campaign mode, you're timed!  That's right; you have a certain time to complete each map and go to the next.  This is one of the lamest things in the game.  Again: it removes the ability to move freely on the battlefield.  This timing nuisance and the objectives are what have influenced me to remove a star from the game's overall rating.Another star is lost because of the character classes.  I liked using the diverse characters in Battlefront 1.  When i was playing as the Rebels, I always used the wookie smuggler, because of the cool bowcaster weapon, its special grenade launcher, and the time bombs you could use to strategically take out bases and vehicles.  When I was the empire, I used two classes: the dark trooper and the imperial pilot.  The Dark Trooper was special because he could super-jump, and he had a wide-range blast cannon.  The imperial pilot was especially difficult to use because the mortar launcher required good precision, and he also could fix machines and could drop health and ammo canisters.I also like the droid pilot for the same reason.  And as for the Republic, I always used the jet trooper, because he could fly and launch EMP's.  All these character classes were not only unique, but very balanced and are only effective if used in the right hands.Yeah...about that...you cannot use ANY of those in Battefront 2 unless you unlcok them by achieving a set amount of goals (like kills, etc.) in a map.  You only start out with the same borng classes for every army, like the standard trooper, the sniper, the rocket launcher-carrier, and a new class that repairs vehicles.  You have to \"unlock\" all special classes in order to use them, even though they were already great and fun to use when you started with them in the first game.  You know the saying--\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"Also, might I add--you cannot see enough on the screen.  The target reticle for EVERY weapon in the game is too big and takes up too much space on the TV screen.However, there were a few things I did like about the game--the fact that you could play \"Hunt\" mode and use the wampas to kill all the rebels, and the fact that you can be in space battles.  The new classes are pretty cool as well.  These are what probably contributed to enjoyable parts of the game.  Heck, maybe I'll give this game another chance.  But one thing's for sure: it isn't as good as the first one, and it never will be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2006"}

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

The characters from the movie are well made for this game.  The game play was decent.  The many complaints I have about it though is it repeats itself.  You're basically doing the same old thing all through the game besides completing missions, which is extorting businesses and taking over rival families.  After you've completed the missions it's basically boring.  The game just isn't made good.  I wish the creators of the game would've put more heart into the game.  It needed to be more historically accurate in terms of the mafia in real life.  The cars in this game drives way too fast for a car back in the 30's/40's and they all look the same.  Cars back then were all unique and not the same old boring vehicles we have today.  I don't know, this is just my outlook on the game.  You be the judge.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2014"}

Choose from heroes like Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Elektra, to form and customize a four-member strike force.","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"Lives up to its title!","reviewText":"I am having an absolute blast with this game.  It combines old-school arcade beat-em-up madness with RPGish character advancement, a fantastic story, and let us not forget a roster of some 140 classic Marvel comics characters, 24 or so playable.  Then, of course, there is the much-hyped option of creating and naming your own superhero dream team.  You start out with four heroes of your choice and the more you team these characters up on missions, the more experience and prestige your team gains.  This leads you to upgrade your mighty force with great stat bonuses and an expanded roster.  Cool, cool stuff if you're a fan of comics or superheroes in general. If you're a wise gamer, you can send  any of several Avengers line-ups, the X-men, or the Fantastic Four along with a few other \"secret\" combos into battle together and receive special team bonuses as a reward.  There are also some awesome sequences where your team all use their \"extreme\" powers at once.  Picture this:  Blade throws several vials of his serum into the air, shooting them so they explode into a deadly mist that damages the enemies, Spiderman then swings across the screen blasting every foe with webbing and ensnaring them as they are still recoiling from Blade's assault, Deadpool leaps into the air, flipping sideways in slow motion as he sprays the villains (now ensnared in webbing) with twin SMG's just as the Human Torch starts raining fire and Brimstone over the whole screen.  That, my friends, is some hardcore superhero a**-kicking.The story will take you throughout the Marvel Universe to other galaxies, under the sea, to the realm of the gods fo Asgard, and even to the depths of Mephisto's hellish underworld as you battle the Masters of Evil, an ambitious coalition of supervillains headed by Dr. Doom himself.  The extra missions you complete (or don't) during the course of your journeys will all affect the game's ending; so though you may have saved the universe, depending on what side missions you did or didn't complete you are shown the future that has been created by your actions or lack thereof.  My first time through, for example, I did much good and brought peace between some former enemies of humanity and helped defeat many future threats, but the combination of events that came about because of some details I neglected during gameplay doomed some of my favorite heroes of all in the end.  I've never seen a story mode handled quite like this and it's very rewarding and really adds to the replay value of the game.  All right, on to the characters.  It would have been nice to play as the Namor, the Vision, or [insert your favorite obscure Marvel hero here], but the playable roster is an impressive combination of legendary mainstays like Spiderman, Wolverine, and Iron Man and hardcore fan-pleasers like Dr. Strange, Moon Knight, and the aforementioned merc with the mouth, Deadpool.  Heck, even the cosmic power of the Silver Surfer is yours to command so who's to complain?  Furthermore, you now have the option of downloading even more characters from xbox live including Venom, Magneto, and the Hulk as well as 5 others.  There are tons of legendary Marvel villains and heroes that are MIA (no Punisher?  Doh!), and some minor fanboy complaints about the upgradeable uniforms (why is Spidey's symbiote costume less powerful than his original cloth one?), but that just means that there is still room for this awesome franchise to get even better next time around.Fans of the \"X-men Legends\" games will find the gameplay more than a little familiar (see: nearly identical) and will find some favorite characters from those games playable as well, but with some new tricks.  You gotta love Colossus picking up enemies and using them to club their comrades; that's just good times all around.  There are also interactive segments, mini-games if you will, that are pretty fun and look cool as hell.  Running over psychotic clowns in a bumper car springs immediately to mind; and several of the larger boss battles and other situations have button sequences that need to be pushed as they appear to perform context-sensitive moves that look cool as hell. Then there's those games of old-school \"Pitfall\", and \"Arkanoid\" you play in Murderworld...  Plenty to do in this game. You'll also earn several unlockable (and upgradeable!) alternate costumes for each hero and solo (or \"comic\") training missions for the playable heroes in the game if you can hunt down their discs.  These missions are a godsend and allow you to learn each individual hero's abilities outside of the chaotic team battles and engage in some memorable duels with classic villains (Elektra vs Bullseye: round 2?  You know you want it!).  I only wish that each character's missions were a little more customized; they all consist of one of the same four or five levels with different bosses at the end.Some of the cutscenes in the game look unbelievable (there is a Nightcrawler sequence that rivals the one in the 2nd X-Men film) while others are rather unpolished.  The voice acting is spotty at best, but several of the character's voices closely resemble their animated counterparts and it's fun to hear your heroes banter during battle (Deadpool, unsuprisingly, even has wisecracking as one of his special powers) and the graphics during gameplay are a massive improvement over \"X-Men Legends\", so there's really very little to complain about.Online multiplayer also looks to be a big draw this time out.  I haven't tried it out yet, but from what I've heard there is 4-player cooperative where everyone shares and shares alike, and competitive where your baddie-stomping statistics are tracked for bragging rights and to the winners go the spoils.  You can even play the comic missions with one player as the fearless hero and the rest of the players controlling the hordes of enemies.  The fun just keeps on coming.This is one of those games where, even after you've beaten it, you simply can't wait to start it over and play through it in a different way.  Personally, I'm relishing every action-packed second and whether you're an average gamer who loves to mash buttons and kick tail, a hardcore comic geek looking for an epic adventure featuring your favorite heroes, an RPG fan who enjoys lots of customization, or just a person looking for a game you pick up and play with your friends at home or online this is that game.  Buy it, own it, love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2006"}

It is so much like it I would not be surprised if there was a lawsuit at some point. Anyway, as the reviews here point out it is a very addictive game and you will spend hours building your civilization, exploring the world, interacting with other civilizations and maybe even learning some history. The thing I don't like about the game is that it is turn based. I know Sid has made games that weren't turn based, his Gettysburg game was a masterpiece of real time battle that I wish was either updated or made for the PS3. But back to this game, its tons of fun and easy to play, loaded with tutorials and help so you won't get lost. The Playstation Store has a free Demo, that's how I got hooked, check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2009"}

In some ways it's easier than the Guitar Hero / Rock Band games - in other ways it's more creative.First, the basics. You can play a song with 1-4 people. You can play a few minigames with 1-4 people. Also, you can take their built in lessons.I find the start-up of the game tedious. You have to go through a series of boring lessons when all you want to do is start playing. The game isn't complicated - wave the controls up and down to hit the drums, piano keys, or pretty much any instrument you play. I love the selection of instruments available, and that there are various stages to play on. The song selection is extremely limited though. You only have a few songs to start with and not that many more to unlock. Most are public domain songs, with a few Nintendo songs and a spare handful of \"real\" songs thrown in. With all the amazing music games out there, you'd think they could have FAR more songs in the set, whether they're old classics or new ones.In most other games like Guitar Hero you are trying to match the notes. The song has ABBB, you have to try to play ABBB in the right rhythm. Here, it's a free for all. You hammer the notes as much or as little as you want, and they play \"in key\". This makes it amazingly fun for kids - but more frustrating for musicians. You can't add your own take. All you can do is play or not play a note. Maybe you can play it louder or softer - but that's about it.Still, within the context of the game, this can be fun. You can layer tracks. So you can play a drum beat, and then add a piano track, and then add a trumpet track. You can create your own \"versions\" of songs, perfectly in tune, based on your instrument and rhythm choice. This can be fun - but again it's very limited. The song list is extremely short so all you're doing is playing with their minimal song set and creating new versions with their instruments.For the mini-games, there are three. Play along with songs with handbells, which IS a hit-the-right note game a la Guitar Hero. There is Wii Conductor which we found very frustrating, where the orchestra goes faster or slower based on your hand movements. The orchestra isn't very responsive. Finally there is a fun music quiz that helps you learn about pitch, chords and scales. We enjoyed the challenge in this one.Still, the game is not one we went back to after the initial playing. We have many other music games, some which let you create your actual own songs. This game only lets you mimic an extremely limited set of songs with the notes they make you play. I do appreciate the wide range of instruments available, but they really need a new version with MANY more songs and with more note-customization available before this becomes a true creative adventure.Finally, on the drums, there's just no way waving at air and trying to foot-tap on a balance board can come near the Ion drum kit experience for Rock Band 2. They are extreme worlds apart. Anyone who wants to have lots of fun drumming should definitely be looking into the Ion / RB2 combination.Still, great for young kids who want to bang away and always be guaranteed to be in tune! They won't \"fail\", they won't \"be booed away\" - they simply thrash the controllers and the music sounds lovely.Rating: 4/5 stars if bought for young kids","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYUSU","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"A good workout","reviewText":"If you're not familiar with the Rabbids series it is a collection of casual mini games well suited for both parties and families. If you liked the genre of games like Mario Party and Carnival Games, you'll probably like this one.Pros:Casual - Like most iPhone games, you can easily pick this up and just start playing for a little bit until you get tired of it. It's also really easy to figure out and understand without the instruction manual if you're already familiar with playing Kinect games.Fun for Groups - This is great for dinner parties and get togethers.Fitness - This game is a really good cardio workout. What's great about it, is that you don't even notice that you're working out until the game ends and the points are being tabulated. This game is really great if you want to start working out again.Variety - There's a decent mix of game types, from jogging in place, swimming with your arms, bobbing up and down, slapping things, and so on to keep this fresh for you and your guests. I think there are 20+ different mini games.Cute - I think this is a big reason as to why the series keeps doing well. The characters are cute and funny, and overall the game is wholesome.Controls - While it's not perfect (after all it's a Kinect game), controls overall are pretty responsive and generally accurate. This may vary depending on your living room setup (lighting, space, etc...) and if you activated Kinect ID.Cons:Living Room Space - This has more to do with the Kinect's limitations than it does with the game itself. Specifically, the number of players this game realistically supports depends upon how much living room space you have. In my living room the game easily supports 1 person and comfortably supports 2 players. However it's really tight with 3-4 players.Controls - If your living room setup (lighting, space, etc...) isn't ideal and if you haven't activated Kinect ID with everyone playing the game (Kinect ID is a way for the Kinect to save how you look in your living room from different positions and different angles with a particular lighting), you'll more than likely experience control issues.More People = More Fun - This isn't a game you play alone. It just isn't that fun without other people either watching or playing alongside with you.Repetitive - As with all Party genre games, eventually it will get more repetitive the more you play itMay or may not be appropriate for all ages - There is a virtual pet feature called My Rabbid. Right now I don't see the point of it aside from beating up a virtual Rabbid character. (I think you can dress him up and buy it 'gifts', with points you earn. Most of the gifts seem to hurt him though e.g. a falling cow) Depending on your tastes, this may or may not be suitable for your kids that are younger than 10. Then again the whole premise of the game seems to be beating up Rabbids so take this critique with a grain of salt.No Fitness Metrics - For a game that makes you sweat, it's a bit strange that they didn't include anything to track 'workouts'. I think this will probably be added to a future installment.Verdict:This is a good Kinect game to add to your library to play with other people. Just make sure that your living room is a good fit for Kinect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

Prepare to experience an RPG unlike any other. Welcome to the world ofShadow Hearts.","reviewerName":"A. Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"An rpg with a nice blend of wry humor, horror themes and innovative battle engine","reviewText":"I was fortunate enough to buy a copy of Shadow Hearts when it was first released in 2002 and I was glad that I did. If it wasn't for the release of Final Fantasy X that same holiday season, Shadow Hearts would easily have taken best RPG of 2004. Midway's Shadow Hearts is a nice blend of irreverent, wry humor wrapped around the usual apocalyptic storyline prevalent in most RPGS, but the new twist this time is the heavy dose of horror and occultic themes. The PS1 rpg series Persona tried this horror-theme rpg before, but Shadow Hearts succeeds where Persona almost does it.The storyline and especially the dialogue is funny, but there's always a sense of horror just beneath it all. The horror is best shown in the art direction of city and dungeon levels. Some of the scenes in Shadow Hearts practically oozes gore and splatter. The design of the creatures and bosses are pretty original and seem similar in form to the monster from the Silent Hill games. Bodies of animals and people are put together as if by random. Some monsters are nothing but a collection of legs put together. Now that doesn't sound scary, but the way its designed sure gives it an eerie and disturbing appearance. One stage pretty much details the after-effects and potential continuation of mass child-murders. With the leftover eaten remains and gnawed on bones littering the boss fight's lair. Shadow Hearts really isn't Final Fantasy.The Justice Ring is a nice change of pace to the usual turn-based battle system used in most Japanese rpgs. The battle system is still turn-based, but every action outside of defending is affected on how well the player hits his mark on the Justice Ring. This keeps the player from just picking an action and seeing what happens. The Justice Ring system keeps the player involved throughout the whole battle. Sometimes perfect use of the Justice Ring is a must to fight and succeed against certain bosses and situations.Shadow Hearts may not have the pedigree of the Final Fantasy series, but this first game is a good start for Midway to build their own successful rpg series. As long as they just continue to improve on the core successes that made the game so unique and fun then I see great things for this series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Paul","summary":"A classic","reviewText":"A true classic of the rpg genre.Great gameplay, immersive and rich storyline, fun multiplayer experience.

But not for everyone due to all the hate","reviewText":"The Good: Entertaining story and characters, great multiplayer suite, zombies mode is a blast, can play entire game on Wii U gamepad, a lot of fun weaponsThe Bad: Still a shooting gallery at it's core, real life likenesses of celebrities is disgusting, multiplayer hasn't evolved muchHere we go again, another Call of Duty. When will it ever end? Before you start the hate mongering, just know this, Call of Duty still has some of the best online multiplayer you can get. At least Black Ops tried to change the series a bit with new modes and experimented with what Modern Warfare established, it also had a much more interesting story line and had decent characters. Black Ops II is the same way, but it's too late to really matter.The game picks up from where the first left off, if you haven't played it, good luck figuring it out. Alex Mason is searching for a man named Raul Menendez. This is one sick puppy. This guy is a terrorist and more evil than you can imagine. The story jumps around from Mason's son, Alex, to David Mason back in the cold war. If you notice something, this game is more futuristic. It's set in 2025 so there is some cool tech that's just out of reach for today. Things like cloaking devices, VTOLs, and various other guns. The game just jumps between the first cold war and the second. During the first one you are trying to figure out what made Menendez crack, you later jump to the second one with Mason and Harper using the info you got from a guy who was in the cold war with Mason. It's a bit confusing, and seems pretty boring at first. Later on the story really picks up and gets really interesting, I actually liked it. It's not fantastic and it's no Assassin's Creed, but it's pretty good for an FPS.The campaign is still a shooting gallery, but it doesn't seem that way thanks to great level design, and a lot of cinematic one-off moments. Moments like jumping on turrets, driving various vehicles and aircraft, among others. It's all fun and not a single level feels the same, but the underlying core is still there: shoot everything that moves. The AI is still pretty dumb, but I like how you can customize your loadout before a mission. There are many unique and fun guns unlike the Modern Warfare series. Later on you will be able to play through special side missions called Strike Force Missions, that is pretty much just a capture-and-hold mode or siege. Those side missions all feel the same and are pretty repetitive. It's not as fun as online because of the dumb AI, you have to do everything yourself.After you finish the entertaining story it's multiplayer time! The old Black Ops modes return like One in the Chamber and Last Man Standing. Of course all the others from the entire series are here. Honestly, the biggest change is that killstreaks have been replaced with scorestreaks which I prefer. It was so hard to get more than 3-4 kills in a row for most players. Now you get streaks based on your score which lets you be able to use the cooler more powerful ones more often. However, I found the maps to be pretty mediocre. I learned to like a few, but they are lacking a bit in some way.Zombies returns and is as fun as ever, there are more modes, and 8 player co-op, it also has the full on online component unlike the previous game. There's quite a bit of content here and you will be coming back for hours to come. I just don't understand why Treyarch couldn't break from the mold a bit more. I like the multiple endings and how choices in the story can change the ending. But there are things here like Jimmy Kimmel's likeness in one ending, and Avenged Sevenfold at the end of one. I mean really? Are 14 year olds really going to buy this because Avenged Sevenfold is in it? I really hate how developers do this and can't just use their own ideas. It's a cop-out/sell-out whatever you want to call it. I also don't understand why the campaign can't be a bit more intelligent gameplay wise like Battlefield 3. I blame the young gamer's instant gratification issue on that, but who knows.What's here is a solid game, and hopefully the last of the Black Ops series. The Wii U version looks a bit better than consoles and you can play the whole game on the gamepad which is nice, no shoehorned gimmicks for it. I did notice that the gamepad's analog sticks are a bit sensitive and I had some trouble adjusting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

All games should be like this for the PS3! So many First Person Shooters on the PS3, and the system obviously will allow keyboard and mouse but the game developers won't do it. They know it is superior to the controller, because in online-multiplayer mode they have options that would ban keyboard and mouse users from playing with controller users.This is the only game I found to support keyboard and mouse and I looked all over. A lot of people say why not just use PC if your that in love with it, and the answer is \"because I'd have to buy a $2000 gaming PC\". No compatibility issues with the PS3. Good graphics no problems.Binding the keys is easy, highlight what you want to bind then hit ENTER and then hit the correct key to bind it. Done in the options/input area. It won't let you set a custom crouch key, and seems to be set always at \"C\", the only bad thing I could find. Maybe a patch will fix this or some other way around it.Some notes about the game itself: You can play deathmatch, capture the flag, and some other modes like that in single-player \"Instant Action\" against bots, like the original Unreal. Also it allows you to set the difficulty of the bots, and add modifiers to each match, such as slow-mo, low gravity, and insta-gib, which is one-shot one-kill with rifles.The campaign is pretty much just some talk and story surrounding the previous modes mentioned. Story &lt;Capture the Flag> Story &lt;Deathmatch> Story &lt;Capture the Flag with Nodes>. The only thing I can note that is unique, as far as I've seen, that is in this version of Unreal III, you can drive and fight in vehicles during some of the modes like Capture the Flag.For the keyboard & mouse support alone, this is a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2009"}

I will say that i enjoyed WWE2K14 far more than last year`s game, it plays a bit more fluid and faster, to me the controls work much better, the wrestler`s look (for the most part) a heck of a lot more realistic than WWE13. For WWE2K14, there are 100 create a wrestler slots, compared to 50 in past games. You get  a mode called &#34;30 Years Of WrestleMania&#34;, reliving 45 of the best matches from wrestleMania and boy does this bring back memories for me from my much younger days and they even created the actions authentically of each match all the actions of the wrestlers, it is quite a sight to behold, you get to see my favorite match &#34;Andre The Giant  vs Hulk Hogan&#34; fantastic, also another mode called &#34;The Streak&#34; where you try to defeat &#34;The Undertaker`s&#34; undefeated streak at WrestleMania, and trust me it won`t be easy, (he`s not called the &#34;Dead Man&#34; for nothing), but the streak can be broken, also there is &#34;The Defend The Streak mode&#34; where as The Undertaker, you defend your streak against multiple wrestlers for a winner or not, two great modes. The roster is very good, but there should have been more current wrestlers in the game, but a good roster just the same. there is DLC to add even more wrestlers to the game and now in &#34;Universe Mode&#34; there is something called &#34;Rivalry Manager&#34; where you can manage the rivalries in your universe, if you choose or let &#34;Universe' do it for you. You can still design your own Arena`s, Logo`s and of course your own wrestlers. There are new OMG! moments added to this years game. (you can look them up on &#34;YOUTUBE) Now for the bad (i have been playing this game now for 3 weeks give or take) i have had freeze up`s in 3 places, 1. in 'Supertar edit/create&#34;, just clicking on it froze up 3 times so far. 2. in &#34;Create an Entrance,&#34; i have had it freeze up i time, 3. at the end of a match, when the &#34;REPLAYS&#34; start and the game froze up 4 times. The glitches so far for me has been in a match wrestlers arms are bent backwards, but it fixed it self and in cage matches a wrestlers hair grows to the point it takes half the screen on the tv, it fixed it self, wrestlers floating up to the ring apron, but it fixed it self and &#34;Hulk Hogan&#34; having some super power to make other downed wrestlers levitate and float towards him and again it fixes it self. So far i have not seen anymore glitches. I was able to stop the freeze up after matches by turning off &#34;REPLAYS&#34; for all matches. The customization options (for create a wrestler) have not changed since SvR 2007 0r 2008. Now with all of that said, this is the very best wrestling game to come along in a while, trust me. None of the glitches or freeze ups happen all of the time, like WWE13 (they have been far apart and few)  I think to make the game the very best &#34;2k Sports&#34; needs to rid it self of the game developer &#34;YUKES&#34;, it is time for them to go, if WWE2K15 is in this shape i for one will not be buying anymore WWE games and i so love these games, but i can`t dish out $60.00, plus $20.00 more for DLC and the game is in this shape.

{"product_name":"B000A0EFJC","reviewerName":"OmnilimbO","summary":"Long live the Kong","reviewText":"The game is both a First Person Adventure and a Third Person Action. You play as a human in the first person adventure sequences, and as Kong himself in the third person sections. Both modes are merged together within the storyline, flowing from one to the other.  The story line determines which one you will be playing at any given time.While playing as the human, you will have to overcome various obstacles and solve puzzles throughout the game. Many of the puzzles include finding handles to turn in order to open doors, or finding fire to burn some bushes blocking your path. While playing as man, it gives you a deep feeling of the `survival' element because ammo is scarce and you will often have to pick up and throw sharp bones or spears at enemies, in order to conserve your resources.Graphically, this game is amazing. I was truly impressed with the level of detail all throughout this game. The hair on Kong is jaw-dropping and will keep you wondering how in the world the console can generate that amount of detail. The environments are lush and well designed.While playing as Kong, you will mainly have some platform jumping, which is really easy to do, and mainly fight off dinosaurs and the human savages of the island, destroying their villages as you pass through. Kong's adventure is shorter than man's.In both modes whenever you are badly injured, the screen turns read, all you have to do is stop or avoid taking damage and you health will recharge itself. There are no health packs in this game. Saving can be done at anywhere in the game however you will sometimes start at the beginning of the chapter of somewhere in the middle. The chapters for each mode aren't long to complete. Some of them are as short as ten minutes or as long as half an hour. Luckily whenever you die, you start not to far from where you were killed off..Although Kong may lack the depth of game play desired by more advanced gamers, it is a truly unique gaming experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

And Nintendo is the master of creating games that are pleasant to look at and to play.  The Mario series is just addictive, as are many other Nitendo franchises.  Third-party support is a bit thin compared to the PS2 and the Xbox, but you do get top-notch games like Resident Evil (admittedly a bit &quot;old&quot; at this point).  And the Cube is so cute!  I think it's unfair to dismiss this as a console for kids only.  It has a supercomputer-like CPU and games like Metroid Prime look better than anything on the Xbox or PS2.  Plus this is the most affordable console of the three platforms.  I got one last year and haven't touched the other two since.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2004"}

But, all good (and bad) things come to an end eventually and the initial SixAxis finally expired so we had no choice but to go for the DS3.To make the long story short: we are happy with it. It's the old SixAxis plus the vibrations. At this time, we get the DS3 to vibrate with most of the games we play. I'm playing Fallout 3 these days and it vibrates quite nicely when weapons are fired or when mines explode and the kids are busy with Little Big Planet and the DS3 is compatible with LBP too.For anyone who's not familiar with the PS3 controllers, their main features are:- rechargeable- Bluetooth enabled- motion sensitive- support rumble and vibrationsThat's just about it.

The service provides users with discounts, free games, online storage and much more that I will outline below.  The offered digital Playstation Plus subscription code is a safe alternative for users who do not Own, or wish to give their credit card to Sony, or use Playstation Network Cash cards.COSTThere are currently two models of subscription;  3mo @ $17.99 or ~$6.00/mo  and 12mo @ $49.99 or ~4.17/mo.  Obviously the best deal is the 12mo offer.  **This card gives you a 3mo subscription**ADVANTAGES- Every month the Playstation Store will have featured products available for Playstation Plus users.  This often amounts to at least one free \"featured\" game offered per month, as well as various other free titles.- Playstation plus holders will also receive special discounts on select items, which changes every month.  The price reduction can be anywhere from 10% to 75% off an item or package deal.- Exclusive features!  Automatic Download service to keep all your games up-to-date without physically having to launch the title.  150MB of online data storage for your save game files or data files (You can even back up copy-restricted saves)- FULL GAME TRIALS.  That is right folks.  On the boarder about that new title that just came out. Playstation Plus members get a \"full game trial\".  It acts as if you physically bought the game and allows you 1 full hour of game play before disabling itself.- Early access!  As a Plus member you will receive early access to game demos and be given priority when it comes to specific Beta invite handouts, Plus members are first to get access.- Free Plus themes and avatars.  Not exactly amazing but who doesn't love free stuff!DISADVANTAGES- As a playstation plus member you have access and perks from all the above. HOWEVER if you do not renew your subscription things can get a little complicated.*** Any Playstation PLUS item you received that was *FREE* such as a featured game, or maybe an avatar/theme will become \"disabled\" upon expiration of your PLUS subscription.*** Any Item you had to physically pay for, even if it had a special PLUS discount of 99% will not be disabled upon expiration of your subscriptionSo what it amounts to, anything FREE you get from PLUS is really more of a long term rental as long as you are PS+, while items you pay for even with a discount will always be yours.OVERALLThe playstation plus plan is not for everyone.  However it is a plan that rewards its subscribers with plenty of perks and loads of content each month.  If you think about it, at $4-$6/mo  and a free $10-$15 game each month in theory the subscription pays for itself each month, not even factoring in all the other perks like the free full game demos.  While the $17.99 card is not the best deal, it makes a great card to experience Playstation PLUS for 3 months without laying out too much money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2011"}

W. Mullins","summary":"Beautiful, and frustrating","reviewText":"There is no way for Killzone 2 to live up to all the hype surrounding it. This game has been the 'coming thing' for PS3 for almost four years. Will Killzone 2 meet and exceed all of the expectations? No. Is Killzone 2 the definitive first person shooter for the PS3 to date? Definitely.The graphics are amazing, you can sit back and watch the cut scenes, gameplay and environment on an good HDTV and just be amazed. The level of detail in the environment and characters is simply stunning. And there is a realness to the world, you feel as if every bullet fired is real and has weight to it. The use of lighting is amazing and exceptionally accurate, from muzzle flashes and explosions, to the shadow cast by your character when he back lit from a light source it spot on.And the gameplay does not disappoint, more than most games you feel very realistically grounded in this game. You don't bound and leap effortlessly like Halo, nor move like a lumbering freight train like Gears of War, but somewhere in the middle. Your movement seems much more realistic to current real world applications, you feel as if you are carrying ammo and wearing body armor. Its really quite amazing how they have captured the feeling of real world weight.Now don't get me wrong, this is a sci-fi game and isn't supposed to be Rainbow Six, and it is not. But the developers have done well in finding a balance between futuristic and current which is nice. Killzone 2, like the first one, is quite hard though. Most plays will be able to get through on the easy or normal setting and really feel they did something. Anyone who can beat it on a higher setting is exceptional though. You will die often and no always know why. I also found shooting to take some getting used to. The effortless aiming players are used to from RSV or Halo is not to be found in Killzone 2. I am not saying its worse, its just different. After a few hours of getting used to it I was able to get through just fine, but shooting still wasn't as easy for me as RSV.The campaign is fun, but the story is weak and cliche. The story is paper thin and seems to be just to give an excuse to move your character from one stage to the next. That being said most people won't pick Killzone 2 up for the campaign, but the multiplayer. And they won't be disappointed. Multiplayer has a variety of modes and a good number of maps. Maps seem to be set up with a couple chock points in mind so the majority of fighting will be done there, but it doesn't feel repetitive yet. There are a variety of classes and progression is rewarding. The only thing I found lacking were the spawn points on maps would often be quite a distance from the action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"MDias","summary":"Good game for its time","reviewText":"I just brought a Xbox to relive those memories of this ,halo,doom3 brought them all a month ago on amazon for 5 bucks a piece can't beat it ..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2012"}

This wouldn't be so bad but you can never tell when a boss will spring up, you just fought your way to a city, talk to a couple people, bam - overpowered boss fight - youre dead and you lose everything since your last save, and since there is no autosave feature that can mean you lose hours of leveling. Another huge annoyance was a stealth portion, which didn't fit and was tedious and annoying, this portion led to a boss, and bam you get the thrill of slowly making it back to where you were.The boss battles often last FOR FREAKING EVER!

So instead of buying a new 360 I just ordered a copy of the CoD4 Game of the Year instead. I notice no real difference between the PS3 version and teh 360 version.The story and gameplay is fantastic and hold up well against Modern Warfare 2. Granted the couple years of development helped to polish MW2 a bit better, but CoD4 stands up an a premier game still, three years later.The game play is fast and intense with constant streams of enemies attaching. That can be fun and at times can be annoying. Sometimes you just end up fighting until you cross a certain spawn point which means you really can't thin out the mass of enemies. You are better to movie forward that being tactical and slow. That means CoD4 can lend itself to a sort of run and gun gameplay style, particularly on the easier settings. On Hardcore and Veteran things get amazingly hard though and if you are looking for an amazing challege that is where you will find it. While I manage to eventually make it through the game on veteran towards the end it was an act of determination, since it was not fun anymore.The enemy AI is good and they will flank and take cover, though some will charge you at times resulting in a rifle butt to the face and instant death if you aren't fast enough. The weapons in game are great and all feel pretty unique. The reloading sequences are very accurate and the guns feel unique and weighty. In too many games the weapons all feel the same but in CoD4 there are advantages to each, even more so during multiplayer.The campaign is fantastic. Granted it follows the CoD pattern with epic set piece scenes and a very linear path. But the graphics and polish combined with the amazing story make it easy to immerse yourself in the game play. CoD has a habit of pushing the envelope with each now game and CoD4 is no different, from first person executions and nuclear explosions CoD4 has it all. I would also be remiss were I not to mention the level you operate as a gunner on an AC130. This level was so well done and such an amazing change of pace. You leave the gritty on the ground feel and get to fight through a level from the safety of a gunship. The in ship dialog is spot on and its hard to tell if you are watching actual footage online or playing the level, which is fantastic.All in all if you haven't jumped one to the CoD Modern Warfare bandwagon its time to get a ticket. Modern Ware 2 is a fantastic game by if you haven't played the first one yet you owe it to yourself to give it a play through.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

I think that the gameplay of each chapter is the same as the first chapter, and are quite long. It's nice to have the ability to transform into a tank or plane, but the weapons chosen for the game are far too common in shooters: rocket launcher, shotguns, plasma launchers, sniper rifles, assault rifles, so I feel that this is just like any other shooter in the market.In this game you first play as the decepticons, the story develops, and then you start playing with the autobots till the end of the game. Its half and half. In every moment they give you an objective and you should drive to it following the objective marker in your screen, as you search for it enemies are spawn and you have to fight them with your team (bots that are with you all the time). The thing is that every chapter is the same, so after playing the first chapter I feel I've played them all.I recommend to download the demo if it's still available at the PlayStation Store (as of sep 2012 it is),and if not at least search several videos in youtube. Try searching with the words \"gameplay\" in your search terms as this shows what you're going to be doing if you buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2012"}

It's not serious, but definitely noticeable.There is a lack of melee attacks other than the stealth and special kill attacks. What I mean to say is that there are no disarming or regular melee punches. You will need energy to do melee attacks.ProsGraphics are great some of the best in a FPS Game, the level designs show a very futuristic dark Detroit motor city.The cover system works very well and a lot better than most first person shooters.Augmentations make this possible as you customize your character to your liking to complete missions the way you want to.The storyline is great.Final thoughtsIn conclusion, Deus Ex:  Human Revolution is an excellent game.

The second thing I noted, as I lifted it out, was that it is very heavy.  This is no cheap plastic toy!  This is a solid, well-constructed, replica guitar.  And the quality shows.Inside the box, the guitar is well protected for shipping with bubble wrap and cardboard spacers.  Of note is the fact that this is a one piece unit.  This completely eliminates the connectivity issues between the neck and body, as sometimes seen in guitar controllers that come boxed as two pieces.  The guitar measures 33.75 inches from tip to base, with a slightly larger body than my Guitar Hero World Tour guitar, which measures only 31.25 inches in length (see the photo I posted with this review).  This extra length pushes the fret buttons up a little bit, but I did not find this to be an issue.  I store my guitars on a stand, but if you use a guitar bag or case, be aware that it might not fit.  Rounding out the included accessories are a user manual, a quality strap, some batteries to get you up and playing fast, and an adapter for older style Xbox 360 headsets.IMPRESSIONSThe guitar itself is modeled after Guitar Hero guitars, with the raised fret buttons and the neck slider feature.  Keep this in mind if you are someone who prefers the look of the Rock Band guitars, with their in-line fret buttons.  The chrome detailing, including tuning pegs and bridge, and use of real screws in the white pick guard lends an authentic look, effectively disguising the Start (bridge) and Star Power buttons (pickups) while keeping them functional.  There is even an authentic looking nut between the headstock and the neck. The Star Power button sits right under the ball of your hand, so it's easy to press down on while strumming (you can also still rock Star Power with a neck tilt).  The strum bar is the best I have ever seen on a guitar controller.  It has exactly the right tactile feel, and is responsive yet quiet.  One of my fret buttons makes a bit of a clickety-clack when I hit it, but I am hoping this goes away as it wears in.  Overall, this is a quiet guitar, allowing for more enjoyment of the music.COMPATIBILITYI have tested this guitar with the following Xbox 360 games that I own:* Band Hero: Yes* Guitar Hero Van Halen: Yes* Guitar Hero 5: Yes* Guitar Hero World Tour: Yes* Guitar Hero III: Yes* Guitar Hero II: Yes* Rock Band The Beatles: Yes* Rock Band 2: Yes* Rock Band: YesCONCLUSIONThis is a quality guitar controller that I would recommend to any serious gamer who wants to add authenticity to their music games.  It is a joy to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

Yeah, well I don't think that can happen from a game that's got a big ol' T in the lower left corner.Bully is a cult classic of a game, to say the least. This game put in any/everything you could think of from a classy prep. school and exaggerates them by 10 fold. Bully's 'protaganist'(and I say that losly) Jimmy Hopkins gets dropped of in a, what looks like a great school, disfunctional school full of drunk teachers, sterotypical clicks, and one person(you) can save the school, become the king, and hopefully beat the game.The good parts of the game are, well, the story(rockstar's known for that meaty story). It's full of wimsy cracks, we wished we could do when you get an F, and how to put down that egotistical bully in front of the school. The gameplays so-so, the fighting system could have been twerked a little, cause of the depth and lock-on system. The students at Bullsworth are so over the top. Rockstar exaggerated each group of students at an average school by so much,that the story is a great side-splitter! All the students have names and diffrent presonalities(com'on, who could forget Russel or Pee Stain). And finally, the classes are hella sick. They utalize boring high school chemistry, and some others, and changes it into fun little mini games, in which if you win, you can earn vital skills.The bad parts are how short it is, the total thing would take bout 2 or 3 weeks to finish, but not including the extra tasks, and hidden things. The town of Bullsworth is not nearly as big as I would have expected it to be, and, Rockstar put in GAY bullies. Seriously. I know.Parents, overal, this is a game that is fun. Your child will not go and bring a riffle to school, or try to become a pimp or whatever your fears are, they most likly won't happen.

He plays them all; on pc and game systems, and even he thought this was by far one of the worst games he had ever played in the genre.  His opinion, and I quote, \"Why do these game developers keep trying to fix what ain't broken and come out with newer games and systems when the older ones are better than the new ones?\"  My thoughts exactly.  Now, this isn't my genre of game, but it IS his, which is why I grabbed it up as a freebie to review with him in mind.  He is really the only person I know who hunts in real life and LOVES these games, which he can play the rest of the year when hunting season is off.That said, of course I also played it and gave it my all to review it as well.  We both enjoyed the graphics and such that came with it being a newer game on a newer game system, thats really where it ended for us both.  I did enjoy hunting game of dinosaur, but I didn't play it long enough before losing interested to get to unlock it, I waited for him to, lol.  While that part was cool for, say, a minute, it was just as boring to me as the rest of the game.  And my stepdad?  \"Where are you gonna really hunt dinosaurs? They're extinct!\" So it took away the \"realism\" from his idea of what a hunting game SHOULD be.So, from someone who doesn't like this type of game to begin with, but has played the genre before (due to stepdad) to compare it to others, big thumb down!  I do not recommend this game at all.  And this kids also did not enjoy it, ages 13 and 6.And from my stepdad, late 40's, who hunts annually and plays games like this all the time since the NES first came out, another two big thumbs down!

{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"ALMOST PERFECT","reviewText":"To many, Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever made. I'd say it's as good as Final Fantasy 6 or 7, but not better. Although I rate it 5 stars, 4.5 stars is closer to it. It all has to do with the final ending boss--Lavos--and his three forms. In my opinion, Lavos is right up there with Kefka and Sephiroth, but Lavos isn't human, so that makes him the best non-human antagonist ever seen in a game. Lavos first appears as a porcupine-like creature. His eerie scream is as good as Kefka's laugh, too. After defeating the Lavos shell, you go inside and fight the machine part of Lavos. Looks okay, but not great. You beat that, then fight the last version of Lavos--the vegetable-looking version. He doesn't look evil, nor does he look good. So it's awful hard to hate him. The background effect is okay, but sorta annoying, and the music at that point is bland. But that's the only problem that I have with the game--the final ending boss. Everything preceding that is top-notch Squaresoft. The storyline is really great on this game. My favorite parts are: Chrono's Trial (as good as the opera scene in FF6), the Future (especially the bike race against that Prince-like guy), the Battle against Magus in his castle is especially awesome because the music fits in so PERFECTLY with the battle. The little movie scene showing Lavos falling to earth is also a joy to see. There are ten endings to this game and many sidequests. Tough luck finding a good copy of it now, but you can get it on emulator, which is almost as good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2001"}

Needless to say, the fact you get a 2-in-1 deal here of two of the best, if not THE best PS2 exclusives is enough to warrant purchase right now.  But it is the games themselves (and the quality titles they are), and the fact they've been ported to the PS3 for persons like myself who don't own a backwards compatabile system, that make this purchase worth it.  Of course, my suggestion (due to personal experience) is this: Don't play the series backwards, largely due to the fact that when you reach the original game you may be disappointed in gameplay (ie. L1 & R1 buttons are L2 & R2 in the first game - annoying for those accustomed to the more recent controls).  Graphics for GOW1 are, of course, dated in comparison to God of War 2, and especially to God of War 3.  But the value of the God of War Collection far outshines any issues one may have with, say, graphics or the switching of controls.  I personally think God of War 2 is the best in terms of music and storyline (including the recent God of War 3), but that's just me.

I just got this last week because I have so many other games to play and I had not finished AC2. I have been playing this several hours per day and can see some amazingly good additions to the game. I will be speaking to the improvements I see as there are already some fine reviews giving a whole overview. If you have not played AC1 and AC2 then this might not be as helpful to you. If so, read on.Combat: OverviewRight off the combat system is greatly improved. In the past the taunt was about useless. Now it really does bother the foe enough to get a grab at their weapon or throw them off guard. The kick is easy to pull off and it gets them to drop their guard a bit. How many times have you fought an enemy in AC2 and would just pound and pound on their sword and hope one hit would get passed their defenses. In AC:B there are countless ways to get passed that wall and get a good shot in.Combat: StreaksI love the new streaks. As long as you can be quick enough you sometimes pull off multiple kills effortlessly. There is even achievements for kill streaks in the virtual training room.Horses:Now you can ride and fight from a horse. They also allow horses into the city. That always bugged me in AC1&2 the fact you had to dismount at the gate.Jumping and Climbing:It seems the climbing has been improved. It is still sometimes more difficult to climb areas that really are climbable but you didn't line up right. Jumping from ledge to ledge has been tweaked. It is now easier to make serial jumps.Outfits:I like the new armor. I wont go into a full spoiler but basically you start out with nothing again in the beginning.Online:Very fun to play online against other players. I am not very good 1v1 on these games so I did not enjoy it as much as others would, not the games fault, I just got roflstomped too often.Overall:This game is a perfect addition to the series. It takes what was good and improves it. If you have played the first 2 then you owe it to yourself to continue the journey.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

WHAT THE HELL IS RAIDEN DOING HERE.  Alot of people had a problem with Raiden being in it.  I'm not...I mean it's Metal Gear Solid For crying out loud!  Metal Gear Ray is awesome.  Not as good as Rex though....The plot was a little confusing at times and I was annoyed by the Kodec...ON AND ON...JEEZ when does Raidens Girlfriend NOT call.Lets start shall weGraphics....5/5The graphics are great.  Very welldone.  The Enivermont desighn is fantastic.  Great job...Gameplay....4/5TO MANY CUT SCENES!!!  MGS 1 HAD MORE GAMEPLAY THEN THIS!And this game is wayyyy to short...Takes about 5 hours to beat..It took me about 4 hours and 34 minutes..But I skipped most of the cutsences....And I hated the way the ending was...I would have liked it more if it was Snake Vs Ocelot in a metal Gear ray boss battle...More better from my opinion then Raiden Vs Abunch of Metal Gear Rays.Sound...5/5Superb..Music is great..Overall Mgs2 doesn't quiet Match up to the Original MGS which Alot of people think is the Greatest Adventure game ever made...I think so to.If the question...Is MGS worth buying the answer is..YES.This game is still a classic and one of PS2's Stronger points.Not as good as PSX's original Metal Gear solid but one step below.  But MGS3 will be the best MGS ever!So go out and buy this game if you really like MGS and don't be turned off by the game just Cause Raiden takes the place of the Legendary Snake who happens to be in the game for about 45 to 50 minutes...Still it's a great game...Haven't played Substance and don't on planning it either...Overall it's a great gameLater....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2004"}

They have done so consistently; to my knowledge they have not made a true flop. While this expansion pack may not be the most groundbreaking of their work, it is of superb quality.

The graphics are pleasant. The voice acting is not great, and the story is a bit lacking, but when it comes down to the core of the gameplay the game succeeds by any measure.In fact, the game plays so well in terms of strategy and pure fun that nothing but a five star rating makes sense.

A lot of people say that E.T. was the main reason the market fell out, but that only scratches the surface. The real problem is that consumers were bamboozled into purchasing shoddy products under strong banner titles. Games were often poorly conceived, and even more often, poorly executed.It's a strange way to begin a review, but it's appropriate for this latest piece of hurried trash, \"Fallout: New Vegas\". The concept here is solid, but the execution is abysmal. It's not the first time we've seen a game with poor quality control (\"Dragon Age\" immediately jumps to mind), and in fact, it's not the first time we've seen a Fallout game with poor QC (\"Fallout 3\" was riddled with freezes, marring an otherwise-excellent outing).So, why do I hammer this game for these flaws? Well, \"Fallout: New Vegas\" is, for the most part, IDENTICAL to \"Fallout 3\". The mechanics are the same. The interaction is the same. Heck, many of the environments were completely recycled from \"Fallout 3\". How is it then that this game not only matches its predecessor in bugs, design flaws and whatnot, but in fact, trumps it mightily? It boggles the mind that a publisher would actually put their stamp of approval on this, but then again, American (and more generally, Western) game designers have long allowed shoddy products off their lines. After all, if you can patch it, what's the big deal? &lt;cue sarcastic eyeroll>Anyway, let me begin with:The Good:1) The Universe. The fallout universe remains entertaining enough for this endeavor. While this game feels like little more than a very long expansion of \"Fallout 3,\" that's not a bad thing inherently. The Mojave desert makes for a nice post-apocalyptic setting, and the El Dorado of New Vegas is a satisfying destination. Moreover, the character development system remains as fun as ever. There is one problem with this, I will detail below: it is completely unbalanced. But the idea is sound, even the execution is horrible.2) Hardcore mode. What a splendid idea. You mean I can't stay up for hundreds of hours at a time without eating food or drinking water? It's nice to see this implemented in the game. It makes for a completely different experience, and is well worth the effort.3) Factional Reputation. This is what \"Fallout 3\" should have been about. Morality is a tricky thing in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. Relativism is the obvious answer. Here we are introduced (or perhaps re-introduced, although I haven't played Fallout or Fallout 2) to reputation. Rather than having a single overarching trait determine your standing with people, you can develop different feels with different groups. A great idea. My only problem with it is this: while there are many titles you can get, they all pretty much do the same thing. I saw now discernible difference between being \"vilified\" and being a \"merciful thug\". Both of these resulted in my being shot on sight. Also (for some stupid reason), karma remains, which somewhat poisons the experience, but I'll mention that below.The Bad:1) Glitches. Bugs. Whatever you want to call them, they're here, and they are pathetic. Firstly, the game freezes often. During my first playthrough, I encountered over 20 freezes (in a 30-hour endeavor). That's unacceptable. But it goes deeper than that, even. Many quests are completely bugged, and cannot be finished under certain circumstances. I was pleased to complete a particular Brotherhood of Steel quest...until I found out that it actually would never be completed, because of some decisions I had made. While trying to combat a computer virus, my high Science ability...ensured that I could never complete the task, because of yet another bug. I tried to help a rape victim overcome her psychological trauma...or I would have, if yet another bug caused her never to speak to me. And the beat goes on. And on. And on.The fact is, this is pathetic. I don't spend top dollar to hear some stupid computer nerd make excuses as to why I shouldn't expect a complete product. Fix the $&%! game, or don't release it. It's even more angering to hear critics praise this game, despite the numerous bugs in the final product. I can deal with reading some fan say, \"I can deal with this! 5 stars!\" But a supposedly impartial critic (IGN, I'm looking in your direction)? Unacceptable.2) Game balance. Assuming you can deal with the myriad bugs in the product, you will find that the game is highly unbalanced. Back when I first read about this game in Game Informer, I was told of how little-used perks would be incredibly useful this time around. I heard that some skills would be so much more useful. It's a total lie.The worst offender is in fact the skill. While weapon skills are OK (although the balance still tends towards guns being the best, and explosives being the worst, IMHO), the other skills are either overpowering, or laughable. Speech? Incredible skill. You can pretty much do whatever you want, whenever you want, with high speech. In fact, there are many things you simply CAN'T do without it. Science? Fantastic skill. With the exception of the bug I mentioned above, science gets you out of a lot of scrapes, AND you can hack computers. There aren't as many this time around (or at least I didn't find them), but they do great things.On the other hand, a skill like Barter? Pathetic. Sure, I can get more money, but why would I care? You'll be overflowing in caps most of the time (particularly if you use guns - you will never have to buy or pay for repairs or ammo). There are a scant few speech challenges, and even then, most of them can be done with high speech. Another loser is medicine. Sure you can get more oomph from stimpaks, but you'll find so many on your mission, it's totally pointless. I can remember two times where medicine came up in a non-trivial way in challenges. One was for a side mission which was not listed in my journal (and thus completely unimportant). The other came up in one of the main quests, and it turns out that even if I didn't have it, I would have been fine.In short, regardless of your build, some skills NEVER show any worth, while others are INCREDIBLE. Poor planning for a game that was supposed to restore some balance to this system.3) Karma. What's the point? As far as I can tell, karma did NOTHING in the game, other than give one additional screenshot during one of the endings. Your karma is completely irrelevant to factional repuation as far as I can tell. Why even put it in? Do I really have to hear how bad I am when I am helping Caesar's Legion against the NCR? Anyway, there are no trophies associated to it, so feel free to do what you want.So, there you have it. I would recommend this only for the biggest of fans, and even then, you're likely to be disappointed. \"New Vegas\" really brings nothing new to the table, and the shoddy execution manages to mar everything.As the Legion would say, caveat emptor.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

Rarely do I become frustrated with a game. In all the history of me playing console games I have never had a game freeze on me. While it's only frozen once so far in my play through, so many other problems with it make me want to pull my hair out.For one, the gameplay on the ps3 is terrible. While the VATS system is nice, actual combat is terrible. Using the thumb sticks to aim, you can almost never hit your target the first time, almost guaranteeing that you will get hit. When Rad Scorpions now give you poision damage that gradually suck your health away, it has become an effort in luck, which is not how any game should be. You can't block, or \"melee\" knocking a target back (like in borderlands), so there is no way to stop or prevent a hit. While you can argue that very few shooters give you that option, in an RPG like this, some sort of defense mechanism is needed. I literally wanted to throw my controller through the screen in frustration fighting enemies, and that hasn't happened to me since the playstation 1 days.Speakingh of combats, weapons aren't very original, you'll run out of bullets for weapons rather quickly, and not all merchants have the same bullet types to buy. Instead of combating being fun, it can be a serious chore to try and aim and bob and weave bullets since you're character is soooo slooow. You'd think they would have adjusted your run speed since you can spend 30 minutes traveling from one place to another, and since your character moves at a crawl, it can get seriously tedious. I just can't stress how frustrating combat can be, and how dissapointing it is.The graphics for whatever reason are hideous. I played fallout 3 for the pc, and while they weren't a technical achievement they were nice. The desert is bland and textures repeat. It's sparesly populated and when you do have an encounter, enemies run faster than you so you are again, guareteed to take damage instead of relying on skill to play.Overall this is pretty much Fallout 3.5. I haven't noticed any serious differences between this and Fallout 3, but they are asking a full game price. [...] bucks in store for this is a serious rip off. Especially give the horrendous loading times which seriously damper an exploration based game. Waiting 10 to 20 seconds to enter a room, finding nothing of interest, then leaving causing another 20 second load time is mind numbing. When traveling youll find the game stutters from loading the next area, which isn't a game killer but is distracting.Music is sparse. It be nice for a few different medoldies while you traverse the wasteland, but you get one tune and while nice, gets old after awhile. You can load the radio, but since it's all music from the 60's, it isn't especially enticing,I know I've ragged on it a lot, but I literally just threw my controller from the combat frustation, but there are some nice elements here. VATS is fun and there are a lot of weapons. You have lots of choices to make which is what gives fallout it's advantage on other games.It's really just pathetic they released it in this state, with these difficulty tweaks and basically the same gameplay as fallout 3. They seriopusly need to revamp combat and the graphics for the next one. Defintely wait till this hits [...] bucks or a GOTY edition is released. As it stands now it IS NOT worth the 60 asking price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"Absolutely mind blowing as a multiplayer game, not as fun single player.","reviewText":"This game is a little tough for me to rate because on one hand you have the single player mode which is average at best and on the other hand you have the amazing multi-player mode which just might be the most fun I've had on my Live account (when everything is just right). In the end, this game deserves the 5 stars because it doesn't really try to be a compelling single player game, it's quite obvious this game is meant to be played with a few friends.I'm going to do this review a little differently. Instead of talking about every aspect of this game and what makes it so great, what I'll do is give you one of the endless possible scenarios and if this sounds fun then this is the game for you. First let me say the graphics are good (the aging Source engine never fails to impress me), sound is good - blah blah blah, lets get to the fun:It's you and three of your best friends trying to survive through one of the campaigns (it's always teams of four, either human, AI or a mix of both). You come to a situation where you need to activate a lift to progress through the campaign. It's time to strategize because the game tells you that you're about to face a large battle against the infected. After talking it through you decide it might work best if two of you go up on the awning and provide cover for the other two that will stay on the ground. This game plays differently every time so even though you know it's going to be a large battle, you don't know exactly whats going to be thrown at you . Even though you guys have been here many times before it's not going to be exactly the same as the other times.Well, you throw a couple gas containers in the middle for good measure (who doesn't like their zombies well-done?). Everyone signals they're ready - it's time to hit that switch. As soon as you do that about 40 zombies come rushing over the fence running after you at super-human speed. Your friend Scott (on the awning with you) shoots the gas container lighting them all on fire. Now they're burning but they're still running after your two friends on the ground (We'll call them Trish and Mike). Mike throws a pipe bomb (which attracts them) so all the burning zombies chase the pipe bomb, they blow up. Now there are zombies coming from every direction, some are coming through the windows, some are jumping over the fence - they're everywhere. A zombie jumps on Trish and pins her down (Hunter). The hunter starts tearing her to shreds so you get one lucky shot off and blow that zombie off of her. Meanwhile you hear Mike screaming for help - he is entangled in another zombies long disgusting tongue and cannot move (Smoker). You jump off the awning to get a better shot at the smoker so you can free your friend but a large disgusting zombie vomits all over you making it almost impossible to see for a short period of time (Boomer). This vomit attracts zombies so now you're being rushed and you can't see. You yell to your friends \"Help me! Help!!!!\" Mike is still entangled yelling for help but you can't do anything right now but blindly shoot and try to push away all the zombies that are pummeling you. Finally your vision clears and you are able to save Mike. Scott notices your low on health and he's nice enough to give you his health pack (you can only carry one at a time). What a relief! You heal yourself up and pump the remaining zombies full of shotgun rounds. Just when you think it's over a Smoker entangles you with his tongue and drags you about 50 feet across the concrete. You are helpless so you cry for help. Trish is nice enough to blow that zombies head clean off. During this whole ordeal you laugh, cry for help and maybe say an expletive or two (and you hear your friends doing the same).That was just one of the many possible scenarios and I only touched on what's possible with this game. Left 4 Dead offers a unique experience each play-through. Health items and weapons are located in different areas (health is sparse in this game), zombies come from different areas each time. Maybe one time you walk through a hallway and only have to fend off a few zombies but maybe the next time you play that campaign in the same exact hallway your screen starts shaking, the music starts going and you see a HUGE 10 foot insanely muscular beast of a zombie (Tank) come rushing after all four of you with a vengeance (The Tank tends to be the most feared, he's huge, powerful and hard to take down). You just never know what's going to happen.When you either have 3 good friends or get lucky and find a good group on Live then this game really shines, especially if everyone communicates and just has a good time. There is a single player mode but it's not nearly as fun - you need that group of people to really get the most out of Left 4 Dead. You need the real time strategy with your friends, the frantic cries and laughter, the \"WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU!!\". You just don't get that in the single player mode and Left 4 Dead doesn't try to be a compelling single player game. This is all about having a great time with your friends - the single player mode is just practice if anything.There are two multi-player modes. You can play one of four lengthy campaigns with a group of three others and yourself (takes between 30 mins and an hour depending) or you can play versus mode where it's zombies versus humans. Being a zombie is just as fun as being a human! Now you can scale walls, jump great distances...etc. You may feel a little concerned because there's only 4 campaigns but rest assured the dynamic nature of this game keeps it from becoming stale. Each campaign takes you through a good variety of different environments.There are many more details I could get into such as the movie-like nature of this game but I'll save you the extremely lengthy review and just try to capture the essence of Left 4 Dead.This game never gets boring. I've been playing games for over 20 years and sometimes I wonder if games have just lost their magic. Sure they are still fun but it's just not the same. Like a lot of us 'old-timers' say - \"they just don't make them like they used to\". Well, not true. When you have a group of fun friends then this game brings back that magic. this game is a slam dunk - wrapped in a hole in one - wrapped in bacon. If anyone tells you otherwise they just haven't played it like it's meant to be played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000K2X5","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"I'm in complete shock","reviewText":"You know, sitting behind a computer screen, I'm glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute I began playing Tekken 3. I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games, but also tagged \"the ultimate tournament fighter\" that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming.Tekken 3 really surprised me. But don't take that as a compliment. I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever. I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears. Back then I figured \"okay, either I don't like fighting games or maybe I just don't like the Mortal Kombat series\". This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis.A lot can change with a human being in 10 years. We grow older, we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from, and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives. To put it simply, we're thankful to be alive and feel good. But in some situations, things can remain EXACTLY the same. All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3. It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series.I really have no idea what went wrong. No, not with the game, I mean, what went wrong with ME. Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies, I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me. Appeal to me a LOT. That was my assumption. But apparently it STILL hasn't happened. Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as \"tournament fighters\". Nope. It's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I've played, and basically the same thing but with improved graphics, for that matter. All fighting games feel the same to me. It doesn't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters.Tekken 3, despite all the positive reviews, does NOT appeal to me whatsoever. The fighting is really clunky, and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other. It's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me. It's boring to watch, and even more boring to play. Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it's time to do the same thing in a video game? I have no idea. If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3, you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons. Strong emphasis on the word \"simple\". Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button, and then jump over to the Square button. How is someone supposed to easily master this? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.You see, for each of the ten characters in the game, they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent. However, many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off, and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently doesn't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone, of all ages. That way, young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style.It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game. They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game. Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly. We're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents. We're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match. Not just combos either- regular moves too. We're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly, and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are.Well, I have news for every developer out there: many of us have a really difficult time with games like this. Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player. Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills. Some of us are, you know, average \"normal\" gamers who just like to have fun. The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this, and years later, they still can't understand what it's like to have fun. We shouldn't have to be a genius to play a fighting game. Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights. Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them. Maybe one day...Other things I don't like about Tekken 3. Despite having excellent graphics, the music is a bunch of horrible, repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game. Oh, and by the way, even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest, there's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them. Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of, oh I don't know, Killer Instinct (another terrible game) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks. In fact, I'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct. Extremely uninteresting. When someone throws a punch, it's so boring to watch that you just don't care about it. That's what Tekken 3 is all about. Having a fighting engine that's so boring you don't even care if you win or lose.I'm disappointed. That's the only thing I can say at the moment. Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games. A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent. A game where you aren't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move. Somehow, despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores, I doubt this will ever happen. I will never buy another tournament fighter again. Ever.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Pure bliss for an intimidated noob","reviewText":"My 10 year old son and 39 year old self are having a blast with this game.  Neither of us has ever played a \"real\" guitar before.  We have played guitar hero, but there is just one strum bar and five buttons for frets on those guitars.  For Rocksmith we have a 6 string guitar with 22 frets.  That was (and still is) extremely intimidating to us.Rocksmith came with- USB plug from guitar to my 360- 6 ft HDMI cable- An audio adapter for the 360- An audio cableLucky for me my 360 is plugged into a receiver via HDMI so the only cable I needed to use was the USB plug from guitar to XBox.First thing I had to do was tune my guitar.  Rocksmith walked me through it and checked the tones for me (good thing for a tone deaf guy).  The cool thing (for me at least) was that the software knew the problem before I did.  If I hit the wrong string, it knew and told me to check which string I hit.So I went through about 5 tutorials and tried to 100% them.  The tutorials are excellent.  It starts easy...if you can't get it, then it slows it down to get you used to moving across the frets and strings in time.  For a noob like me, this was great.  The game amazed me when it told me exactly what I was doing wrong in the tutorials (ie: wrong string, wrong fret...it knew).  After you get through the first test, it does the same riff with more notes and complexities.  It allowed me to practice and have a sense of success before it upped the level.You can choose to play lead guitar, rhythm, or bass.  You can use your electric guitar for bass, but I have not tried yet.  I have only tried lead guitar so far but plan on trying the others.There are 20 or so more lessons to do, but I was interested in trying a song (knowing I would fail).  Low and behold, they actually up the level of play on each song as you improve.  So the first time through the easier songs was not impossible even for me to achieve some success.  I felt like \"I can actually do this with some practice\".The part I recently tried was the guitarcade which is awesome.  Retro style arcade games that work on your guitar technique.  The first game is similar to jet pack joyride, but based solely on how loud you strum the strings and control the volume.  The next game is like the old Root Beer Tapper game but you have to hit the right string to \"shoot\" down the right area. I had trouble with volume and finding strings and these were fantastic ways to practice.  It includes high scores, mini achievements, and online rankings.  I also tried the slide arcade and a duck shooting game that helps practice slides, frets and strings.  There are many more arcade games that I have not tried because I don't know the concept (ie: bending) yet.  Some games are more fun than others, but the fun and rewarding way to practice is top notch.The main thing this does not do is teach you to play guitar by reading sheet music.  That was not important to me, but worth noting.We try and limit video game play for our kids, but this game is so educational that we bend the rules and let our kids play Rocksmith at times when they normally are not allowed to play games.I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to learn to play a real guitar for fun.  It provides learning, fun, and a sense of accomplishment.  It will provide our family many hours of fun time together.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Third Time's the Curse","reviewText":"12 years after wincing my way through the originals, I picked up id Software's latest from my local Fred Meyers last Tuesday. By Saturday morning I watched the end credits scroll past my traumatized eyes. Clearly, id went old-school gameplay with the latest graphics in *Doom 3*.*D3* plays like *Quake*. It's dark and alien looking. Doors open automatically or you use the fire key to activate buttons. You have no alt-fire, stealth, lean, or use functions.You do have a story for once. *Half-Life* owes about half its plot to the original *Doom*: both games are about clearing research facilities of teleporting monsters from another dimension, and id did it first. But *D3* plays like a devilish mod of *Half-Life: Blue Shift*. Both titles send a lowly guard to some forgotten corner of a massive research facility. Hell breaks loose as soon as the player reaches their respective destinations. Barney and the \"Marine\" must work their way to a portal to another world. They fix some critical problem in the other dimension and return to Earth for a final battle in some other forgotten corner.That's okay. *D3* is a hard core game. It's also a hardcore system hog-with my AMD 64 FX-51 CPU, my 512MB Registered ECC RAM, and my Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB AGP the game lagged in places, particularly around doors, on the \"High Detail\" setting with 1092 x 768 res. The last few levels just killed my framerate.Speaking of hardcore killing, *D3* is all about overkill. Beginning with the opening scene this game is just plain dark; and I don't mean subject-wise: apparently nobody has heard of floodlights in 22nd Century Mars. Id likes shadows long and deep. Id also likes blood: just about every room the character wanders into is caked in blood. That and red lights and disembodied voices form the primary chills in this game. And to rub it all in, id makes sure that enemies jump out of every nook and cranny, often teleporting all around the character while evil laughter echoes through the area.Id's obsession with atmosphere affects gameplay. What good are shadows if the player can snag night vision goggles or a radar? That's right: the staple of many first and third person shooters is absent. Instead, the player wields a heavy flashlight which doubles as a useless club against the thick-skinned opponents. To use a gun, the player must sacrifice light. This can make self-defense rather challenging.The old-school weapons challenge the player too. Aside from the fancy skins, the weapons might as well date from World War I. Given the anachronistic pistol with its wooden revolver grip and steel semi-automatic slide, I'm surprised the game designers didn't just go for a past/present motif all around. The \"machine gun\" sounds and behaves more like a 1920's Tommy Gun anyways. The shotgun has a semiautomatic bolt and charging handle, but operates strictly pump action. And *D3's* \"chain gun\" fires unusually slowly from a ridiculously limited ammo pool. All weapons other than the BFG 9000, the rocket launcher, and the \"soulcube\" appeared to have the same strength. Even the plasma cannon hit the same as the pistol, shotgun and machine gun.But id's interesting design choices don't stop there. I can see why so many reviewers gripe. The gameplay consists mainly of the following formula:1. Walk into a dark, confined room filled with flickering computer lights. Then:a. A monster lurches out of the darkness.b. A monster teleports into the darkness.c. A ghost whispers something creepy.d. A panel blows out of the floor or wall.2. Next, walk into a dark, confined hallway filled with flickering overhead lights. Then:a. A monster lurches out of the darkness.b. A monster teleports into the darkness.c. A ghost whispers something creepy.d. A panel blows out of the floor or wall.3. Then, walk into a dark, confined elevator filled with flickering touch-panel lights. Ride the elevator into one of the previous two locations.Id varies this pattern with cute little horror movie scripts. Walk up to a bathroom mirror and suddenly a grainy red filter descends as laughter echoes and your reflection ages into one of the hapless zombies you kill. Walk into a control room and loose objects agitate violently, suddenly shooting across the room inches from your face. There are blood-soaked elevators with elevating body parts, skeletons that shift a few feet, bodies dangling from ceiling cables-just all kinds of nasty stuff.Monsters included. *Doom* featured a bestiary right out of medieval Christianity. *D3* draws zoological inspiration from contemporary sci-fi horror like *Alien* and John Carpenter's *The Thing*. Id kept many of the *Doom* names, but the faces are far different, and new critters join the polygonal parade.Little of this resembles the original and its pixilated 2D twitching-torso-on-a-stake decoration. *D3* brings a Satanic Invasion to the 3D realm (cough, cough) with an engine that sure renders light effects. Yet I can't tell much between it and *Far Cry's* Crytek engine. Id has certainly spent years crafting a grim-looking funhouse out of any Dark Castle picture. But Crytek could probably duplicate *D3* texture for bump-mapping for spectral if it wanted to. The only tech difference I detected were *D3's* totally cool computer screens clear enough to actually read, watch, and manipulate in-game.Manipulation defines this black masterpiece. There is no multiple path option, no stealth mission, no player traps to spring. There is only the bloodstained hallway, the hum of a dying fluorescent light, and the total absence of anything safe and familiar. It is you and your shotgun versus Legion. It is awesome when it isn't repetitive.I hate it and love it. *Half-Life* continues to be the PC bar to beat as far as balance and overall gaming excellence. *Far Cry* provides competitive graphic engines and effects. But when it comes to hotrod violence and horror, *Doom 3* is \"it\" in my limited library.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas A. Knisely","summary":"What do people expect?","reviewText":"A successful shooter franchise has made 7 titles with small improvements along the way, instead of major changes, and they have done it again with their 8th release.The makers of Call of Duty know that if you add too much, you narrow your audience, and narrowing your audience means less players which means less revenue.  Battlefield 3 is the closest thing to the line of, \"too much stuff in a game\", while maintaining a certain level of accessibility.  However, BF3 has a significantly low accessibility level, meaning it is harder to just pick it up and start shooting players.  And people who compare MW3 to BF3 simply don't understand that they are completely different games with completely different aims.  You want large levels with vehicles and a more realistic approach to weapons switching and movement?  Play BF3.  You want smaller levels with more action and more weapons and customization?  Play MW3.  These major differences make MW3 a much more accessible game.  But neither of those realities make one game better than the other.Why am I talking about BF3 in a MW3 review?  Because people think that BF3 is the future of shooter titles.  People expect new titles to always deliver something completely new and fresh (which if we are honest, BF3 did not add that much either), but with video games that is not always possible and isn't always smart.  You can't recreate a reliable game engine every time you make a game.  Look at the most successful titles in shooter history.  Quake, Unreal Tournament, Call of Duty, and Halo.  All of these games kept the basics the same and tweaked and added other cool stuff.  Why?  Because if you attract a fan base with a game, you don't want to lose that fan base with your next release by changing every single thing about the game so the few nay-sayers feel like they got a completely new and fresh release.  When I buy a new Call of Duty title, it feels like home, it is familiar, but with new gadgets and strategies to try.  Part of the frustration of buying games like Brink and Homefront is that everything is different, even the controls, so you spend the first week just getting used to the layout and overall \"feel\" of the game.  Not to mention you run the risk of wasting your time if the game is not your cup of tea.  If I bought MW3 and everything was changed and it was barely recognizable as a Call of Duty release, I would be extremely frustrated and would want my money back.  Almost every successful piece of technology in the industry does this.  Groundbreaking new product, like the iPhone, everyone loves it and sings its praises.  Then, with each new iPhone, minor but cool and exciting changes are made.  Call of Duty is no different, and they are smart to ignore the few ignorant people who want to get their minds blown with every release.Imagine if every time you played the sport you enjoyed that you expected new and exciting additions to the game.  Basketball with just one ball?  WEAK, we play with 5 balls at a time!  If you think of shooters along these lines, you will probably enjoy yourself a lot more, and stop feeling like game companies are \"ripping you off\".  MW3 is a solid release, and it is lots of fun.  Everyone that is complaining are like people who expected the new Indiana Jones movie to be an Oscar winning movie, instead of just another fun Indiana Jones movie.  If you set your expectations in the stratosphere, hardly anything will ever satisfy you.PROS:- Weapons look and sound great- New kill streaks are lots of fun- Maps are packed with lots of action (1 or 2 get campy, but play an objective game mode and that goes away)- Singleplayer has a great flow and more opportunities for creative flanks (less \"on rails\" feel)CONS:- Not enough hardcore game modes (these always get added later)- Initially the ELITE stuff did not work right, all of it seems to be functioning fine now- Matchmaking is still touch and go, kind of irritating since this is the 8th CODOverall this is another great game.  I haven't even touched SPEC OPS and SURVIVAL MODE yet, but I've been told they are a blast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

From the great graphics with very high detail to an awesome soundtrack, this game was better than Riven. I read one of the reviews that said he beat this game in one day. No way unless you used a cheat guide. A friend of mine totally ruined this game using the guide and it still took him 12-14 hours to beat the game doing it right the first time. So if it took him a month on the original Myst (It took me about 5 days), then he didn't beat this in one day. This game has many puzzles and they are difficult.The basic story line is that the character you see the most, Saavedro, is upset with Artus's sons who have ruined his world, and blames Atrus for the death of his family. And you follow Saavedro through many ages solving puzzles along the way to try and restore those ages. The ages are as follows:1. J'Nanin: This is where it all starts. The detail that went into this is quite awesome. Your goal here is to get into the 3 large tusks around the island. And that ain't easy.2. Amateria: This is my favorite.

Once there, you have to solve the final puzzle which takes you on a very cool ride.3. Edanna: This one I hated. There was very little light and the trails you were to follow were not very well marked. But what you had to do to solve the puzzles was very well done.4. Voltaic: This was also a very cool age. This age had some of the most awesome scenic views in the game, plus a very cool ride you got to go on.5. Narayan: A very small age. Not many places to go and the puzzles were alot easier than the rest were.This game felt alot more like Myst than Riven did. Like in Myst, you went to one age and solved it and moved on to the next. If you got stuck, touch the linking book and you can try another age. Riven was a vast age and you may solve one puzzle on one island that worked for a different island. Just a mess trying to solve. The cutscenes are nothing special except for you when you solve a puzzle and some of them were great. But the scenery and music were awesome, and they keep adding more animation with each Myst game. The end scenarios (there are 3 or 4 different one) aren't anything special, but neither was Myst's ending. This is the game I had hoped Riven would be, and though I liked Riven, Myst III definitley captures that old familiar feel that Myst had.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2002"}

For those looking for a portable edition of this classic, look no further.  Just like the other games in the Advance series, there have been changes, which we will discuss at length.  First, some information on the \"Super Mario Advance\" series in general.The Gameboy Advance is unique in the Nintendo catalogue as being a system without an original Mario title.  Barring the abysmal failure of the Virtual Boy, the lack of a Mario title has never occurred before or since.  Much like a person without a country, a Nintendo without a Mario just feels adrift and cut off from the rest of the gaming universe and real time gamer economy.Of course, one could argue that Mario IS Nintendo.  To remedy the lack of Mario, instead of developing an original game, instead Nintendo elected to issue the \"Super  Mario Advance\" series, which are simply remakes of pre-existing Mario side scrollers.  There were four total.  Although disappointing that we never got a real Mario game for the Gameboy Advance, the Advance series holds its own as great portable Mario fun, although this strength is primarily found in the original games themselves.  It would have made more sense to use either \"Super Mario World\" or \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" as the inaugural title in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series rather than \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", but that is neither here no there.As I said in my review of the original SNES version, \"Super Mario World\" takes everything Nintendo did right with \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" and only improves and builds upon that foundation.  \"Super Mario World\" features fantastic, varied levels, creative enemies, memorable boss fights (something that Mario is often weak, strangely), secrets galore, and even debuts Yoshi, Mario's ridable steed.  Nintendo scored a huge hit with the \"Advance\" version of \"Super Mario World\", selling 3,290,000 copies in the United States and 5,460,000 copies worldwide.  Not bad for a few little updates and a nifty repackaging of an old SNES title.All four \"Super Mario Advance\" titles include the original arcade title \"Mario Bros.\".  This edition of \"Mario Bros.\" features wireless gameplay if you have another player with a second Gameboy Advance and another copy of the respective game.Here are the following changes.  Although they are legion, they are mostly cosmetic, etc, and the precedence set by \"Super Mario Advance\", which featured some rather sweeping changes to gameplay, was not followed here..Changes:-The biggest (and most detrimental, for me anyway) addition/change is when Mario gets hit by an enemy, he goes to Super Mario, instead of regular, small Mario, giving him an extra hit point.  This change effectivly makes the game much easier-The spin jump has been moved to the L/R on top,-Luigi has been added to the opening cut scene.  There is a new opening Hot Balloon cutscene added-After collecting all five Yoshi coins, these turn into Peach Coins with an accompaning cut scene.-The Boos, Koopalings, Mario, and Luigi all have voices, with some of the Mario/Luigi vocals coming from \"Super Mario Advance\"-Defeating Chargin' Chucks (the football enemy) yeild more points in the GBA version, and Climing Koopa gives you 400 points instead of 100-Players can get up to 999 lives and their save games will retain their extra lies.-Some Fortresses and Ghost Houses have been redesigned to include Dragon Coins- Players start with the last power up they had-There are more message boards present.  In the SNES these boards are called \"Point of Advice\"..  In the GBA version, they are \"Tourist Tips\".  After clearing all 96 exits, the majority of these signs congradulate the player.-A smiling bush represents the Top Secret Area, instead of the yellow level icon in the original-By pressing L & R, Mario can reenter fortresses on the SNES version.  On the GBA version, you must defeat Bowser first, upon which you can then reenter any fortress without any special button combinatons.-Coloured Yoshis now appear in question blocks.After eating a specific amount of items, Yoshi will lay an egg.  In the GBA version, the egg contains different items relative to the coloured Yoshi.  The GBA version also tells you the differences between the coloured Yoshis when you first encounter one of these colored Yoshis in the Star World.-Luigi's sprite is different.  Like \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\", Luigi has better jumping ability than Mario but also has less traction.  He is also slower than Mario. When Luigi rides Yoshi, Yoshi does not initally swallow enemies - instead he stores him in his mouth to use as projectiels.-The Princess Peach sprite slightly differs, with bangs and a lighter dress colour.-After beating the special world and the game map turns to autumn, Mario floats across the sky in a ballon, throwing out Mario masks.  These masked enemies still retain their original enemy names, whereas in the SNES version they were given new names.-Due to having one run button, Mario cannot change directions while flying, or shoot fireballs while hodling an item.-One of the Bowser statues in the Bowser's Castle does not shoot fireballs in the GBA version, whereas in the SNES the statue does shoot projectiles.  Also, the final fight with Bowser now has a time limit.-There are several cosmetic changes in the ending credits, and some of the names are changed in the credits (with people given different or new roles) as well-There are various textual changes, especially in regards to the KoopalingsFor a portable Mario adventure between 1989-2002, \"Super Mario World\" is the best of the lot.  I have read some comments from players whose first expereince of the Mario titles were with the \"Advance Series\".  They were disappointed in \"Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3\", because \"Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World\" felt so much more advanced.  To those unfamiliar with these games, playing \"SMB3\" after \"SMW\" will come across as strange, but that just shows you that Nintendo took an already fantastic game and just made it better.As discussed above, there are numerous changes to \"Super Mario World\", but most are cosmetic.  As the Gameboy Advance is long gone, most gamers will probably not play \"Super Mario Advance 2\" as their first choice if they want to experience \"Super Mario World\".  However, if you see a copy cheap and you have an old DS or Gameboy Advance, pick this one up.  It's definitely a keeper.  Or, just buy the original \"Super Mario World\" on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console.Barring an original Mario [title] game, this should have been the launch title","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

After doing the basic lessons and moving on to the regular ones for only a couple of hours my arms and shoulders feel like I can't lift them anymore.  I'm pretty sure I'll be sore tomorrow morning.This is basically a cardio boxing game.  The rest of the exercises are short games and workouts that are unlocked as you progress through boxing exercises.  It looks like there are 6 regular ones and 4 that use the balance board.  This is the extent of the balance board usage.  None of the boxing exercises use the balance board.  This is a little disappointing, but since you can't jump on the balance board it would be a little difficult to do the boxing footwork which is bouncy, without damaging the board.  Still, I thought the description of the game was a little misleading since the use of the balance board is limited to leg raises, push ups and a couple exercises that are already included with the Wii Fit.Still, I think this is a good addition to my Wii Exercise list because it's engaging and holds my interest and I like games where I can build up the score and compete against my past scores.  Here are a list of the pros and cons that I've discovered so far:Pros:Choice of music.  There are several different music choices that you can preview and play during your workouts.Choice of settings.  You can choose a gym, forest or seaside setting.Lots of movement and easy to understand instructions.You acquire points which you can use to buy things at the gym store, like different outfits.You can pick your trainer (male or female) and there are several different training levels so you can play according to your abilities at a pace that is good for you.Great response time on the controls and great sounds.  \"Pow! Crunch!  Wham!\"  The movements and clicks of the Wiimote register right on.  You can also click through scenery pans and other peripheral scenes to speed the game.  (Thank you, UBI Soft!)Cons:The graphics are a little ragged on an HD TV with component cables and 480p settings.Wii HD Link Component CableThey are also a little simplistic compared to other Wii games, not bad, just simplistic.The balance board is used in only 4 of the side workouts, not in the main cardio boxing.All in all, I still think it's a good addition to my Wii workout collection and it's one that's fun enough that it'll get used often. It's good arm and shoulder exercise that will compliment myWe CheerWii game and a good way to work up a sweat without getting bored.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2009"}

The tournament mode is a little lame, and it would be fun to get more of a reward for a high score.  That's always been one of the best parts of pinball---getting a free game for high scores.  It makes it feel like you are really getting something.  Here, you do get a token for a free game, but since after a bit most of the games have unlimited play, it doesn't feel like much.  It would be neat if there were games you could unlock, or maybe even some sort of minigames you could get.

Every race in the game now takes place at night, which I think is okay, but it would be nice to be racing in day light also and seeing the beauty of your whole car.  The cops are less annoying in this game, because you won't deal directly with them as in Most Wanted.

{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"Well Beyond Solid......Except for \"The Human Factor\"","reviewText":"*This review is based on Beta and whole game play teamed with Valor.*I am not a fan of FPS games.  Never really have been.  There has always been something rather redundant of run, gun, kill, die, respawn, repeat.  However, in light of recent FPS games that I HAVE enjoyed, I gave the Beta a try and was really impressed by the overall enjoyment of the game.  So much so, that as soon as I could, I bought the game.......complaints and all.First off, I want to say that I am getting REALLY tired of the COD MW2 comparisons.  I am not saying that comparisons are unfounded, but let's just say \"I hear you.  COD MW2 is a fantastic game.  Move on.\"  Any time a game breaks, or in the case of COD, MAKES the mold......people are bound to make comparisons.  It happens in all genres, but if you spend your whole life comparing the rest to a single ideal you miss out on the nuances that makes the others enjoyable in their own right.And that brings me to MAG.  What intrigued me about MAG from early reviews is the focus on teamwork and strategy.  Right away, I raised an eyebrow.  However, the very idea that makes this game stand out, is being overlooked by alot of gamers on the servers.  Seriously, dying in the game sucks.  It sucks more to be surrounded by five medics that don't even try to heal you.  It sucks still more to respawn only to (literally) be knifed in the back by your teammate.  If MAG is guilty of having any major flaws, it is this: Very few people out there seem to grasp the idea that working as a team to take an objective is the goal......NOT seeing how many kills you can rack up.  I'll be the first one to lay down suppressive fire, maybe getting a kill or maybe not, in order for a couple of my teammates to run in and blast the other guys without being mauled.  Sadly, this seems to be a rare occurance.  The graphics are solid.  Not as good as some games out there, but by no means would I say they are even NEAR \"bad\".  The sound is decent. With a surround sound, some of the battles erupting really can shake the walls......especially when airstrikes are called.  The controls are pretty easy to pick up and learn, although I occasionally press a wrong button, but hey....that's my own dumb fault.  Honestly, MAG is all around a very good game.  The only weakness I really see is the human factor.  Some have said gameplay is repetitive.  Honestly, it can be.  But the varying game modes helps break up the monotony and truth be told, it only gets tedious when 128-256 people are all out there for themselves.  Don't get me wrong, I have worked with some GREAT players on here, but when I bought the game, I immediately went the route of field support since the BETA was lacking anyone willing to play a medic and having to respawn and run all the way back to the action SUCKS.  I am just fine sitting back and letting a few stupid people run out in to a bee's nest and get killed.  I'll be right behind you racking up exp. bringing you back to life.If you are looking for an FPS with a little more to bring to the table.  An FPS with strategy, teamwork, and truly MASSIVE maps.....MAG is for you.  And honestly, if that is indeed what you want......join Valor and look for shadow_n_shade.

Like some slutty teenager, this game tries to hard to get you excited, but fails. Or maybe I'm getting to old for this? No, kids are all wrong. :P","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNY","reviewerName":"\"greatone222\"","summary":"Forgive me...but...","reviewText":"I know, I may be one of the only people to actually go agaisnt the tide here and give this game 3 stars, but it just feels like it's a year behind everything else. I own and have reviewed over 30 first person shooters, and I play them all on a 2.8ghz, Geforce 4 Ti 4600, 21 inch trinitron monitor and Klipsch 5.1 surround sound...so I feel I have a good idea of what every game I own can do.First, the positives. The graphics are nice, yet a bit choppy at times. The sound and realism is where this game falls short. It's more &quot;cartoonish&quot; than other shooters out there. The sound is TREMENDOUSLY unimpressive. The &quot;planning stage&quot; and waypoints take alot of time, and can bore you. The weapons are ok, but you get most of them right when you start. I'm yet to locate a health meter, or a quick save if there even is such a thing. This is VERY similar to the first Rainbow series. If you were a fan of that, which I am not, then you may love this game. I would look at this more as a strategy game than a first person shooter. It's not that this game is terrible, it depends on what your looking for.On that note, I think recent shooters like Soldier of Fortune II, Jedi Knight II, and Medal of Honor Allied Assault are head and shoulders above Raven Shield. Black Hawk Down is more of a realistic run and gun as opposed to this slow paced cartoonish Raven Shield. I waited 8 months for this to FINALLY hit shelves, and I get a HUGE &quot;Hitman 2&quot; feeling when I play this...if you have played that game you know what I'm talking about. Next time I'll play the demo first.Take care all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2003"}

Death from Above and the Ghilli sniper mission easily stand out as the most memorable gaming event for me ever. Easily that game is a 9.5/10 ( or dare I say even a 10/10 ).CoD4:MW2 was excellent but more of the same and I'd say that is a 8.5/10. CoD:WaW is perhaps an 8/10.That brings us to CoD:Black Ops. I had really high expectations from this game. However, after playing this game, its really more of the same with even louder and continuous explosions and high octane stuff thrown in. Its like a Michael Bay movie every minute with lots of explosions, bullets whizzing by and general mayhem and chaos all around you with annoying screen shakes and annoying chaos. The graphics are average ( no where near MW or MW2 quality ), audio is too loud and annoying at times although bullet sounds are great. The gameplay at its core is still the same with auto lock-on and generally quite good. However, the FEEL of the game isn't as powerful or as drawing you in as MW. The story is really the best part of the game. Voice acting is also quite good.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase ( I got it for $20 cheaper through Amazon's excellent promotion ) because for a $40 game its quite good. But for a $60 game its not. This game will sell however. It'll easily cross $500 million by year end or perhaps even hit a billion. Who knows. But Activision is sure milking it - charging $60 for even the PC version (capitalism at its worst) and will probably soon offer like 3 older maps and 2 new ones for like $20 and people will still buy it. It'll make money and leave a mark in gaming history for sure, but the true people behind it - Infinity Ward who rejuvenated the flagging CoD franchise will start to get forgotten. And perhaps in a year or two, this game will go the Madden way where it'll sell but won't remain as good with like 3-4 hour single player campaigns with still premium pricing.I will rate this an 8/10  ( average and good but not excellent ). Definitely buy if you like CoD and perhaps even if you don't because you will be only the loser if you stubbornly hold out in some defiance.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Didn't realize how much I had missed this genre!","reviewText":"For those of you older gamers who grew up in video arcades playing games like Golden Axe, Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom, and even games like X-Men, TMNT: Turtles in Time, and Final Fight, Dragon's Crown scratches an itch like no other game to come around in a very, very long time. Vanillaware's newest work of beauty is a class-based beat em' up with RPG elements, an excellent character progression system, deep combat, and a very clever infusion of single player and co-op gaming. It's a game that appears quite simple on the surface, but after you spend some time with it, its depth and bountiful riches make it one of the surprises of 2013, and another fine entry into the PlayStation 3's library of exclusive games.The game does a great job of quickly teaching you how to to play, on a basic level, whichever one of the 6 classes you choose to start with. One of the most impressive features of the game is how different each class is from one another. They move different, attack different, progress different, and feel completely distinct from one another. They are so distinct, in fact, that each class makes Dragon's Crown feel like 6 different games. Vanillaware has created a game that you will truly want to replay over and over just so you can try out each character. A serviceable, if unmemorable, story will guide you through each of the game's lush and beautifully hand-drawn environments. As in all Vanillaware games, everything you look at in the game is gorgeous. Animations are smooth and the designs are very creative, especially the absolutely incredible, epic boss fights. You'll find loot everywhere, and you'll constantly be returning to town between adventures to sell your gear, pick up sidequests, advance your skills, talk to the locals, recruit new adventurers to join you on your quest, and receive blessings from the gods. The game creates an very nice dynamic this way between questing and visiting the town, and should make RPG fans feel right at home.Dragon's Crown's co-op system works brilliantly, even if its execution is a bit sloppy. Once you reach a point in your character's story, the option to go online and let other players join your game becomes available, as does your ability to hop into other players' games. There has been some criticism at the fact that the game doesn't unlock online co-op until you progress to a certain level in the story, but I found this to be an excellent idea. The game can be quite challenging, and it's good to know that players who join your game are most likely quite competent at playing their characters. Co-op is a blast, and your partners are usually much more useful allies than the AI that accompanies you in solo play. On the flipside, jumping into other peoples' adventures is a great way for your character to get higher levels of XP and better loot, and makes for a nice distraction from your own single player game, giving the whole experience a good sense of variation. What Dragon's Crown really needs and doesn't have is a lobby. There is no way to send in-game invites to your friends, and grouping up takes some coordination from all involved. A more organized way to group up would have worked wonders for the game.Overall, Dragon's Crown is a fantastic, extremely addictive game that draws you in with its beauty, depth, and very high fun factor. It is fun in the same way those late 80's/early 90's arcade games were, but it also finds a way to bring in all the modern sensibilities you expect from today's games without intruding on that special something that makes beat 'em ups such a special part of the gaming universe. Dragon's Crown is a game like no other, and even with its flaws, it stands as one of the most memorable games on the PlayStation 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2013"}
