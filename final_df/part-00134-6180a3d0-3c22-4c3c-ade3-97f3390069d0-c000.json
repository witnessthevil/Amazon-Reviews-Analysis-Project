{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"Why did Rockstar take a step backwards?","reviewText":"From the moment I heard the name of this game, it caught my interest. Add Rockstar's branding to the mix, and it becomes almost irresistible!  Yet, you MUST resist!The concept is simple: you are a cop in the early 20th century. It's a game by Rockstar, so you expect sandbox game play style.GOOD:* Graphics - Just good, not great - except for the character's faces, he rest of their bodies, the cards, the buildings; they all feel dated. Looks like something out of a murder scene re-enactment from the 90s.* Dialog and story - I like this. It's pretty straight forward, nothing memorable, just straight forward.* Facial animations - one of the best jobs.BAD:* Engine - So far I've ran accidentally ran up a door (yes, a vertical standing door) and ended up on top of a house - you can youtube this.* Driving - sure, I expected the cars to be boring, but what I didn't expect was that OTHER cars can predict when you are entering an intersection. When you enter intersections, going at full speed, cars coming into the intersections perpendicular to you will slam on their brakes in the middle of the intersection. You expect them to not be able to see you out their side window, and that you should swerve in anticipation of them keeping driving straight. Nope. Cars also do NOT obey the street law, that or their logic is reversed. The stop for green lights more than red, and go through more red than green.* Engine - A severe failure is their dynamic LOD system. We've seen this fail on other Rockstar games: usually you are traveling very fast, everything is the, the buildings, cars, people, they just have VERY low resolution textures on them. Well, this is the first Rockstar game I've played where they actually STOP your car when this happens. I don't mean slow things down or halt the game for the graphics to catch up, no, the speed of your car instantly becomes 0 - no adverse side effects besides sucking incredibly. And this happens A LOT.* Truth, Doubt, Lie: Crap. It's just crap. It's more a guessing game than anything.* Sandbox, with no toys: There really isn't anything to do but either drive around marking landmarks (boring), go straight to your Point of Interest, or sit in your car an wait for one of the few non-sequential sub-quests to kick in - and their ain't many of these; most (almost all) end up with you shooting someone in after a boring chase.* You can't drive through wooden fences, or certain objects you'd imagine you should be able to (and can in games 10 years older).* Bugs - on top of the bugs mentioned above, there are more. My partner got stuck trying step over a small wall - I reload.SUMMARY:It's just not fun. It's shooting system is so simple and impossible to fail, that it might make an OK first FPS for someone not familiar with the genre. This game feels like a gimmick, it feels like community service. It might have been a nice game 10 years ago.Games are just sad these days; formulaic and unrewarding. Rockstar was revolutionary for a brief moment in time, now they are just tired.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2011"}

It's already paid for itself compared to going to a movie! The game area is very expansive and but the fast travel system makes for quick traveling.One of the few negatives I find has not changed since the last three AC games (Black Flag is the 6th installment.). The climbing is very dumbed down. For the most part, you only need to find a starting point and you just push up and it climbs for you. Compared to the first AC (and to a lesser degree the second AC), climbing is not so much of a problem solving part of the game. That's just my preference though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2013"}

It's the best because of how it works. The Grand Prix is neat. You start by choosing wich size engine, then you choose the original characters from Mario Kart 64. After that, you can choose Nitro or Retro. Nitro are the new courses (which are ok) and Retro is the old classics form SNES, N64, GBA and NGC. Unfornunatly, some of the retro courses have changed. For example, At Mushroom Bridge, you can't go on top of that thing on the bridge. You can now do battle mode with computer players, which I have enjnoyed.

A great feature and even better it doesn't cost anything unlike other gaming systems wireless options.

For you ATI users simply go to the website and there is a RAGE ATI driver, made just for the game. The only thing i see is a little big of screen tearing. I have it cranked up to full 1080p, 4x AA, so once in a while you'll see it, sometimes not. If i do, i'm engrossed in the game and it doesn't ruin a thing. The graphics look absolutely amazing, and the gameplay fairly easy, yet keeps you on your toes. The AI is quite intelligent, they hop off walls, do flips in the air, come after you with various objects, and call you an S.O.B among other things. I have yet to see any glitches, and i don't think i will. One thing to keep in mind is to make sure your distributable packages are updated, using windows update. Other than that, i can't think of anything else that would cause all the problems people seem to have. The game isn't anything \"new\" under the sun, it's your usual post apocalyptic asteroid hit the earth aftermath sort of game. But that's what a lot of games, and movies are based on today. So don't expect any kind of compelling story. It's just a blast to explore, take in the awesome scenery, and kill off the bad guys. The weapons are very fun as well, aiming is spot on accurate, and hitting them with the wingtip boomerang is actually quit funny. Especially when their heads fly off. As i get further into the game (no you don't have to complete a game to review it in part), i'll update later. So update with the driver (ATI users), Nvidia folks, i'm guessing they have one for you as well. As i said this game looks absolutely amazing maxed out. So don't give up on it just yet.

{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Rhodes","summary":"This is Where It All Began","reviewText":"The year was 1998.  I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time.  A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex.  Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon.  If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days.  Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy.  Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it.  And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled.  You got in arguments over who the best starter was.  Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies.  You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history.  And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did.  If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan.  This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today.  This was one of the heights of gaming period.The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995.  Before the television show came around.  When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter.  I'm not kidding.Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today.  The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival.  Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such).  It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find.  Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion.  The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat.  It was your traditional turn-based combat.  Simple, yet it was so complex.  For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it.  Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses.  For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass.  Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc.  No Pokemon is invincible.  They all have a weakness to some type.  Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.In the battle menu you're given a list of commands.  Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run.  You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn.  It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive.  As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you!  It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough.  It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster.  Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type.  It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed.  On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.Pokemon was no short game.  It was full of all sorts of side quests.  From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon.  There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish.  Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all.  Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours.  In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long.  The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes.Even more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable.  Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions.  You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue.  How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150?  By trading.  Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust.  Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though.  Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.Even more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling.  You and your friends could get together and battle one another!  Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends.  They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers.  It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is.  With your friends it was always interesting.  Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training?As far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995).  On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color).  For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad.  It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations.  The music, however, was fantastic.  The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles.  The only really annoying thing was the sound effects.  They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today.  Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.Pokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000RZPW9W","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Good for a Month","reviewText":"I beta tested the game through FilePlanet and was mildly impressed with some of the features, such as fatalities and the graphics (when the beta wasn't crashing on me). I ended up buying the game with a few friends since I figured the game would end up just being fun with a few glitches at first. After a few weeks, I put in a request to cancel my account. There just wasn't anything new and exciting I hadn't already played in other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or EverQuest. It's been around 6 months since I've touched the game, so I decided to give it another shot so here's an updated review of Age of Conan.Anyone who hates grinding will probably enjoy the power-leveling you can frequently see spammed in the global chat. I'm not really against power-leveling like some, so this isn't a big issue for me. However, if you don't want to do that, expect to do a lot of grinding. Most of the quest are very similar to other MMOs, such as kill X amount of creatures and bring back X amount of pelts. The quest do give you a lot of experience and you'll probably gain a level just turning in quest to a town at lower levels. This game really isn't based on solo as much so a lot of quest you get even at the beginning are group quest. Frankly, I would rather solo for 80% of the game than quest with people. One of the main reasons I got this game was for it's PvP, which I use the Bender approach of \"Kill all humans\". So grouping isn't really that fun to me, unless I can PvP them when we get to the boss. Yes, I'm a jerk. But you need bad guys in a universe to complete it.The PvP is where most people probably jumped into this game. This game does feature some really fun PvP, however, there's just so much wrong with it at the same time. Especially at low levels. Most other MMOs I've played, if you PvP in certain areas, the town's people or guards will come out and beat murderers down. Not in Age of Conan, at least in most areas. One thing that turned off at least 2 of my friends was spawn camping. There's a set spawn point and in some of the lower areas, everything just camps them. So you'll spawn and unless you high-tail it out of the area, you're screwed. Sometimes you'll even see level 30/40s in a level 20 area just spawn camping. A simple solution would be for Funcom to just add some high level guards around the spawn areas so people can at least leave and begin to have fun. I remember some of these areas and if I wasn't able to hide, I would have never been able to play and would have called it quits day one.One thing I was letdown on in the PvP is loot drops. Some PvP games (Shadowbane, for example) offered a hardcore PvP option to make good use of your bank. When you were slayed in battle, you literally lost all the loot in your inventory. This option really should be available in any MMO since there's really no point to PvP in a game unless you can rob their graves. I kept hearing hardcore PvP whenever I heard anything about this game. It's fun, it really is, but it's pointless. There's free multiplayer games that have swordplay and you can show off your sword skills. Such games as Rune. It's old but it still does the trick, and has enough unscripted gore to keep you coming back for more.As I mentioned, there were tons of crashes using Windows Vista with a Direct X 10 video card. Also, there were tons of slowdowns. They've really patched up the game and have made it run silky smooth (for the most part) with everything on high. The sounds are really good, but what sucks is only 1/8th of the quest givers have voices. Anyone familiar with Everquest and the 2GB download for voices know it is possible to read you off all the quest. I really don't care about the Age of Conan story mainly because of the lack of voice acting. It really makes it feel generic, even when they do bother to voice act.There is a single player portion of the game, and it's a little more exciting than the normal grind. I actually would rather just play the single player until I hit level 60, but since I have no idea where to go to finish the single player after I left, so I'm going to have to push some grind.Overall, you have to really think about the purchase. I enjoy the game for what it is, but it's hard to justify $15 a month for something I've been doing the same (and more of) in World of Warcraft. Ultimately, I'd say anyone who has a World of Warcraft account will find nothing new or exciting in this game other than a new world and gore. If you haven't tried World of Warcraft and want something less 'cartoony', go with Age of Conan. You'll have a lot of fun if you've never experienced something like World of Warcraft or EverQuest. And if you want something that's more open than you can handle, try out Sony's Vanguard. It's not the best looking game, but there's a ton of really unique ideas and features.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2009"}

Mostly they're gushy emotional diatribes that have some sort of message like \"give peace a chance\" or \"all you need is love\" or \"don't poop in the tub.\"The weaponry in this game was pretty exciting - but you never really USED IT! Despite having guided missles, automatic assault weapons, and grenade launchers - you spend most of the game with a tranquilizer dart, sneaking around. (In fact, I didn't use the grenade launcher once the whole game!)Finally, the story-line is about as convoluted as it gets. By the end of the game, I really don't know what's been going on.

It's unique mainly in that this one takes all the protocol that restricted Fisher in past games and throws it out the window.You see, after the death of his friend Lambert and his daughter he pretty much hits rock bottom.  As the game starts out you find out that 3rd Echelon, the company that Fisher worked for in past games, is now hunting Fisher and trying to kill him.Now that Fisher no longer plays by 3rd Echelon rules he can now use his abilities the way he(or you) wants to.  That also means that he doesn't have the full inventory of past games, but you still get to use a handful that aid you throughout the game. This is what makes this splinter cell one of the most thrilling of them for me to play.  Being able to sneak around the shadows and take down any enemy any way I want makes me feel more like a hunter than an agent.  The gameplay mechanics work extremely well and very rarely had any problems with them.  The game brings everything together and it is very fun to play.The story is my favorite of the games as well.  The story delves more into the deaths of both his friend Lambert and his daughter.  Everything is tied up and it is satisfying.The visuals are great as well.  Im not going to say that this is the best looking game around but it definitely is the best looking splinter cell game.  Nothing to complain bout there.I guess the only complaints I have about the game will only depend on the player.The game is pretty dang short.  I completed the game in 2 days.  I think my time was from 8 to 9 hours.  It was entertaining throughout the game, but I wanted there to be more.The other thing I didn't like was how often the f word was used throughout the game.  It's not like i hear the f word and Im immediately offended, but when it's extremely overused in unnecessary situations it starts to get old really fast. Throughout the game the enemies would scream it what seemed like every other word.  Again, these will just be viewed differently by different people.I guess that's all I have for the game.  I would recommend this game to stealth/action fans and fans of the splinter cell games.  It might be different, but definitely worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

Definitely one of the best video game series of all times. While RE 4 is my favorite with the remake of RE 1 a close 2nd place, Code Veronica is still a great game.Story: If you remember RE 2, Claire was searching for her brother Chris (from RE 1). The trail leads her to an Umbrella facility in Paris, where she is captured and taken to Rockford Island. Wesker unleashes the T-virus on Rockford so she is let go by the prison guard and tries to escape. After escaping via a plane, the autopilot is engaged by her captors and flies them to a remote island in the Antarctic, yet another Umbrella research facility. After being captured again, you take over as Chris Redfield and try and free her.Gameplay: Survival Horror, 3rd person, single-player. If you have played any RE game then you know what to expect. Puzzles, zombies, boss fights, scrambling to find enough ammo for your weapons. Code Veronica is the first game in the series to use 3D backgrounds instead of the pre-rendered ones. The camera is big improvement from before and it is not just a fixed position. It will move between two fixed points, giving it more flexibility. The quick 180 turn is still in this game. Weapons are standard from what you would expect such as handguns, shotguns, launchers, etc. Some new things include the return of custom handguns parts as in RE 2 and some new ammo has been added such as crossbow arrows can be explosive and anti-B.O.W. rounds for the grenade launcher. If remember the 2nd play through of RE 2, the gameplay of Code Veronica is affected the same way. Whatever Claire leaves in the storage containers is there for Chris to use and same goes for weapons she used or didn't use.Fighting: Killing zombies is the same as in RE 2 & 3. The laser sight accuracy didn't come to the series until RE 4. You can still do the usual- blow zombies heads off, shoot high or low. There is a sniper rifle and linear launcher in the game that lets you shoot from 1st person but everything else in the game is 3rd person.Conclusion: Graphics aren't amazing but still good considering this is a port. Controls are easy as the other RE entries. Sound is excellent. While I enjoy a good challenge in gaming, this entry in the series is one of the most challenging. Try and remember to conserve what you can using Claire because if you don't, Chris won't have anything to use and can make it so challenging that you have to restart and try again from the beginning. The RE series is going to stay in my collection. If you want an updated version of this game, including updated graphics, menus, item placements, trophies/achievements and a leader board system, it was released on XBL and PSN in Sept. 2011 as well as an updated RE 4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

Both incorporate elements of platforming, but it's games like The Forgotten Sands that show which does it harder and just better.  Forgotten Sands is my first Prince of Persia title, although I knew of the series (of course) I just never played one until this.  I was blown away as soon as I started (right at the beginning too) to scour the walls from ledge to ledge!Graphically, this game has a gorgeous CGI created intro movie, and overall the graphics aren't shabby, but they aren't up to par with what a game released this far into each respective console's lifespan either.  I'd say better than DC Universe Online (which, to me, were bad), but not close to Red Dead Redemption by any means.  The consensus?  Good, but could've been better.The gameplay is certainly where Forgotten Sands shines the most.  It starts off with some basic platforming, but halfway through the game -and after you incorporate every power- the platforming becomes truly E P I C.  For me, the only issue with gameplay was the PoP's somewhat clunky combat moves, which seemed too stoic, like someone who was drunk and couldn't quite maintain fluidity.  Just a personal gripe about gameplay-whether it's yours is your issue.Overall, The Forgotten Sands is a game that shouldn't be forgotten, yet unfortunately has kind of fallen into that bin for most people.  I think a lot of diehard Prince of Persia fans still reel in journey from The Sands of Time, but I believe this title is truly an epic title all its own and should be judged accordingly as its own game because, duh, it is.  Despite the dated graphics, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is a king among platforming and action/adventure games.  Oh, and the ending battle and final boss is amazing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}

Posey","summary":"BioShock 2 Review - The Return to Rapture is Similar, But Better","reviewText":"BioShock was one of those games that left a lasting impression on most of the people that played it. Why? It wasn't a state of the art shooter that introduced new things we've never seen before. The weapons were all pretty standard fare ignoring a few. Why then was it such a huge hit? The atmosphere. BioShock introduced us to a new world, one that exists completely under the sea where all of the top minds in the world escaped society to a hidden retreat to do their work unimpeded upon by governments, religion, and regulation. This land of the free goes by the name of Rapture and is run by a man named Andrew Ryan. What could go wrong in a city that sounds so right? Well, if you played the first game, everything. The city erupted into civil war, but not until scientists created something called \"plasmids.\" Plasmids are a sort of tonic you inject into your body that changes your DNA to give you super powers. They come from sea slugs and eventually make you go nuts if you take too many, which everyone does. Without ruining the first game if you haven't played it, it seemed like it was pretty final. Leave it to 2K Marin to prove us wrong.The sequel BioShock, named BioShock 2, takes place in the same city as the first game, Rapture. The game opens with you as a big daddy. You end up having your little sister stolen from you by a big sister. Sophia Lamb, a psychologist in Rapture, starts giving you orders and within a few short moments, you are dead. Push forward 10 years and you're magically back alive. The reason for you being alive is explained in the game so I won't give anything away, but you're now back in Rapture. Sophia Lamb is aware that you are alive and doesn't know why, but wants you dead. She has become some sort of religious leader for Rapture. As a Big Daddy, it's your job to find your little sister, who just so happens to be Lamb's daughter Eleanor. Your journey will take you from where you woke up, to an amusement park warning of the dangers of the surface, to an infirmary, night club, theater, and many new places in Rapture. As a Big Daddy, you will be doing what the Big Daddies did in the first game...guarding little sisters. As you encounter other Bid Daddies throughout the city, you can kill them and adopt their little sister. She will join you willingly and you can either return her to a vent and rescue her, harvest her and kill her (nets more ADAM- the currency for buying special powers), or put her to work collecting ADAM from \"Angels\" (corpses). This is a trade off though as you could piss of a Big Sister by doing so. More on that in a little...That's as much of the story I can tell you without ruining some pretty good surprises. The thing that made BioShock 1 so great was the ambiance/atmosphere of the game. While this game has the same sort of feeling, it's almost like a been there done that feeling. It's not bad by any means, but it's not as new and exciting as it was the first time we all played it. You're still going to be picking up audio tapes, reading scribblings on the wall, and hearing maniacal musings of the city's residents resounding through your speakers. It's all well done and carefully tunes to present a linear, but solid story on what happened to Rapture after Ryan lost control.The enemies from the first game are back with some new ones thrown in for some good measure. You have all sorts of splicers ranging from the common foot soldiers, to spider splicers, lead head, houdini, and big daddies. The new forces, a brute who likes to charge, alpha big daddies, a Big Daddy with a rocket launcher, and the Big Sisters, are all welcome changes. Speaking about the Big Sisters for a minute, they are awesome. BioShock devs said that they wanted to create an enemy you would fear. I can't tell you enough how successful they were. The Big Sisters are not regular forces you encounter throughout the game, instead they are triggered. Whenever you find a little sister, you are given the choices I mentioned above. When you rescue or harvest the little sister, there is a chance a Big Sister will come after you. When she does, you hear a loud scream followed by a warning on the screen that says \"The Big Sister is coming for you, get ready.\" That's when the panic sets in as you put down traps and try to get in a good area to remain covered. When she shows up though, it's on. It's very common to find yourself completely out of ammo and health packs by the time the battle is over...and this is on normal difficulty. Can't imagine it on hard. They are a great addition I would love to see more on in part 3 (although it might be difficult with the story).Something else that's new in this installment is a morality system. It's nothing as major as Mass Effect, but it does dictate how your game is going to end. Everything from killing certain characters in the game after learning about their dark secrets to sparing little sisters will have lasting consequences. It won't make itself known until the end of the game though, besides some extra commentary during. It's a neat addition that at the very least warrants an extra playthrough to see how it would end otherwise.The gameplay is similiar in BioShock 2 but also profoundly different/better. In the previous game, you were a mere human without a dive suit. Guns took two hands and as a result, you couldn't duel wield weapons and plasmids. Yeah, those days are long gone. Welcome to the world of zapping someone with electricity while putting 2 slugs up their ass. It's a great feeling to use plasmids and weapons together and feels very natural. It doesn't take much time to get used to either. The plasmids this time around are varied as well, but not as varied as I would have liked. It seemed that most of the major plasmids are back with not many new additions. This can be overlooked though since you can upgrade those existing plasmids to do cooler things. For instance, one of my favorite plasmids is the swarm of bee's. Level 1 shoots them out onto people. Level 2 does more damage. But level 3 adds a whole layer of complexity to it. When the bee's finish killing someone, they will hide in their corpse as a sort of trap. When someone walks by, they hop out and attack. This is key to many Big Sister battles and it remains one of my favorite plasmids by far!The graphics in BioShock 2 are similar to that of the first game with some minor tweaks here and there. It's a beautiful game, but so was the first one. The environments are going to have you taking closer looks to see how life really was in Rapture. All in all, it's a beautiful game.The game lasted me about 8-10 hours. That's pretty standard for an FPS. You could probably milk an extra couple hours out of that if you aim to find all of the recordings and power to the people stations (for achievements). After you finish the game, you have another option besides playing through it again. BioShock 2 introduces multiplayer into the mix. The multiplayer component of the game isn't anything extraordinary, so if you were looking for a MW2 killer, look elsewhere. What it does do, is offer a unique multiplayer experience that will give you some fun times with your friends.You begin the multiplayer by picking a character. You can pick one of 5-6 different characters, each with a story. After you pick your character, you are taken to your room. In your room you can walk around, interact with things, listen to sound bytes that unlock with levels, change your appearance (masks mainly), and change your loadout. Your loadout can be 2 weapons, 2 plasmids, and 3 gene tonic slots (think perks in MW2). When you're finished, you can enter a game. Most of the crowd are playing the little sister games where you have to find and capture a little sister or hold on to the little sister for the longest to win, but deathmatch type games exist. The multiplayer is fun because it's something different. Using plasmids to set people on fire and then shoot them is pretty cool in a big setting. You won't be playing it 6 mos. from now, but it could be good for a little while. There are some online achievements for multiplayer so if achievements are your thing, you'll need to rank up pretty high to 1K this game.So, is BioShock a good game? Yes, it is. Is it a great game? Yeah, I'd put it up there on the greats list along with the first one. Will it win game of the year or sell unlike any other game? I doubt it. It's a great game, but it's not the legendary game a lot of people were hoping for. The main reason for this is because we've been here before. It's not really the developers fault since there wasn't much they could do. Once the decision was made to revisit Rapture, their fate was sealed. Rapture is still a great city to shoot up, but at this point, the shiny new car feeling is gone. Being a Big Daddy and protecting little sisters is cool and everything, but we've seen this being done before. This is a small complaint though as the game as a whole is amazing, this is just one thing standing in it's path of even more greatness, if that makes sense.So, should you go out and buy this game? I say yes. If you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Even if you haven't played the first, there is a lot of enjoyment to be found in the second. You may not get some of the references to the first game, but it does a pretty good job explaining things. Some references, like when Lamb refers to the \"WYK Experiments\" would be lost on people who didn't play the first game (WYK = Would You Kindly) but these are few and far between. The multiplayer is a neat distraction that may provide hours upon hours of enjoyment for some, but only a minor distraction for others. It's good, but nothing revolutionary. After completing the game, I'm excited about the possibility of a third BioShock. While the original developers who made BioShock 1 were not the team behind BioShock 2, 2K Marin did a good job in their place. No matter who handles the third, I'm sure we'll have a great game regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game. Every house, hut, castle, and dungeon can be purchased if the player wishes. Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic.

Never has a game placed so much weight upon your choices and actions, and never has an action adventure game rivaled the likes of the ever mighty Zelda franchise. Yes, Fable 2 definitely holds its own in the action/adventure genre and even rivals the fun and joy of the Legend of Zelda series. The beauty of Fable 2 is that you actually get to decide *how* the world will turn out, how people will see you, and how your story will turn out.Will you be the lovable, legendary hero that is praised and loved by all? Or will be you the wretched and ruthless murderer that everyone fears and runs from? Or, will you be that slothful glutton, the greedy swine who cannot get enough treasure and pleasure? The choice is up to you, and that is exactly why Fable 2 succeeds where other 'choice' games fail. I cannot stress this enough: in Fable 2 your actions really matter. Virtually every choice you make shapes the world of Albion and the way you are perceived by those that live there. Not only that, but your actions will also shape your appearance and that of your trusy, faithful and fully realized and lovable dog companion (more on him later).On games that offer the player moral choices: There have been quite a few games lately that offer the player moral choices. Bioshock, Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Fallout, and Jade Empire are just a few of them. Some, like Fallout do it really well, however most of the 'choice' games don't. In most of them you can be really naughty but still 'redeem' yourself at the end of the game, thus nulling any consequence. Fable 1 was like that, but thanfully Fable 2 is not. Your choices really do matter, and they really will shape the world.Fable 2 starts you off similar to how you started off in the first Fable game, as a child. The actions you do as a child will help shape future events and to a smaller extent, your disposition. In one instance you are tasked with finding 5 gold pieces and there are two ways to do this. You can either help random townsfolk with duties, or you can seek out five arrest warrants for a guard. No matter what option you choose you will get 5 gold, but each choice has a different outcome! If you ignore the warrants' quest the future of that town will be very different. Its features like this that really propel Fable 2 above the herd.After that small segment you will be taken 10 or so years ahead, and this is where the game really starts. There is a main quest but no time limit, so you can literally put it off and explore the many wonders of Albion if you so choose (however some regions will not unlock unless you fulfill certain quests). Unlike Fable 1 Albion is massive (about 10x the size of the first game). While Fable 2 does not offer a truly open-world experience (the is still contingent on forcing you to walk on somewhat limiting pathways), it is almost there. Everything has been spread out more, which does in effect make the world feel open-ended. Unlike the first Fable you can now hop over fences, jump down ledges and you really don't feel confined to any path. But, those dreaded 'invisible walls' are there, and you will often wonder why you can't climb over some ledges and hills. Still, there is plenty to explore.On towns and cities: There are a number of towns and small villages to explore and interact with, and some gamers will find that they will end up spending a great deal of time just there. You can buy virtually every building, shop, food stall and shack in every village and town/city. You can either choose to live in them, or you can rent them out and earn a steady income. A very cool feature about renting out property is that even when you are not playing the game you will still earn income from it! You can literally spend your time being a landlord, or a slumlord! Buy up all the property in a village or town and jack up the rent! But be careful, doing something like this will greatly increase your corruption meter (more on that later). There also are furniture stores which allow you to buy new furniture for your homes, which will greatly enhance the value and the asthetic look.Another new feature in Albion is the ability to get jobs to earn gold. You can either forge blades as a blacksmith, pour brew as a bartender, chop wood for farms or seek out bandits as a bounty hunter. The first three jobs involve pushing a button when a meter reaches a certain point, and fun as they are they do get kind of repetitive and boring. But hey, its a job, right? The bounty hunter jobs are your basic 'seek out and kill' missions. Still, its nice to have the option to earn gold by other means and doing well at your jobs (for blacksmithing, bartending and wood chopping) will boost the towns economy.There are various shops and merchants scattered about Albion in which you can purchase and sell weapons, clothing, food, doggie items and other goodies. The shops and merchants are your standard fare. If you've ever played an Action/RPG or a traditional RPG game then you know what to expect. They sell/buy stuff, and in turn you can sell/buy stuff.There are also travelling game masters and game masters in bars with which you can interact with and play \"Pub Games\" (gambling) to earn more money and become an expert gambler, or deep in debt. The gambling side games are really fun and a nice way to take a break from questing or even a hectic home life!Fable has always been about living out a faux social life and interacting with the various towns/village and other folk living in Albion. Similar to Fable 1 you are presented with a multitude of expressions with which to interact with everyone in the world. You start out with a basic set, but more expressions can be earned through reading various books and living a certain lifestyle. If you follow down the evil/corrupt path certain expressions will unlock, and the same thing goes for the good/pure path. The expressions range from downright silly (the fart expression, the arm pump expression, sock puppets expression) to those of the seduction variety. You have expressions for social situations, for romance, and you have expressions that are aimed at angering people and making them fear you. You also have a few expressions that are only used on your dog.Speaking of your dog, he is one of the most living, breathing and most animated AI video game creations I have ever seen. He looks and acts just like a real dog, and I think you will grow to love him right away. You cannot directly control your dog, but you can interact with him. You can find a rubber ball and play fetch with him, you can scold or praise him and even teach him new tricks. There are various books scattered about Albion that offer tricks and abilities you can teach your dog. Your dog will even aid you when you are in combat. He can never die, but he can get injured (which can be fixed by feeding him doggie treats). The dog is a very cute feature in Fable 2 and has been executed very well. He also acts as a treasure finder. If he scouts out a treasure chest or other valuable he will bark and take you to where it is. He can also find 'dig spots' where buried treasure lies. He will spot enemies before you do and will growl to alert you; he is a very helpful companion.On the Good/Bad, Corrupt/Pure meters: Like Fable 1, there is a Good/Bad indicator which shows your current moral standing in the game. This is pretty straight forward: Do good deeds and act like a saint and your meter will slide towards Good. Do evil deeds and act like a devil and your meter will go the opposite way. Pretty basic right? Unlike Fable 1 there is a new meter which shows your Corrupt/Pure standing in the game. Raise the rent on your properties and watch your slider go towards corruption, lower the rent on our properties and watch your slider go towards pure. Cheat on your wife and watch it head towards corruption...well you get the picture. Like I said earlier, EVERY action shapes your character and how the world perceives you.On sex and family: Yes, you can have sex with men and woman in this game. You can even chose whether or not you want to have protected or unprotected sex, which means you can purchase condoms. If you have protected sex then nothing really happens (your corrupt/pure meter might shift a little). But chose the unprotected option and you may end up with a child, or an STD. In Fable 2 you can start a family, move into a home and live the married life if you so choose. However, you have to keep your family happy or they will leave you, just like real life! And be careful about trying to seduce or flirt with other woman around your wife/husband as they will not like that too much. Thankfully you gain an 'apologize' expression during the course of the game. The whole family option of the game is really neat, and very 'The Sims' like. You can cheat on your spouse, and they can cheat on you. You can have multiple wives, but I wouldn't suggest having more than one in the same city/town/village, or chaos might ensure!On combat: Combat is very simplified for Fable 2. Each different combat style (Melee, Ranged and Will (Magic)) is assigned to one button. This may seem too simple at first, however at higher levels it gets pretty intricate. You can unlock blocking abilities and even combos for melee attacks, zoom in functions and body part specific targeting for ranged combat, and higher, more powerful level attacks for magic. Melee weapons range from your average swords to cleavers. Your melee weapons range from cross-bows to guns and rifles, and there are about 7 spells you can unlock and use. There are special 'augments' you can get for certain weapons as well. These 'augments' basically buff certain stats and are somewhat useful.On leveling up: Fable 2 is more of an Action RPG than a traditional RPG. You are not assigned a level as in a traditional RPG, rather you get experience orbs from combat. These orbs can be cashed in to enhance the three areas of combat, increase your health etc. To be quite honest this system makes the game a lot more enjoyable for the casual gamer, as you don't have to spend time hunched over stats and the menus.On Co-op: Fable 2 offers the ability to have a friend join your game and play along, however this is where Fable 2 finds its most annoying pit fall. While its true that a friend can easily plug in a second controller and jack into your game pain free, they are limited to selecting from a list of pre-set characters who have pre-set dispositions. Oh, and they cannot ineract with anything in your game world. They cannot talk to anyone or do anything besides kill things...boring. Also, co-op via Xbox Live is available too, however the same problems plague that as well. You can't even import your own character over Xbox Live, making the co-op worthless. It is my hope that Lionheart (the game developer) releases a patch that changes this in the future. As it is right now, Co-op is NOT worth it, unless you are looking to pacify that bored girlfriend or friend (instead of them just sitting there watching you play...you game hog!)One really cool feature that Fable 2 offers is the ability to see every other Xbox Live gamer in your game. Basically they appear as a green orb that holds their gamer picture, and you can literally watch them move around in Albion. You can even hear and chat with anyone that has their mic turned on, which is a really neat feature and pushes the game closer to 'MMO' status. You cannot necessary play or interact with them, but you can view their in-game stats. If you start a private chat with a friend you could technically play the same quests together, but that is about as close as it gets. Overall this is a really nice feature as it lets you help each other out if you are stuck.The bad:While you can buy clothes and fully customize them there is a very limited stock in Albion. You basically stuck with a few outfits, much less than Fable 1. I really hope they release more outfits in the future. Oh, and there is no armor in the game. So put that out of your head right now. The only cool feature with the clothing (so far) is the ability to purchase and find various dyes and color your clothes to your liking.The difficulty level is very low, meaning that any casual gamer can pick the game up and play like a pro. In some cases you will find yourself in trouble but not often. Oh, and you cannot die in the traditional sense either. You do have a health bar and it does indeed drain when you get hit, however when it reaches zero all you do is get knocked out only to get back on your feet again. This may annoy the more 'hardcore' gamers as it appears that there is no consequence to dying, however there is. You earn scars that will make people view you as ugly, which may make it harder for people to like you (unless that is what you are going for). Take that as you will.The main quest is somewhat short (about 10 hours), and the ending is very anti-climatic. This can be viewed as a bad thing, however there is so much to do in Albion that those measely 10 main quest hours can easily be extended if you take time off to raise a family, play the real estate market, explore the world, hunt for treasure, interact with the various folk in the world, become a professional theif, a murderer etc.The graphics can look pretty odd at times, and there are various glitches that can randomly plague the game. Though other than that the graphics are gorgeous, very cartoony, and very fitting for the game. You will literally get lost in the sunsets and shadows that Albion has to offer. There are also various distinct regions with their own look and feel as well, and even all 4 seasons! Character models are very cartoonish with big hands and odd feet, but otherwise look superb. Animations are decent, not the greatest but they serve their purpose.The real shining gem of Fable 2 is the dialogue, the voice acting and the story lines. They are all very well done and you will find yourself believing that Albion is a living, breathing world. The voice acting is probably the best part, being voiced with real British accents, giving the game a more authentic Medievil feel. There is so much humor injected ito the game (some of it really dark) that you may find yourself chuckling along too.Final thoughts: Overall Fable 2 is a shining gem that actually does (for the most part) live up to the massive hype that preceeded its release. There is much to do and much to see, and you will certainly have lots of fun doing it all. Since the game reacts to you differently depending on which alignment you choose (good/evil pure/corrupt) there is the opportunity for multiple playthroughs. Action/RPG Life Simulator fans will mostly get the most out of this game, while the ADD twitch based gamers will probably plow through the main quest in one night. Keep in mind that the point of games like Fable 2 is to simulate a life, that is you should spend time interacting with the world, build (and destroy) relationships, have a family, fully utilize all that the game has to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

It looks and runs great on the Xbox One.  The only issue I have with it is lack of content.  It's a multiplayer only game so content is very much needed.  It does have a horde mode where you and your friends can play against a horde of computer players.  However, there isn't enough content for the horde mode.  They have added some recent content for free to make the game bigger.  But it could still use more.If you're looking for a shooter for your kids, this is a great one because it's not gory or graphically real like most shooters.  There's no inappropriate content for children.  It has less cartoon violence than the old Warner Bros cartoons!  I notice a lot of kids playing the game so parents apparently approve.It's PvZ in spirit but if you're looking for true Plants vs. Zombies, this isn't it.

The story has a very interesting twist very close to the beginning.  I didn't see it playing out the way it did.  The deceptions don't stop there.The graphics look similar to Uncharted 2, but the characters are rendered even better with much more detail, especially their faces.  3-D looks great with no apparent degredation in visual quality.A great level is the Ship Graveyard.  It's a very creative design and challenging to play.  It's something how Naughty Dog can make tons of rusty steel look so beautiful.The action is what you would expect from the Uncharted series.  There are action/adventure sequences along with some puzzle solving.There have been a few changes to combat, but controls are the same.  There's no more Brutal Combos or Steel Fist.  Square attacks.  Triangle defends and Circle breaks a hold and throws an enemy.  X jumps.Some familiar enemies such as the riot shield thugs are back and a new enemy, the Brute, which makes Drake look child-sized.  The challenge is you must go hand-to-hand with these goliaths.If you've played the other Uncharted games on Hard difficulty then you can expect the same here.  Crushing difficulty isn't available from the start.F.Y.I.  I found 49 of 100 treasures on my first play through without spending much time looking for them, rather following hunches about where I would find them.  This first play through, on Hard difficulty, took me about 12 hours.  I received 21 of 54 trophies.  Only 2 trophies are multi-player related and 1 is achieved by completing the game on Crushing difficulty.  The 2 multi-player trophies are achieved by completing one co-op and 1 competitive game each.It was fun from beginning to end and the ending by no means concludes the Uncharted series.  It's only up to Naughty Dog if this is the last we see of Nathan Drake.  If it is I would be surprised.10 out of 10.  Awesome!Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

The artwork of the packaging is generic, and one of the main selling points of the game is the ability to give voice commands to your team, and kind of works but it feels like your trying to navigate through a phone tree in order to finally speak to a human operator after a half hour to finally learn what your credit balance is. However, this game rocks! Once I got into the storyline of the game, I was immediately hooked. The gameplay is solid, albeit predictable, but a lot of fun. This game reminds me of another SEGA game recently published, Vanquish. The gameplay isn't as good as Vanquish, but the storytelling and awesome sci-fi/action-movie feel makes the game totally worth playing. If that isn't enough, this game has a one-liner dropping french robot! I would say the best aspect of the game is the plot, which is engaging, and something that very few games do well.Overall, Binary Domain succeeds with a great storyline and excellent storytelling. Characters are fun and likable with cheesy dialog reminiscent of good, old school B-movies and throwbacks to numerous science fiction films (see Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Robocop, and Terminator).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

Then the Xbox 360 controller came out for Windows and, well, there's not much to say other than it's a 360 controller that works on your computer. The layout and functions are exactly the same, and if you are playing a Game for Windows enabled game you can use your controller like you would on the Xbox. The home button pulls up the dashboard, and the game will recognize it like if it were a 360.Other games tend to recognize it as well (if it supports a game pad) and I have had no problems with it so far. I do wish, however, there was some type of profile manager that allows you to use it for games that don't support game pads. You have to result to third party software for this (Pinnacle Game Profiler is perfect). The installation was painless and there's just not much to it. You can use a keyboard or mouse port, but this confused me since peripherals are all moving toward USB now. There is a USB adapter, but including the mouse port seemed a little early 2000's.You can also use the controller on your Xbox so it's like having two in one. This is great if your short on controller and want to play multiplayer. The cord has a generous length and the force feedback works swell if the game supports it. There is even a port for and Xbox LIVE headset for online play.

I fell in love with the idiosyncrasies of the game as much as the structure, the art design, and music. And like a Spielberg summer blockbuster, every few years a new Final Fantasy title comes out to wow it's base of loyal fans, and maybe draw some new ones.  When I heard there was to be a XIII, I decided to buy a PS3, because I knew no matter what, that the bar would be set high.For graphics and sound and animations, yes.. very high. Every vista stuns, every cloud, bush, bit of fog, wisp of hair is painstakingly rendered in sparkling perfection... but for story, structure, concept? This is the thinnest, lamest Final Fantasy ever.  Anyone who ever played Square's 'the Bouncer' knows what I'm talking about; Run down a hallway/fight something/watch a cutscene/do you want to save?/repeat. It's a fine formula for a brawler, but a bad one for an RPG series that's known for diversity of gameplay ideas.And that's not the only meat that's gone. Unlike older Final Fantasies, there is no deeply convoluted, layered storyline, here.  Everything is black and white to the point theres almost no need for dialogue. Coccoon is good, Pulse is bad, Fal'cie force quests on people and arm them with magic to carry them out. Pulse Fal'cie create Pulse L'cie who have to destroy Coccoon.  Coccoon Fal'cie create Coccoon L'cie who have to destroy Pulse...If those last 3 sentences grated on your nerves at all nothing can prepare you for the hours and hours you're going to have to hear those same terms repeated over and over till they become maddening jabber.What else is gone?  A Worldmap, towns, shops (there's a \"streamlined\" online shop feature), NPCs, side quests. None of those fun side jobs to enjoyably kill time. All there is to do is run or walk in a mostly straight line to the next point on the map, and don't worry about returning to anyplace you've visited either, there's no airship.  Just push forward on the pad and fight. And fight.Fighting is actually kind of fun.  For veterans of the series, the combat is a fast paced 'slam' affair where you designate teams with different jobs to different members, and then switch them on the fly. It's fun to watch, though you may not feel like you're really DOING anything after awhile.  As you progress, you have to use more status enhancements and status attacks to get the edge.I didn't finish this game.  Now before the fanboys start howling, listen- I'm 42, I work for a living and have other things to do, ok?...I gave it 25 hours and I've had enough. I frequent videogame forums extensively and nowhere have I heard that the game gets amazingly better after the first 25 hours, or that the ending makes up for the grind.  I don't think anymore should have to wait more than 25 hours for a videogame to pick up.  It's supposed to be entertainment.I bought a PS3 so I could play this game, and it's a dumbed-down excuse for an game that took years to make. Give it a rent, friends.

No complaints with the sound at all - though its hard to screw up this aspect of a video game.Cons: None reallyControls:Pros:If you've played any of the Call of Duty games then you will be vastly familiar with the control scheme. In fact, the controls follow the typical FPS console style - so players should have no problems adjusting to it.Cons: None that I can find.Game play:Pros:Overall, the game play is pretty tight. Levels transition smoothly into the next, and the fire fights are so intense your heart will be pounding, your hands will be sweating. There will be plenty of moments where you will feel hugely outnumbered and stuck in a corner, flanked and suppressed. I strongly recommend playing the game on either the Hardened or Veteran difficulty - this will stretch the game out considerably; the two easier difficulties are WAY to easy. On the harder difficulties the enemies are much more unpredictable and their bullets do much more damage.Cons: The campaign is really short; something that seems to be a re-occurring thing with shooters these days. However, if you play the game on the harder difficulties you will experience the \"true\" campaign.Also, there is no co-op! This is not excusable, especially since we are in the 7th generation of video gaming; co-op (both off and online) should be a standard. In fact, 4 player co-op should be standard. BIG failure on the game developers part.As far as a storyline goes:Pros:Um, well you get to play in a modern warfare setting.Cons:There's not much for a storyline at all. In most FPS there is hardly any story line depth. The just of it: you play various characters in a war setting.Multi-player:Pros:This is the meat and potatoes of Call of Duty 4. The campaign is merely practice for the online. This IS the reason to get this game. No matter what game type you enter, the battles are always intense and hardcore. You can call in air strikes and helicopter support, and each map really feels like a battlefield. The game types range from standard free-for-all deathmatch to team deathmatch, capture the flag, secure the base, and a few objective based missions.Also, the online portion incorporates some RPG elements. Every match you participate in (if you get kills) earns you Experience points that go towards your ranking (they use army ranks), and your weapons experience. The more you use a weapon the more exp you gain for it. There are also specific challenges you can partake in during online matches. Fulfilling these challenges earns you more exp. Furthermore, there are also different \"perks\" that you can earn as well; such as Juggernaut (more health), \"last stand\" (before you die you have the opportunity to pull out your pistol and make your last stand), and a slew of other juicy ones that add much replay value. You can also select between different classes (sniper, assault, heavy weaponry etc..), and you can even switch classes in a match. You can also create your own custom class.Cons:Sadly, online co-op is missing...Overall, if you are into FPS and you have Xbox live, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is THE game to get. The campaign is quite fun as well, but it does not justify a $60 purchase alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2007"}

So i picked up mario kart and mario 64 and they were both great games, then i post on gamespot.com's forums which game i should get next. they keep telling me animal crossing. I havent played the gamecube version at all. So i eventually bought it (it took me a couple of weeks because it was all sold out everywhere). A couple of minutes into the game, it was very fun. It surprised me how good it was.Graphics 5/5 These have to be one of the best games from a graphical standpoint of view. They are realistic, but there cartoony which i kind of like.Controls 5/5 There are two sets of controls use the stylus or use the d pad with the a,b,x,y buttons. I perfer the stylus. its really easy to get into.Sound 5/5 the sound is excellent in the game. From the crushing of the snow to the calm sound of the ocean. If you are annoyed by the animal talk that they have or the music that i dont mind, you can just simply turn down your volume.Fun 5/5 As we all know the original animal crossing from what ive heard is very addicting. Its the same concept here. Its pretty much the exact same game from the gc version and the same storyline. You are a human sent to this animal town. you work for this guy nook cranny that builds you a house and you have to pay the morgage. Along the way you met new animal friends and you can fish, catch bugs, and dig fossils, and upgrade your hous. Eventually you do run out of things to do everyday so you are only going to play this game 1-2 hours a day at the most. The best feature about this game is the wifi. Its pretty fun, you can visit your friends house or your friend can visit yours. You can have up to 4 ppl in one town. Animal Crossing for the Ds is a really good game. I reccommend you buy it for any DS user.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2006"}

No","reviewText":"You'd think people would have learned by now this is not the 1990s unfortunately and game companies no longer design for gamers they design them to turn a profit so yes only 1/3 of the campaign has been released but there is still a complete multiplayer package.  Blizzard is only attempting to do what the guys with those endless Halflife adaptations tried to do a more in depth storyline which means a shorter time between release dates, although if Blizzard manages to cut down the wait time they would be the first.  After all why give people what they want immediately if you can keep them on the hook.Also depending on how one feels about the other factions the fact that you could have whichever side you want could be a good thing.  The humans were always my favorite the Protoss were pompous jerks who deserved what they got and the Zerg just gave me the creeps.  In my case not having to spend 10 missions as a walking Cockroach is something of a relief.All of the narsayers at least need to find a way to play the game first before they find a reason to trash it.People gripping about the single player campaign  would be justified if the storyline wasn't so well done.  Although I am probably just biased here the developers were watching a lot of Firefly when they worked on this thing. The single player side of things is very fun the gameplay is still there the only annoying factor that I can find so far is that every mission has some form of timed element (usually centered around collecting resources) that is part of the old gameplay I miss building up a strong defensive line and building up your forces for one massive strike.The complaints I have are more of a customer service variety.  For as much as I liked the gameplay Sure Blizzard dropped the ball more then once in the way they handled the issues.1.  Do you really need to know that I am playing this game every single time I log in?  What if I forget my password?  Oh right, now that I have registered my product online I can download it for free anytime I want.  Darn decent of you Big Brother allowing me to download a game I have already purchased.2.  One has to be online all the time with this.  Fantastic what if your internet connection goes out?  Depending on where you live this could be a big issue.3.  Gameplay-I mean yes I like it but even though they gave the game some good voice acting and a shinny new coat of paint it still plays like a cross between Warcraft 3 and one of the Warhammer 40k games.Overall-Yes all of the issues that everyone is frantic about are a problem but there is a lot of good stuff here as well.

Fans of the all time best \"Symphony of the Night\" will absolutely LOVE this title.Aria of Sorrow does the best it can to mix in the best of the old with the best of the new.  Aria of Sorrow borrows TONS of elements from Symphony of the Night and anyone who enjoyed that one will love this.Aria of Sorrow begins in the year 2035 with Soma Cruz and his childhood friend Mina in Japan.  Suddenly an eclipse opens up and they find themselves in Dracula's castle.  Surprisingly enough, it really looks no different than it did in say... 1797 (Symphony of the Night). It bears a strong resemblence and any Castlevania fan will notice all the different places (Libraries, Catacombs and the like).Gameplay in Aria of Sorrow is very close to SOTN in several ways.  Your character resembles Alucard in the way he looks and walks.  Perhaps what separates this from the past two GBA releases is that your main character doesn't use the whip as his primary weapon.  Actually, you don't really have a primary weapon.  You can use, Swords, Daggers, Axes, Javelins, whip swords and more!  Its fun to experiment with all the different weapons to see what fits you best.  The strongest weapon may not always be the best.Since, Symphony of the Night, Castlevania has gone into an RPG style character building stage.  This is for the better and Aria of Sorrow is no different than the past games.  As you kill enemies you'll eventually level up.  It doesn't require too much to level up (at least not as much as it takes in Circle of the Moon).Aria of Sorrow also has well balanced difficulty.  It's harder than Harmony of Dissonance but easier than Circle of the Moon.  Aria also throws in a unique twist.  You can now absorb enemies souls at random.  When you kill an enemy you may or may not get their ability.  There are over 100 enemies meaning that the game even has more abilities to unearth than the DSS System allowed you to in Circle of the Moon! Most souls cost MP and that brings me to my first con.  The game has a lot of souls but for whatever reason they cost A TON OF MP to use.  Granted your MP regenerates but it regenerates REALLY slowly.The game also presents lots of bonuses.  You can unlock a sound test and a hidden character to play through the game as.  There's also a boss rush mode and perhaps whats best is that you can link up with a friend and trade souls!  Perhaps one bonus I would've really enjoyed would've been if they'd brought back the ability to play as different \"Jobs\" like in Circle of the Moon. But its still a really cool experience and the game has lots of replay value.Visually, Aria of Sorrow is BEAUTIFUL!  Your protagonist stands out in a crowd and the screen isn't so dark.  One of the better looking GBA games that truly stands up to what the GBA is capable of.I wish I could say the sound surpasses all else.  Castlevania is known for having good soundtracks.  The music is WAY better than the godawful soundtrack of Harmony of Dissonance, but it can't hold a candle up to the far superior soundtrack presented in Circle of the Moon.  The sound effects are incredible and fun to listen too.But Aria of Sorrow is not without fault.  The most noteworthy con in Aria of Sorrow is that this game is short!  It'll only take you 5-6 hours your first time through.  The second is that while its harder than Harmony of Dissonance, its still rather easy for any Castlevania veteran.Overall, Aria of Sorrow is an INCREDIBLE game. I still think \"Circle of the Moon\" is the best GBA release and its no contest that \"Symphony of the Night\" is the all time best but Aria of Sorrow comes AWFULLY close to being as good as those two.The Good+AWESOME Gameplay, collecting Souls is creative+Good Soundtrack+Large Castle to explore+Much more \"free\" than other Castlevania games (you're not limited to one type of weapon)+Lots of Secrets+Konami is smart to model this game after \"Symphony of the Night\".  If you liked that game then you OWE it to yourself to pick this up.The Bad-Still a little too easy-Souls cost a little too much MP-Too Short","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2004"}

I think the developers should've worked a little bit longer on the game to work out a lot of it's glitches.  They also should've given a more wider variety of missions to do for people instead of constantly collecting water for someone or collecting alcohol to make molotovs and such.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Creation27","summary":"Strange Unecessary changes, but still the BEST YET!","reviewText":"If you're a Halo fan, then you will eat Halo 2 for breakfast.With smarter A.I. that have personalities (like getting revenge on you if you shoot them, and very smart/fiting taunts if you miss), a more expansive amount of maps, terrain features, and of course  VEHICLES(!!!), Halo 2 is the next step in XBox's domination of the First-Person-Shooter/Multiplayer market.The story line will keep you captive until the end, then it will cut off your hands and slap you with them.

And this is a darn abominable shame, because the game itself is actually a lot of fun.First of all, the game loves to crash on me when I least expect it.  When I visit Beast/Forge's shop and choose the \"see equipment\" option, the game will sometimes kick me out to the title screen!  And if I haven't saved my game in the last 5 seconds, bye-bye unsaved progress!  The same thing tends to happen when I'm using the Danger Room computer, or using an Xtraction Point to change my team: the screen will go black, and I'll find myself back at the title screen.The Hero Stash is another source of frustration.  You're allowed to keep up to 60 things in there, but I've discovered that anytime I exceeded 15, all the equipment from Beast/Forge's shop that was for sale would just vanish.  That's right; Beast/Forge would suddenly just stop selling stuff to you (except for potions and the Grab Bag), and I could not get the shop to start offering stuff again, even after I got rid of some stuff from the Hero Stash.Also, you probably noticed that defeated enemies and breakable objects often cough up tech bits and, more rarely, armor and equipment.  I've noticed that all this stops right around the end of Chapter 2: I can't get any money (tech bits) from that point on, no matter how many enemies I beat!  How the HECK am I supposed to buy potions and armor and equipment without any money?All these bugs have screwed up my save data permanently several times already, and I've had to start the game over from the beginning each time, hoping that I can do something differently each time to avoid the bugs, but no such luck.  Frankly, I'm now sick of trying.What was Raven Software doing with this game???  Did they even have a Quality Assurance department?  Hey Raven, you guys NEED to come out with X Men Legends 3, and you NEED to address the bugs.  That's the ONLY way you'll make up for releasing an UNFINISHED game onto the market.

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew","summary":"Bad controls, bad camera","reviewText":"I don't know. Maybe earlier God of War games had the same problems but I really didn't like this game that much. Possibly in part just because the series has gotten stale (if you have played a previous game, this one is exactly the same but not as good). Maybe I was able to over-look problems with the game earlier that I can't anymore.I read a review and they loved the game and said the controls were great. They played a different game than I did. In my game, there are many (many) instances of the controls just-not-quite doing what you want. I mean, you see what happens on the screen, you swear, you look at your controller to see if you WERE pressing the buttons/sticks you thought and... you were. The game just wasn't doing what it should. An example: &lt;SPOILER> The game ends with a boss fight. After awhile you are fighting two enemies at the same time. The game gives you spears to throw. I pick up the spears, and press FORWARD at the enemy I want to hit but the spears won't shoot at him. The game does this many times. I got mad and quit fighting the final boss (and eventually quit the game without ever beating him because I hate the controls and camera). The controls are often stupidly frustrating for no reason, like if you roll out of the way of something, after your roll your character just stands still for awhile. He just stands there. So, if you rolled out of the way of one attack, and are being attacked again (happens a lot of course) you can do NOTHING BUT STAND THERE for awhile. The game is pretty easy (on normal, what I was playing) so you can overlook this... mostly... but that doesn't mean you don't hate it every single time it happens (so you are hating the game every minute or two because of bad controls).The camera. Lots of times the developers incorrectly thought the game would be made better if they zoom out really far so you can't see what is happening. That is stupid and frustrating. However, the rest of the time the camera is mostly OK. Mostly. Lots of times it is hard to see what is going on because it zooms in too close, or too far, or is angled slightly wrong. Like the controls, the camera isn't HORRIBLE (except when it zooms way out for no reason) but it is something that makes me ANGRY at the game and not want to play it.I think every game should have perfect controls and perfect camera. If you can't do that, you shouldn't make games. I am sure it is very hard and takes work to do, but do it. I can usually forgive a lesser game having controls/camera as bad as this one does (they aren't super-horrible) but this is a \"triple A\" game. They should figure this stuff out. If the question is: \"it looks slightly better like this or it controls and is fantastically more fun like this\", the game developers should choose the more fun, better controlling option EVERY TIME.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2013"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player. The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"The Incarcerator","summary":"Vast Atmospheric Gem","reviewText":"I was really surprised when I initially played Alan Wake.  I wasn't expecting a game whose control schematic worked so well with the in game action.  Pulling the controler's trigger to focus a flashlight's beam on a goul really felt good in my hands.  The game itself is divided into 6 acts and while I'm only just through the 3rd, the game feels large in scope - easily giving the player at least 15 hours of play.

A ferocious race, now extinct, has left behind relics of their once powerful warrior culture. Now bounty hunters from across the galaxy are racing against each other in order to lay claim to these relics hoping to harness their power for themselves. It's the race of a lifetime, as you guide Samus to the relics before other hunters can reach them - and use them on her.","reviewerName":"SuperGamecube64","summary":"A multiplayer experience that's worth hunting down.","reviewText":"I still remember that day I got my first DS - it was 2 days after my birthday, and I had specifically asked for everyone to just give me money so I could get a DS and a game for it. This was back when there was only the large, original DS. That morning, my grandmother took me for school early so we could stop at the store and get it. I was personally planing to get Animal Crossing: Wild World to go with it, but they didn't have a copy at the store. After several moments of contemplating my options, I purchased Metroid Prime: Hunters. Even thought it was the first game I ever got for the system, I still play it on occasion on my 3DS even now.Metroid Prime: Hunters takes place between the games Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2. The Galactic Federation receives a telepathic message saying that the key to \"ultimate power\" resides in the Alimbic solar system. They transmit this signal to Samus Aran and ask her to investigate the matter, however, 6 other bounty hunters intercepted this signal and want to claim this key for themselves. Some wish to protect it from falling into evil hands while others want it for their own selfish desires.The graphics in Metroid Prime Hunters are obviously not quite as good as the Gamecube duality that came before it. Things are a little bit pixelated, but overall this is a great looking game. The effects are still very much present, such as fogging of the visor. It's certainly just as immersive as the others in the series, even if it is handicapped by a handheld.In the story mode of Hunters, you may freely travel between 6 different planets and stations. The goal is to find all the octoliths, which are the keys spoken of in the telepathic message. The problem is that the other hunters are also looking for them. If you encounter another hunter, which can happen almost anytime after the initial discovery battle with that hunter, you must fight them off before continuing. Occasionally, you will have to fight them in order to take an octolith they have found. Overall,the system works, but ti can become a bit annoying. This game is also much more action oriented than previous Prime games. You will still do plenty of exploration and item collecting, however.This game can be a bit daunting to control at first, but you will get used to it eventually. Either shoulder button made be used to fire, while you aim using the stylus by moving it on the radar of the touch screen HUD. This means you will be holding your DS with a single hand. All of the controls for changing to morph ball, switching weapons, etc, are located on your touch screen HUD. At first, your hands will become tired, but they will grow used to this system over time.The main draw to Hunters is multiplayer. I know that may be shocking, as Metroid has long been a solo experience (with the exception of Prime 2's minimal multiplayer mode). The multiplayer in Hunters actually surprised me! Nintendo made a very in depth system. You may change your scree name, keep track of your stats, and add friends (via friend code) or enemies (via request after matches). There are a plethora of match types, from standard death match, team deathmatch, capture the flag (or octolith, rather) and many more. You can even chat with other players, but this can only be done while in the lobby and only if you have them added by friend code. I understand the friend code part, but why no in game chatter? Unless you're playing with your buddies in the same room, you cannot communicate during the match to tell your team mates where enemies are or share strategies. It really would have added to the game, I think.In multiplayer, you may be any of the 7 hunters. Each Hunter has their own, personalized HUD and visor as well as a special weapon. While any character can pick up and use any weapon, the weapon will only has its special effect if used by the appropriate hunter. For example, any player may use the Tesla Coil as a great distance weapon to keep enemies at bay, but when used by Sylux it also steals their health and adds it to your own. Each hunter also has their own unique morph mode, and a few have other special talents. For example, Spire can walk through lava without taking damage.With multiple game modes, 7 different characters, and 26 maps this game rivals console shooters such as Halo. even now, in 2012, the game has an active online community and it is easy to find a match. But be warned, you may want to find a dedicated community on the internet and just play with them. If you don't, you're likely to encounter a whole heaping helping of people cheating with action replay devices.Metroid Prime: Hunters is a great example of what Nintendo can do when they really put their minds to something. I hope that Nintendo makes a game with this much online content again sometime in the future. They also did a wonderful job of translating an established console series into a portable form. With an active online community, and a cheap price tag, it's hard not to recommend this game to anyone with a DS system who is looking for a great multiplayer experience. It's hard to recommend it for the single player, however, as you are unlikely to come back to it once you have beaten it and unlocked all stages and characters for multiplayer use.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Even after reading the reviews i still needed to get it for myself and prove that everyone was wrong, but they weren't. Assassin's creed does have amazing graphics. (although, not as good as the darkness.)But it is to repetitive. It kind of reminds me of the hitman games. The only problem is you use the same weapons and the replay value is a 3/10. When you play the game once, trust me, you really don't want to play it again. If you decide to go through and kill people they want stay dead which is also a problem. Which makes it really pointless to kill people. After that there really is no fun in the game. the only reason I'm giving it a four stars is because I like the storyline and the graphics, but the gameplay kind of sucks.

Slowly the reviews began to pour in, and although the game was (overall) pretty well received, most people seemed to agree that it was just a lukewarm gaming experience. I don't spend $60 for that. Now, ff to present day. The price has dropped significantly, so I finally gave it a spin. Overall- I have to agree with the lukewarmers. Overall it's an okay game. Very similar to GTA, but less graphic. Sure the language is R-rated, but it seems a bit contrived. The violence seems very tame. The gameplay is repetitive, and not altogether that fun. As has been observed by others, the Nazis have an uncanny ability to spot you (even...no, especially...in disguise??), track you, and kill you. The nudity is cool, but I paid for the DLC before realizing the game came with a freebie voucher for the DLC in the box. Lame. All in all, an okay game. If you pay around $20 for it, you'll likely get your money's worth. If you pay more than that, you'll suffer buyer's/gamer's remorse.

I had at least 9-10 hours playing the Single Player Campaign. In the game, players will commandeer several vehicles, and each is a great ride, from piloting to shooting. This was a lot of fun, although it seemed shorter than KZ2.I bought my copy elsewhere than Amazon because I had a gift card.The graphics are top-notch. I strongly suggest playing KZ2 first, as the story and the weapons will be known better to the player (although KZ2 has two very hard missions at the end.) The level designs are awesome, with the Helghast taking cover and being real pains to root out. You'll also get to use the right weapon for the job.One nice change over KZ2 is the addition of rearming depots in most of the levels. This allows the player to use the ISA weapons instead of switching to Helghast, like in KZ2. One thing I missed, however, was the statistics listing - there are no stats for the SP campaign, ah well.Overall, this was worth the price of admission.

The Donkey Kong Country series went portable with DK Land, Rayman was a surprise full of perfection, and Vectorman appealed to Sega Genesis players with its colorful pre-rendered graphics that DKC had done. All of these games were great, but Yoshi's Island was the best of all. While Rayman would have been my favorite game of all time, it suffered from the most extreme difficulty EVER. Yoshi's Island has amazing graphics, catchy sound/music, awesome gameplay, AND forgiving difficulty alike.This is not the average Mario game, but rather is it what fans would call a Yoshi game, since it plays a lot differently. As Yoshi, you romp through levels like usual, but now you can throw eggs at enemies, as well as eat enemies to make eggs. There is also a huge variety of obstacles, like boulders, loads of unique platforms, collectible flowers, the enemies doing all kinds of stuff, etc, etc. But the thing is: It is all well-crafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences. Don't believe me? Go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage. One look and you'll agree that it looks beyond terrific.There are also some bonuses in the game to help you on your quest to defeat the evil Bowser Jr. For example, there are small houses that you may possibly find in a level (It requires a key, though). Once you are able to enter in, you must compete with an enemy in a certain challenge (Collect most coins, Pop most balloons, etc). There's also bonus challenges when the goal chooses a flower you had collected (In a roulette-like way).Overall, it's definitely one of the greatest platformers I have ever played.

If you haven't got this game try to get the Kollector's edition. Now the future last summer I saw the trailer for Mortal Kombat Rebirth & I was like OMG WTF!? It just looked like some fan fiction BS. Baraka was a plastic surgeon gone mad. Reptile had a bad skin condition that I looked up it's real. You had Scorpion helping Jax & Sonya. Johnny Cage was a failed action star so helps the special forces & is killed by Baraka. I saw it I was thinking they're going to ruin Mortal Kombat. Then I heard about the web show. I saw it & it gave me some hope for a new movie a little bit. They actually stuck to some of the source material. 1st episodes were decent 3rd was good ep 4&5 were alright. 6 sucked 7&8 were very good. Episode 9 the director decided I'll show it at Comic Con. I don't know when episode 9 will be released I might  buy Mortal Kombat Legacy when it comes out to give more in depth thoughts on it. I think it could be as good as the 1995 adaptation. So I'm done with The MK series I'm MK'd out. I'll review other thing maybe movies or go on & review wrestling ask which 1 should I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002BSA3EM","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"Great concept for the technology available at the time","reviewText":"This Wii add-on and software package was one of the most interesting and fun ways to play games and still get a little workout in.  The overall construction is very stable, allowing someone as heavy as me to climb on and dance, stretch, and lean my way through countless games, exercises and challenges.  The board itself rests on four floating pegs, allowing it to adjust to carpet variances.  I would not, however recommend setting this device on an uneven surface - as the floating pegs only have a little big of give and are designed to keep the board propped up - vs leveling out the board.  Four batteries are needed to power this device and unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it - it takes 4AA batteries.  Instead of using a power cable or some sort of proprietary battery pack, Nintendo opted to let the owner decide how to power this device.  Want throw away one-time use batteries?  Go ahead.  Want to use rechargeable batteries - that works too.It is fairly easy to link to the Wii and requires only a push (or kick) of a button located on the side of the device.  Once initiated, it works like a remote control, allowing you to move cursors and accomplish challenges designed specifically for the balance board.  No, you can not use this like a remote in all games - and a real Wii remote is still required for most of the games/exercises that work with this device.The material is a fairly porous material that, while keeping you from slipping off, also seems to trap dirt from your feet.  It is highly recommended that you wear socks while using this device or you opt to clean the board often as it builds up grime.  There are aftermarket covers for the board to help keep it &#34;clean&#34;, but those have varying levels of success in actually keeping the board as sensitive to your movements.The gyros in this board are certainly good at detecting even the slightest level of movement.  There is a Zen breathing game, where your only task is to sit still and breathe.  Sounds easy right?  Well, come to find out the average person moves muscles in their bodies constantly and it takes a lot of effort to train to sit still.  This board detects even the slightest of these movements and helps you to focus your efforts through feedback on the screen.  Cool concept.Granted, the other two gaming platforms (XBox and PS) have come out with their own means of tracking human movement (cameras, etc) that are even more revolutionary than this balance board, but for its time - it was a great little device to add to your Wii collection.I could certainly recommend purchasing one of these if you own a Wii.  Stop simply playing games from the couch when you can play from the middle of the floor and get a little exercise to boot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Great","reviewText":"Ever since I got into gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require VOIP, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I'm not really used to using headsets with my consoles (except for the mic/headset for my Xbox 360 when playing multiplayer games).  I didn't know how I would like using a console headset when I have 5.1 surround in my room already.  But let's get into the specifics.In terms of comfort, this was easily the most comfortable headset I've used in awhile. I have a large head and a lot of times headsets can give me a headache when first using them because they scrunch my skull.  That's not the case with this headset.  It fits comfortably and will be even more comfortable as time goes by.The sound quality is fantastic. The psuedo surround sound sounds good, though it can't compete to my receiver.  But it does a great job of balancing talking with game sounds, so that I'm never constantly changing settings (of which there are 8 presets).  It's very nice and sounds great.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending over $200 on a headset. The XP400 is very durable. I like the way the mic works and bends.  It's also detachable.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. No one complains when I talk and it pairs well with my cellphone and no one complains with that sound either.Pairing the headset with everything worked really well.  It has about 15 hours of battery life.  If you're looking to spend in the neighborhood of $200, then this is a great choice in headset.  But I would recommend the XP510 if you're looking to spend this kind of money.  It works even better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Neccesary but it cost more than you'd like it to.","reviewText":"When I say this is expensive I'm referring to the list price, not Amazon's price (some places even sell it for 40 bucks).  Now that I've cleared that up let's talk about why this is not only essential for your PS2 but why it's so much better than the one we got on the PSOne.First, this memory card has 8,000KB of space! I don't know about you but that single memory card has lasted me longer than any PSOne memory card (which I had to buy four of because that was only 15 blocks!).  The second best part is that some games can save more than one file without taking up any extra space! Some games create a file soley for the game on the memory card and I can save 15 different files no problem!  So you won't have to purchase a second memory card anytime soon.Sports games (and Socom 2) can use quite a bit of space though. Some sports games can use up 1/4 of the memory card, so watch for that. Still, you'll only use that amount once.  Socom 2...that's a different story. That takes up more than 3,000KB (just thought I'd warn ya).The problems.  Well of course, there's the list price. I only need to pay $25 for my controller so why would I want to pay nearly $40 for the memory card? Again, I'm referring to the list price NOT Amazon's price. I think the price at Amazon is quite fair.The second problem is that you can't save PSOne data onto these cards. A PSOne game won't even read them! Yet you can still copy data from a PSOne memory card to this (NOT a good idea though because you can screw up your PS2 Memory Card).If you want to enjoy your PS2 you'll HAVE to buy this otherwise forget saving and all that stuff.  It's a good investment at least.The Good+8,000KB of space and I'm still on my first one!+Games don't take up that much spaceThe Bad-Doesn't save PSOne games-The List Price is kind of high","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2004"}

White \"Ttay\"","summary":"Solid game, great RPG, but a little short of some of its amazing predecessors.","reviewText":"This is a good game - if you like RPG's or the series, absolutely get the game. I'll consider specific parts of the game in turn.The graphics are amazing and the game offers many hours of gameplay. There are a good bit of videos, but they are stunning.The fighting system is both good and bad. I highly dislike the departure from choosing every move in turn, and at times the 'autobattle' option makes it seem like you aren't doing much at all. I won't say there isn't strategy, though. Switching between paradigms is very important and isn't as simple as you might think for some battles.The story is good and it has some interesting themes. However, the story does seem a bit lacking in some ways. Again, it is better than most games, but in comparison to other FF games, it is not the best. For example, you get an idea of what your goal is in the game, but the game never presents a way to achieve it. So, while each piece of the game is interesting, you don't exactly know what you're doing. It seems like you just end up at the end, not exactly knowing why you ended up there or how it is solving everything.Also I wish there was more extra content/side quests. For example, in FF10, i loved blitzball and played it a ton. Here, there are missions you can do (quite a bit of them) but they don't amount to something as fun as blitzball. Also, there are no 'ultimate weapons' that you can do things to get, which is a little disappointing again.Also, as a lot of the major reviews say, the game is a little too linear.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2010"}

The whole open world aspect was a reason why I loved the series. I also thought the battle system would be hard to master. Then I picked up my copy and my doubts were soon washed away. The game is stunningly beautiful, great story.Im still getting used to the new battle system but it isn't a big deal. It might have been a big risk straying away from what made the series great but sometimes a long running series needs to come up with something different besides characters and story.I love the fact they combine the random battles seen through 11 with seeing your enemy as seen in 12. This makes it easier to avoid (in 12 it was sometimes hard since you can be in battle of the time).I love the characters so far as they are compelling (with maybe an exception).Now the reason why I didn't give this a perfect score. The linear aspect. Sure it isn't that bad, but gone are the days when you can just run around doing whatever you like..whenever. At one point you do have an open world but thats more then half way into the game.Get the game if you love the series, but remember this isnt like past game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}

All the landscapes, woods, castles, corridors and rooms have great visuals and you find yourself looking around as you stealth your way through whatever mission your taking on. There are endless possibilities with what you can do and how you do it. Being stealthy and eves dropping is the funnest thing to do, and much better than chasing someone down to kill them. Or even fighting them head on. So far i possessed a horse, bird and a fish to sneak into certain areas i've needed to get into, although something ate me when i was the fish and i had to go back repossess it LOL. Using swords to slit throats is a lot of fun, or just breaking necks with no weapon. This is by far, as i can tell a 40 plus hour game, with endless possibilities and replay value. As i said i've only played for about 6 hours so i haven't used many spells or taken on any huge foes. Just getting a taste of it. If i waited to write a review after i was done it would probably be at the end of the year. Being that i don't have a LOT of time to devote to gaming. I will update the more i play, but i think after what i've put into it thus far i'm getting the general idea. If you love stealth you'll love this, and if you love having like 10 choices on how to execute a plan during a mission you'll love this as well. The controls are a little tough especially when you possess something that flies, it can actually make you a bit sick. But still awesome. Story wise there is a lot going on, but i don't do spoilers. Play for yourself and see. Also the cut scenes look AMAZING! I also may download this for my PC, although i don't see how graphically it could look much better. Everything about this game, has game of the year written on it. Without a doubt. Once it coxes you in, your hooked. Time for bed now. ;o).Btw this is a game my gf, (and your own) probably won't mind watching you play since it has so many endless things to do. And also Xbox 720, and PS4? Who needs it when you have games that play and look like this. These systems have another good 5 years in them, if not more. ENJOY!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Marshall W. Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"As close to being on Hoth as you'll ever get...","reviewText":"Overview: As a long-time Star Wars fan, I've always loved to try the newest Star Wars game. From the original vector-based Star Wars Arcade game on, there's just something about being able to tap into an universe that you're already familiar with. Unfortunately, like many licensed titles, these have been hit and miss over the years, though the hits have been many on Nintendo consoles. Rogue Leader is no exception, setting a new mark for excellence in a Star Wars game. While fans of the more technical TIE and X-Wing shooters on the PC might find this a step down as far as gameplay is concerned, most Star Wars fans will come to the agreement that no game has captured Star Wars so well visually. No other early GameCube game comes close to the visual splendor to be found, and very few play as well to boot.Graphics: 10.0  One word sums up Rogue Leader's graphical prowess: AMAZING! No game I've seen on any platform has caught me more by surprise than the graphical beast that is the Rogue Leader engine. While I suppose that I shouldn't be all that surprised, Factor 5 did some great work on the Nintendo 64 after all (Rogue Squadron & Indiana Jones & the Infernal Machine in particular), I suppose that I just wasn't prepared for the leap they were able to take from the Nintendo 64. Not only are the ship models extremely accurate to their motion picture counterparts (I've read specs that state that they're actually MORE detailed than the 3D models used in the Special Editions), but the textures are top-notch. The level of detail is also amazing. Not only have the environments from the films been effectively recreated (one might argue that some even look better), but the little things, such as stormtroopers running around and turbolasers firing in the distance as far as the eye can see, convince you at times that you are actually there. Via the GameCube, Factor 5 has basically accomplished in real time what fans have been wanting for years...a chance to PLAY the movie. Sure, I might be exaggerating just a bit, but I will not be guilty of underrating Rogue Leaders visuals; they are that good. Besides, as a long-time fan of the classic Trilogy (hey, I've played the Atari computer version of Star Wars Arcade!), you'll forgive me for that. Impressive...Sound: 9.5  If you've ever watched a Star Wars movie, you'll know what to expect here. The sound effects, voice-overs and John Williams' trademark soundtrack are all here, and in fine fashion. Thanks to the mini-DVD medium, a Star Wars game on a Nintendo system has never been better. In the advent of the surround-sound home theater, Rogue Leader's ProLogic II surround sound is also welcome. While you have to have a newer receiver to be able to take full advantage of the format, it still sounds very good on my older ProLogic receiver, so good in fact that you can hear the TIE's coming up from behind. It's hard for a game that LOOKS this good to blow you away in the sound area, but let me be the first to say, that Rogue Leader *ALMOST* pulls it off. Most impressive...Gameplay: 8.0  Where many licensed games fall short is the area of gameplay, and there has been more than one Star Wars game to fall prey to that trend. Fortunately, Rogue Leader manages to play extremely well: controls are well-laid out and responsive, while the design, which can be difficult, never seems that overwhelmingly difficult. That being said, there is very little new here. It's basically Rogue Squadron with better graphics after all. Right? Not quite... While the play mechanics of the original are basically unchanged, there are two areas that have been improved upon GREATLY: 1) SPEED & 2) AI. In Rogue Squadron, there were points in the game where you just felt like your X-Wing was literally CRAWLING across the sky. You won't have that sensation here. While your ship still never seems to move as fast as you need it to (remember, the TIE's are faster than just about anything the Rebellion has...even the A-Wings can't quite do it), the sensation of speed is there, particularly when skimming over the surface of a Star Destroyer or some other large-scale obstacle. As for the AI, I'm not so much referring to the forces of the Empire as I am your fellow Rogue Squadron members. You can't depend on them to do all the work, but their reactions to your commands are responsive, as you can actually see them doing the order you just issued.Theme: 10.0  This is a Star Wars game, and if that says anything, it's that there are thousands of (rabid?) fans waiting for more realistic immersion into the Star Wars universe than games have allowed. While Star Wars Galaxies promises role-playing in the classic Star Wars universe early next year, no game captures the speed and epic scale of the space battles of the Star Wars films like Rogue Leader does right now. The scale of the game, the size of the Star Destroyers and Death Star, the swarms of TIE Fighters, it truly is one aspect of the Star Wars experience on a grand scale. With the space expansion of Star Wars Galaxies well over a year away, no other title puts you there like this. You'd need your own astromech droid for it to be any more convincing.Overall: 9.5  While launch titles are almost never considered to be representative of what a hardware platform is capable of, it's hard not to think that Factor 5 has been able to tap into the GameCube's capabilities at an unrivalled degree. By staying with the formula that had proven successful on the N64 with Rogue Squadron (and the lest touted Battle for Naboo), Factor 5 has been able to refine the gameplay for a game that's ultimately very easy to just pick up and play, but difficult enough to master. Perhaps the biggest compliment that can be given to the game though, is that once you have mastered it, you might just want to take it for another spin, if only to take in all the beautiful scenery.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2002"}

R1? it felt very akward and i wished i could have remapped it to R2, but no such luck. you can move your crosshairs with either analog stick which actually gets a little confusing, especially if you happen to move one by mistake. i died a little too often because of these poorly laid out controls. using the move is far preferable, and honestly, point and shooters are so rare now, who wouldn't want to play this way for kicks? using the move peripheral enables this game to be played in a fashion that suits it far better than the dualshock controller.this game was already great, and now it's been elevated to the next level with a plethora of wonderful additions. this is by far worth the price. with new weapons, trophies, and levels, this is ideal for 'hod: overkill' fans and newcomers alike!(i wish i could comment on the 3d capabilities, however i do not have a 3d tv. if i have a chance to play it in 3d elsewhere, i will update this review at that time.)100% recommended!*** *** ***i found a couple of things i wanted to add to my review.one: the load times seem a bit excessive.two: the move peripheral isn't as sharp as the wiimote was for the original. several times i have had the crosshairs directly over a zombie or a bonus item, even shooting that spot multiple times, and it still does not register. there is significant 'drift' as well as a difficulty getting each shot to register as you pull the trigger. i suppose this could just be my move set, but i thought it worth noting. on the wii version i had an average of 80%+ accuracy, on the ps3, my accuracy has been around 52%. either i have started to suck far more, or there is a learning curve here with the move accesory.i just thought these were worth mentioning. i still love the game though!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006NYWLLI","description":"","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"Definitely a must have for Vita owners","reviewText":"Much has been said about this game on other platforms so I will not repeat it here. Suffice it to say this is Ninja Gaiden Sigma for the PS3, on a portable. Think about that for a second - A PS3 game on a portable. Yes, that game was actually a port from the xbox, but still. The size and scope of this game on a portable device just blows my mind.  While the port itself isn't flawless, the fact that it's the original Ninja Gaiden in all its glory on a portable device makes up for it. This game is just as good as ever, and includes the sigma add-ons to boot. Now, for the Vita specific stuff...Anyway - so what are the changes? Actually they're quite few. Gone is the goofy \"shake the controller to power ninpo\" mechanic on the ps3, replaced with a slightly less goofy \"press random spots on the back touchpad of the vita to power ninpo\" mechanic. Turning on the Karma counter has been moved to a menu item since the button it would have been mapped to is not present, and going into first person mode is achieved by touching the screen, which works, but I find myself occasionally touching it by accident while moving the camera and this can cause me to drop into first person mode occasionally when I don't want to. More annoyingly, the action button (for opening doors, boxes, etc) has been moved to the circle button, which causes me to occasionally lose an arrow when I accidentally fire it instead of opening some box or door. This is annoying, but not a huge issue.Generally the new touch applications of the vita are implemented somewhat haphazardly. As mentioned, you touch the screen to go into first person mode - ok fine. Firing the bow can be attempted either like it always has with the right stick, or more weirdly by pressing the spot you want the arrow to go on the screen, which seems like a good idea, but can lead to some weird effects, especially if you have fat fingers.  You can also aim the bow (or just first person mode) by moving the vita around itself via the gyros, but if you're like me and have the right button axes reversed, this mapping follows into gyro movement and makes completely no sense - you tilt the device up and the screen view goes down. What was really needed was separate options for this control mapping and the right stick FPS mapping. minus points for lazyness.This isn't the only touch screen weirdness either. The save file select function is accomplished via touch, but ONLY this - no other menus are touch enabled - which is completely rediculous. This is the kind of thing that should be all or nothing, otherwise, it's just confusing.Gameplay itself is just fine however. The framerate is smooth and there are no noticable changes beyond what was already done in Sigma, so those of you familiar with that game will be able to jump right in and kick ass. I have a slight suspicion, though not anything confirmed, that the difficulty was toned down a notch - I'm currently playing on 'normal' and find my self blowing through battles that would normally be a lot harder - say for instance the motorcycle guys in Tairon - seem much easier than they used to be. On the other hand, Spider Clan ninjas are just as hard as ever, so maybe not.Speaking of gameplay -  for all you wimps out there there is a wimp mode called \"hero mode\", which is laughable. Unlike earlier iterations of \"ninja dog\" mode which required you sucking a lot before it was unlocked and came along with constant insults from Ayane, \"hero\" mode is accessible from the start and basically makes you invincible. After your health gets below a certain level, you basically auto-block and have unlimited ninpo, which removes nearly all challenge from the game.There is also a hard mode which I haven't tried yet, and I suspect an \"ultimate\" mode as there was in all previous versions of the game, but as I'm still in chapter six, I can't comment yet.Overall, this is an average port of an excellent game. I can't think of too many people who haven't played the original ninja gaiden, but if you're one of them, this is an excellent time to give it a shot. For those of you who have played it and want something to tide you over until NGIII, or want some quality NG on a portable, this is where to get it. The only complaint at this point would be the price, but soon enough that will likely drop.4 Stars - minus one for stupid touch UI decisions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00B3PDHBU","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Best video game headset I've ever used","reviewText":"After about three weeks of usage, I can safely say these Turtle Beach XP510's are the best headphones I've ever used for gaming.  When considering sound, functions, options, and comfort, these simply can't be beat at this price range (and I'm guessing more expensive headphones might still not be as good as these).  I've used many video game headsets from Turtle Beach, Creative Sound Labs, Tritton, Monoprice, and others, but these are the hands down winner among them all.The first thing you notice is the slick presentation.  They come in a lavishly made, embossed box that holds the headphones and all the accessories in one stylish case.  You'll look forward to prying these out of the box each time you get your game on.  These are also the most comfortable headphones I've ever used, and this is continually a major issue for me.  Even when I've used other headsets that sound great, they get cumbersome and extremely uncomfortable after only minimal use.  There is some nicely stitched padding on the head ring, and the ear cups are soft and plush like those of a pair of nice Sony monitor headphones.The sound that pumps through these is amazing.  Like their corded counterpart, the XP Sevens, these headphones produce a perfect mixture of highs, mids and lows.  I've found that most video game headsets in this price range cater to the bass fanatics more than they should, but this pair of phones just get it right.  There are eight different presets that will cover whatever situation you're in.  I tested tested these with Skyrim for the Xbox 360, Black Ops II for the Xbox 360, Bioshock Infinite for the PS3, and Tomb Raider for the PS3.  The ambient noise in Skyrim, the explosions and helicopter chatter from Black Ops II, the clang of metal in Bioshock Infinite, and the lush jungle sounds of Tomb Raider were all perfectly presented and I used a different preset for each one.  Really stunning detail, and I've never heard their equal.The bluetooth function works like an absolute charm.  I used this with my iPhone 4 and iPad 3, and it all worked like a charm with minimal hassle or headaches.  I had no problems hearing the other party on my phone, and they heard me just fine as well.Another nice bonus of this headset is it comes with all of the cords you'll need.  I can't count how many times I've broken open a pair of gaming headphones and realized I needed to purchase a separate sound enhancer, optical cable, or whatever.  It's all here, and you won't need to scour the internet for what you need.The best part is that this is a wireless set.  That fact alone, mixed with all the other factors, is what makes these the absolute best headphones you can buy for under 300 dollars.  Turtle Beach's XP Sevens are just as good as these sound and comfort wise, but those are wired.  If you're going to spend the cash, why not get a nice wireless set and free yourself of hassle and cords?  I've had no trouble with connection, wifi, or signal issues, and sound mixed with voice integrate flawlessly through the wireless connection.  I've experienced no lags, drops, or distortion, even whilst cranking the volume and speaking into the mic at the same time.  Perfect.I've used at least 20 headsets in the past five years, and these are quite simply the best I've ever used.  Sure, they're pricey, but if you want the complete package with no detail uncovered, these are the hands-down pick you need to make.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2013"}

I had some fun with the PSP version so I rented this title for my PS3.  I was very disappointed.As you probably already know, Ridge Racer is an unconventional racing game in that you must master the drifting (letting your car slide through corners) in order to win the races.  In other words, you cannot hope to win any race without adequate drifting (which in turn gives you nitrous boosts).  While mastering drifting is not hard for the average racing fan such as yours truly, the technique gets tiring quickly.  It's pretty much the same thing every time, and after a few races you'll probably come to dread cornering rather than enjoying the racing.So gameplay is problematic.  You may also take issues with the fact that none of the cars modelled in RR is a real car.  Instead they bear such silly names like Age, Absoluto, etc.  This is not surprising given that the kind of drifting advocated in RR is not real at all and there's absolutely no real-world physics involved.For a PS3 game, the graphics is terrible.  While frame rate is good, the tracks (which are probably rehashed from previous RR games, a common practice in the RR series) are surprisingly low-res.  This is apparently so when you compare RR's graphics with that of the Gran Turismo HD Concept demo, which is can be downloaded free from the PS3 store.  There are very few environmental effects, and the tracks feel way too generic and unexciting.I absolutely advise against paying the big bucks for this game.  If you want to relive the RR drift racing or what to give drifting a try, rent the title or find a demo.  In fact, you'll probably get more satisfaction from a PS2 version of the RR series since you'll be paying much less for the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2007"}

It is about the same size as the wii and about 1/3 the thickness.  It is so skinny and small I was so suprised when I first saw it.  I was expecting something as big as the normal PS2, just thinner but boy was I suprised.  I am not saying that is a bad thing either because I love how small and skinny it is.  Anyways, it works faster than the regular PS2 I think, it's quiter for sure.  I didn't get mine here on Amazon, but another place online.  If you can't justify spending the money for the PS3, get this.  The graphics are alot better than PS1, but not as good as PS3 because it's 1080p.  So if you got a normal sized TV just get this version of the PS2, and wait til the PS3 comes down in price.  The PS3 is nice because it connects wireless to the internet, but I just got this as a replacement for a dead dvd player and it works perfect plus I can play games on it.

I spent 60 dollars and was expecting a magnificent game, but it's not what I got. Yes, it is a lot of fun, but not much has changed from Arkham Asylum besides some gadgets and new navigation abilities. The 440 riddler stuff is all filler garbage content and is not much fun.. I have about 100 and have no desire to do more. The challenge maps are fun, but medal requirements for the combat ones are insane. Also, the story was Amazing in Arkham Asylum but in this game the story was even shorter, only about 8 hours, and it wasn't good until the last 3-4 hours. The side missions are mostly go here destroy this or investigate this. Only a few of them are great, my favorite being the Mad Hatter one. All in all, a solid game but definitely not worth 60 dollars. I sort of regret this purchase and wish I had rented it instead.7/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Dreamworks does it again!!","reviewText":"Once again Dreamworks Intereactive and Stevn Speilberg combine their knowledge of what gamers want and their knowleadge of WWII.

The short, fast paced gameplay was engaging and had me occupied for hours. However, this particular game just doesn't have the same feel and energy. All the single players range from boring to alright. None of them truly make me want to desperately come back for more like Nintendo land does. Instead I play through most of the games with the hope I will find good qualities, but often I come up empty. The multiplayer was ok. A few fun games gave plenty of laughs and enjoyment. Especially the pictionary style game, that allows players to draw an object on the gamepad and have the other player guess it.The best way to define this game is to call it a poor man's Nintendo land. The asking price clearly reflects that with it starting at $40 instead of $60. My best advice is to rent this game first.

I recalibrated them a few times before I realized that this was intentional. This game doesn't use the Wii remotes at all. It just uses your Wii U GamePad and your TV.Game and Wario is a collection of 16 mini-games, 4 of them multi-player, and 12 of them single player. It was originally created to be a demonstration of the Wii U's GamePad, much as Wii Sports was a demonstration of the Wii Remote's capabilities. But the story goes that the developers ended up designing so many of these games that they decided to release them as a stand-alone title.It's a shame that at least some of these didn't come pre-installed on the Wii U, as I think the slow sales of the Wii U are at least partially due to people being perplexed by the GamePad. Yes, there are a few hints of its potential in Nintendo Land, but Game and Wario really shows off the full potential of the GamePad.Here's a description of each of the games.Multi-player:1) FruitIn this game, a player on the GamePad chooses a random cartoon character who is the \"thief\" who has to steal some fruit scattered around the scene. He controls the player on the GamePad, trying to blend into a crowded scene of other cartoon characters milling about. 2-4 players watch the TV and try to pick out which character the thief is, based on clues such as the thief \"standing out a bit\" when stealing fruit and a camera focused on the general location of the thief every 30 seconds. It's certainly not as interactive or frenetic as Mario Chase on Nintendo Land; it's more a game of observation. I'd give this a 4 of 5.2) DiscoThis is an interesting game where two players each hold one end of the GamePad. Music will play, and one player will press buttons to the beat. The other player will have to match the buttons to the beat on his side. They'll then alternate turns. It's sort of an odd mix between Guitar Hero and the old game Simon.  I'd give it a 3 of 5, as the controls are kind of quirky.3) IslandsThis is a game where players take turns slingshotting these block-like creatures called \"Fronks\" from your GamePad (which you point towards the TV) onto a playing field on the TV. It's sort of like shuffleboard or curling in that you can knock other players' Fronks out of the way. Plus, the field itself will change depending on where the Fronks are lying. This one is very clever and a lot of fun in a group. 5 of 5.4) SketchThink Pictionary or Draw Something, where one player draws a word and 1-4 players try to guess it. It's a ton of fun with 3-5 total players, as you can compete with each other, the winner being the one with the highest total of correct guesses plus correctly-guessed drawings. If you're just two players, your scores are totalled and you can try to beat your high scores. It's cute how they display your drawings at the end in a slideshow. 5 of 5.Single Player:The single player games come with the first game unlocked, but you have to complete each game to unlock the next one. Spoiler Alert: if you want to discover each new game on your own vs. reading about them here, you can skip to the last paragraph of this review.Here's a description of each of the mini-games, as well as my own personal rating for each (YMMV, of course).1) ArrowIn this game, you hold the GamePad horizontally, pointing at the TV. You can draw back and arrow on the GamePad and shoot it onto the TV screen. It's similar to Takamura's Ninja Castle in Nintendo Land, except that you're drawing back and arrow to shoot it vs. swiping a nunchuk. An interesting twist is when a cannon shoots a cannonball at you, and you have to hold up the GamePad as a shield (and hear a clang as it hits). This was fun but became frustrating when the action started getting fast and the GamePad couldn't always stay aligned with the TV. 3 of 5.2) ShutterThink Jimmy Stewart in \"Rear Window\" for this one. You're given a set of \"suspects\" to take pictures of in a scene with three apartment buildings. You see the entire view of a scene on the TV, and you can use the GamePad to point and zoom in with the joystick, pressing a button to take a snapshot once you identify a suspect. Suspects may be walking around or closing their blinds, so you need to be quick. Bonus points for taking clear and close-up pictures. This one is ingenious and a lot of fun, and as you progress to other levels there are interesting new scenarios. 5 of 5.3) SkiIn this game, you're controlling a funky skiier out of the 70's complete with disco-style blue 'fro. You see an overhead view on the GamePad, while spectators can watch a first-person view on the TV. Your goal is to tilt the GamePad and guide him down the slope. It's not so much a skiing game as it is like those old handheld puzzle games with the marbles that you have to tilt to guide along a path. Still, it's a clever way to combine the GamePad with the TV. 3 of 5.4) PatchworkThis is literally a puzzle game where you'll have different patches of different shapes that you have to fit within a pattern that you have to pick out. Not as easy as it seems. Nice touch when you solve the puzzle and your puzzle turns into a cartoon object, such as a flower or a horse. 3 of 55) Kung FuHere's another game where you see an overhead view on the GamePad and a first-person view on the TV. Unlike Ski, here you'll be using both views as you play. Your object is to make it across to your master by jumping, collecting scrolls and life-sustaining dumplings on the way. This one takes a little getting used to, I personally was getting a litle dizzy going from one screen to the other. 4 of 5.6) GamerThis one had me laughing out loud. The premise is that you're a kid in bed playing with a Game Boy Advance-type handheld game. The games you play are a lot like the \"microgames\" found in WarioWare, ranging from picking a nose with the right timing to mashing the three correct buttons in a tiny fighting game. What makes this game \"meta\" is that all the while you have to watch for your mom, who pops her head in from the door, the window, and creepily, the TV, and hide your game and pretend to sleep as long as she's in the room. Some of the microgames are hilarious, and a lot will bring back memories. 5 of 5.7) DesignThis one is actually sort of educational. You're given tasks to \"draw a 2 inch line\", \"draw a circle with a 2.5 inch diamater\", \"draw a triangle with 1 inch sides\", and so on. Using the stylus, you do your best to estimate shapes and sizes. 5 of 5.8) AshleyAshley is a side-scroller where you control a little flying witch on a broom by tilting your GamePad up and down. You can view a closeup of her angle on the GamePad, but most of the time you'll be looking at the TV. Your goal is to collect as many coins as you can. 4 of 5.9) TaxiIn this game, you're taxi driver whose potential passengers are being stolen away by UFOs. Your job is to shoot the UFOs down with bazookas, pick up the passengers, and deliver them to a barn. At the end, you need to defeat a boss UFO who's threatening to take the whole barn away. In this game you see a driver's view on the GamePad, while you see a overhead map view on the TV. 5 of 5.10) PiratesThis is a strange game that's somewhat reminiscent of the old Rhythm Fever Heaven game. Wario the Pirate will direct his men to shoot suction cup arrows at you from ships to the left, right, center, or top. Your job is to listen to which ships Wario is directing, move your GamePad to catch the arrows as they fly into you, and shake the GamePad to drop the arrow; all to a beat. It's another clever bit of \"breaking the fourth wall\" as you can view the arrows coming at you on the TV, and then watch them plop against your GamePad.Once you finish these ten games, there'll be closing credits with all the characters you've seen throughout the games. And then, the characters all say, \"let's go bowling!\" 5 of 511) BowlingThat's right, bowling. In this case the bowling is much less sophisticated than Wii Sports; you use your GamePad to flick the bowling ball, and then tilt the GamePad to get the ball rolling in the right direction. Each of the characters you've encountered before are now printed onto matryoshka-like bowling pins. 3 of 5.12) BirdThis last game is an homage to both the Pyoro mini-game on WarioWare Inc: Mega Microgame$, as well as  the old Game & Watch handheld games. When looking at the GamePad screen, the gameplay is exactly the same as on an old Game & Watch, complete with LCD patterns, but on the TV screen you'll see a high-resolution version of Pyoro. It's a nice way to bridge the old and the new. Gameplay is simple, and sound effects are strangely soothing. 4 of 5.Overall, I enjoyed Game & Wario. Throughout the game is the wonderfully quirky sense of humor and campiness that only Nintendo can deliver. As with most mini-games from Nintendo, each one of these games is well-thought out and well-produced; some of the games are more fun than others, but unlike shovelware games there's not really a \"throwaway\" one in the bunch. Similarly the cut scenes and intros are beautifully illustrated and animated.In a way, Game and Wario highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses of the GamePad controller. On the one hand, I loved how the GamePad and the TV could display two different views of the same action. On the other hand, for some of the games I couldn't help but feel that the GamePad was not much more than a glorified DS. I would have liked to have seen more of the kind of multi-player action that we got a taste of with Nintendo Land (e.g., using Wii remotes) vs. the \"pass and play\" type multi-player experience here.This is one of those games I'd recommend not necessarily for extensive replay value (I'd say only 3 or 4 of the games are ones that I'd be excited about playing again), but just to be able to show off some of the possibilities with your Wii U's GamePad. Hopefully other developers will see some of the potential and come up with their own creative uses of the GamePad, and Nintendo will continue to push the innovation themselves.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004CVWETI","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A must own DS game for RPG fans!","reviewText":"Update (12/10/2011): So the difficulty takes a huge hike early on in Alternate History chapter four.  I'm really pleased with this, though I got destroyed very quickly because I wasn't expecting it.  And I'm well leveled.  There is a LOT more strategy required for the battles now.  So I'm more impressed overall.  I've been playing a few other games in the meantime (Solatorobo and Atelier Totori), but I've been taking a few swings at this over the last few weeks and will  complete the game then update the review further.  Just note: Much more difficult now, so disregard the earlier posted comments on how easy the game is.----------------------Update (10/12/2011): Well into the game and nearing the end of Chapter 3 (out of 6 I believe).  Finally we get to see some other characters to use in battle, and actually get a pool of several characters to choose from.  The story really gets into gear in chapter three.  Pretty gripping stuff.  The music has improved with access to new areas, there are several new scores instead of the usual 5 or 6 from the first couple of chapters.Also of note with the music, the regular battle music is rather... not intense?  It has a pretty good sound overall.  But when you hear the three or four boss music scores... those are a vast improvement.  And I like that they have several different boss music beats, that way the more intense and troublesome bosses have the more sinister music.  Nice!Another note:  There will be times in chapter 3 and on where it would be... inadvisable to do a timeline jump since there are not any nodes to bring you back to the current timeline.  This is nice because it keeps the story moving very well.  You 'can' do a jump, but then you would have to jump back much earlier in chapter three and re-work through much of that timeline to get to where you were.  Just saying that the developers seemed to say: \"Hey! Stick with this storyline a bit longer, it's just getting good!\"-----------------Update (10/5/11): Despite the game starting off ridiculously easy... it suddenly goes into extra tough overdrive about 4 or 5 hours in.  More than level grinding, what is required of later battles is a smart sense of tactics.  Many opponents will arrange themselves in the grid for a special attack, or hit certain points on the grid with enhancements, such as a MAJOR attack increase.  Your top priority at this point is to use your players to keep these opponents off those parts of the grid or to immediately knock them to a different point on the grid.Also, there are a few techniques you gain which enhance the exploration aspect.  You receive a technique to chop trees allowing you to access previously blocked chests/areas, and later you gain an ability to 'sense' hidden treasure and items on the exploration screen.  Give this game 4 to 6 hours and you really get into the meat.  It really doesn't even get going until the end of chapter one/ start of chapter 2.----------------Things that I enjoy?  First and most notable is the music.  The tunes are great old school RPG style songs with good variety.  They're catchy and mood fitting for the most part.  I also loved the included CD with the piano arrangements.  Awesome extra for those like me who pre-ordered (though there may be some with the CD still around).Graphics are amazing.  They remind me a bit of Xenogears from the PS1 without the ability to freely move the camera.  The sprites are chunky little 2d things but the use of character portraits helps to personify the main characters and overcome this.  If you really look around you can see the rich detail in almost every setting.Battles are fun and the use of the grid system really adds a bit of versatility. It seems this may have worked well as a Chrono Trigger like system with more are and line attacks and combos, but despite the seemingly simple system it works.  And you do gain better rewards after battle with higher combos.  I could sit here and describe the system and bore you to death, but better to check out an online video.The time travel element adds a nice touch to the game.  At certain points history diverges and there are nodes created to when you may return.  It makes some parts repetitive, but you can rapidly skip text in the blink of an eye, just not speed up character actions (like little clouds of annoyance or people walking about etc...) so some of the repeated points in history can get a tad annoying.The real gem of this game is the story.  You immediately dive into a complex and rewarding story.  Some of the other characters might get a bit annoying, but most villains and heroes are complex and rather a treat to engage with.  It is one of the deepest and most interesting stories for any DS game (the exact opposite of Final Fantasy Tactics A2!).If you enjoy deep stories, engaging characters, and fun battles then you ought to pick up a copy before they become hard to find and double in price.  This is a late release for the DS, but another of those classic style games that makes me a huge DS fan!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"A Milestone of Gaming!","reviewText":"Now here is a game that will define this generation of gaming for years to come.  Creepy environments, sadistic villains, crisp graphics, heart-pounding music, and tight controls all add to this fast-paced game that epitomizes the word \"ACTION!\"  I always wanted to play the other \"Resident Evil\" games, but just sucked at them because of their awkward controls and sort-of-dumb puzzles.  But this entry is one of the most user-friendly titles we'll ever get our hands on, and understands that gameplay is the heart of a great title.GRAPHICS---Yes, these graphics are simply stellar!  Fire has never looked so real, water effects are fantastic, and the character models look eerily like real people.  Also, some of these creatures and locations are unsettling with jaw-dropping detail.SOUND---The weapons will get your blood racing, as will the haunting moans and battle cries of your evil foes.  The music is very fitting.  I don't think it's as noticeable as some critics have praised the game's musical score to be, but that's because it blends perfectly within the game's context.  The voice-acting is just fine.  Leon Kennedy is perfectly cast, as the voice actor gives us a tough badass who spurts lines very few protagonists should even think of uttering.  The rest of the actors' are just fine.  Not forced dialogue or cheesy punchlines here.GAMEPLAY---The over-the-shoulder perspective couldn't be better.  Gun combat is tight and always exciting.  There is a mysterious merchant who shows up from time to time to let you sell some valuables and upgrade your weapons into effective pieces of hardware.  If you think about it, there isn't much variety in the gameplay, as you basically shoot enemies and collect items.  But hey, it's always great fun, and never wears thin.  The boss battles are original, but aren't too tough to figure out.  This is a game that throws you a little curveball, and gives you a loud cheer as you smack away a home run.  This game wants to test you, and yet gives you the urge to continue the dark adventure.  I do think the AI could be a little smarter about their collision with you.  For example, there were a couple of times that I could just freely run by the enemies in order to gun them down from one position.  But I suppose that if the AI were smarter than they are, the game wouldn't be beatable.  Lastly, there are two words that I want new gamers to look forward to as they play \"RE4\" for the first time...\"KNIFE FIGHTS!\"  You'll thank me later.STORY---Don't get me wrong...I love this game and enjoyed pretty much every minute of it!  But the story is not that great to me.  I mean, the President's daughter is kidnapped for what exactly?  They don't really explain that very well.  Ada Wong from \"RE2\" comes back, and inexplicably can perform outlandish acrobatics.  For that matter, so can Leon as he flips out of second-story windows.  I know this isn't supposed to be 100% realistic, but the physical reality that these characters inhabit can be a little too over-the-top sometimes.  Also, the ending Boss Battle is awesome, but it's followed by an okay escape sequence, and a lackluster ending.  This 16-hour adventure was not artificially lengthened, but has a mediocre payoff.  Still, don't worry about the Story too much, because the gameplay will bring you more than enough thrills!OVERALL---I love this game.  I think the Story isn't as good as critics and reviwers have claimed, but \"Resident Evil\" has always been more about the intensity and mood, not necessarily the plot.  Because the action gameplay is a breakthrough in the genre, and is complemented by superb visual and audio presentation, I cannot recommend this game enough.  \"Super Mario Bros\"...\"Final Fantasy VII\"...\"Metal Gear Solid\"...\"Grand Theft Auto III\"...you know what, go ahead and \"Resident Evil 4\" as one of those games that changed the standards to which greatness is acheived!  We're gonna be talking about this one for a long time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2006"}

The Konquest mode on this game is definitely the best out of the three we have seen so far (Deadly Alliance, Deception and Armageddon). You play Taven, a half god that has to complete a quest that he doesn't know about or Armageddon will destroy Earthrealm. Konquest mode was really well done and the story is addicting and very interesting. No longer do you have to learn tedious combos to progress through the game. That is a big plus.It is really great to see all of the characters on the arcade mode. There are a few flaws here that may make fans angry. One thing being that the individual fatalities are gone. Now it is just random button pushing that causes different things to happen (rip off arms, legs, heads and so on). Another problem is that when you beat the game, the end story is told only by a voice and the only thing you see is your character performing martial arts moves (katas) on top of the pyramid.So, overall, there are things on here that will make a lot of fans happy. There are also a lot of things that will make fans angry. I still say it is worth buying. Having all of those characters to choose from to play makes up for where the game lacks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2006"}

Never have I seen a design so dumb as a stop button which kicks you back to the XMB. SUre, for Netflix, it is pretty annoying but it doesn't take too long to reload and Netflix remembers the position of everything you watch. Blu-Rays do not for the most part so you will be in the middle of a movie, mean to hit the pause button and hit the stop button and suddenly you are back to the XMB. Not only do Blu-Rays not always remember where you are. Some have a bunch of non skippable previews and crap that you have to wade through to get back to where you were in the movie!! The odd thing is if you hit the circle key, you get an \"Are you sure you want to quit playback\" prompt. Guess what? You are never going to hit the tiny circle key by mistake. The big stop button? Yes you will hit it and hit it repeatedly. I recommend not having children in the room no matter what the rating is of the Blu-Ray you are seeing as you will find yourself cussing like a sailor at least three of four times per movie. ONe of the other reviewers suggested removing the stop button and I am a 100% believer in this. Grab a butter knife and pop the damn button before you pair it with your PS3!! You will thank me later. If you are worried about dust and dirt getting in the remote, a little piece of electrical tape will cover up the hole and not be too obtrusive looking. Once this is done, this remote is very good. The battery lasts FOREVER. It has buttons for all the controls on the dual shock and is pretty rugged and comfortable. My only other beef is mentioned by most people here. Touching ANY button on the remote will turn on the PS3. Make sure you place the remote somewhere where you won't hit it by mistake as you will have a PS3 that is always on. Not really an issue as I had a friend who left his PS3 on for like 2 and a half years...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Like a Vacation in a Game","reviewText":"\"Super Mario Sunshine\" is a fun game with some things that make it a big different from typical \"Mario\" games.  But, first, the story.  In this game, Mario and Princess Peach go to the sunny Isle Delfino for a vacation, but there's trouble.  A mysterious man that looks like Mario is making messes all over the island in the form of graffiti and this weird goo.  And the Shine Sprites are missing.  Mario is blamed for the trouble, due to being mistaken for the strange man, and is told the clean up the island.  (And you guessed it.  Peach is kidnapped again at some point.)Luckily, Mario has FLUDD.  This device can spray water, and so is great for cleaning up the island.  And not only that, but FLUDD has a hover nozzle, too, that helps Mario jump a lot better.  There are two other nozzles that you can get later, as well, though one of them doesn't usually seem to be very useful.  I absolutely love FLUDD.  I love the hover nozzle, which lets you control your jumps much better.  I've never been good at jumping with Mario, and FLUDD makes it so much easier and helps me to enjoy the game more.  It's nice not dying as much anymore because of slightly bad timing in jumps.The game is also quite fun, with a nice variety of things to do.  Each world has a good amount of Shine Sprites that you can get.  Eight are in different episodes.  Two are secret.  One is from 100 coins.  You get the Shine Sprites by doing different things, like collecting red coins, defeating bosses, climbing places.  Yoshi shows up a few times to help you in the game, as well.  Plus, the central location of Delfino Plaza has a good amount of Shine Sprites to find, as well.  And if you prefer to do a bit more traditional platforming, there are these levels where you must cross all these platforms without FLUDD, which can be quite difficult.  The game is actually quite challenging, which is usually nice, except when it's a bit too hard and frustrating, but nothing in the game is impossible if you try enough times.Something worth mentioning is that, as you likely can guess, all the levels in this game are island-themed.  A harbor.  A sandy beach.  An amusement park by the sea.  So there isn't as much variety in this game's levels as other \"Mario\" games, but at the same time, I really like the island levels.  It's pleasant.  It's like I get the vacation that Mario and Peach planned on.  The game also has very nice graphics and nice island-themed music.So overall, this game is a lot of fun, and I definitely recommend it.  It's different from other \"Mario\" games because of the goo cleaning and FLUDD and the purely island-themed levels, and I think they're nice changes.  And the game is a challenge, too, and will keep you busy for a while, which I also like.  The only problem I have is that I wasn't a fan of the story that much, but stories never have been that great in \"Mario\" games.  The important thing is that this game is fun, and it certainly is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B009B1D7JK","description":"The popular fantasy action franchise Monster Hunter is now one of the most iconic gaming series in the world selling over 21 million copies worldwide since the series began in 2004. Players take on the role of a hunter and are sent to explore a settlement within the Monster Hunter universe, completing quests on their journey to seek and slay monsters whilst improving their skills and earning equipment upgrades. With many challenging monsters and over 200 quests the latest edition to the series is set to be the most expansive offering to date. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate utilizes the functionalities of the Nintendo 3DS system to provide players with a truly intuitive hunting experience. The touch screen feature allows players to quickly access in-game books, weapons, field maps and mini games whilst the high quality graphics 3D visuals of Nintendo 3DS powered by the latest iteration of Capcom's MT Framework deliver a unique and stunning world for players to explore. Taking advantage of the portability of Nintendo 3DS, players can exchange their guild card that contains all their hunter's information with other players via StreetPass. Players can experience the world of Monster Hunter alone or in four player local play using Nintendo 3DS. Finding nearby hunters to adventure on quests with is now even easier via the local Nintendo 3DS search feature. Wii U players will be able to enjoy the hunt with Nintendo 3DS players via a local wireless connection. Gamers that own both a Wii U and Nintendo 3DS can take advantage of the inter compatibility of save data between the two consoles, taking the hunt from the living room wherever they go.","reviewerName":"Hunter Blake Lowery","summary":"Sharpen your skinning knife, it's time to go hunting.","reviewText":"I'll start by saying I'm a monster hunter fan, have been since the first ps2 game and I've followed every game in the series. (Even the Japanese only games) This game is, for the most part, a port of Monster Hunter Tri on Nintendo Wii. Every single feature from Tri is still intact. The game looks very good, honestly is sorta comes close to Tri on Wii. There are obviously downsized textures and some jaggies here and there, and I mean anti-aliasing not the monster ^_~Music is still all there, very epic feeling and all that jazz. The real meat here is the new monsters to hunt. This game is a mixing pot of monsters. There are over seventy monsters, from every entry in the series. Over 3000 pieces of gear, three new areas added, a new companion aside from Cha-Cha and over 300 quests, wow. It's easy to say if you're a monster hunter fan you should more than likely get this. It adds enough content to warrant a second run through and feels fresh despite being an updated version. The circle pad pro attachment isn't vital but is recommended, it makes the game feel like Tri on Wii. It plays just fine without it but it certainly improves upon the experience greatly, and considering the time you'll put towards this game it's best to get yourself as comfy as possible. Don't forget if you have a 3DS and the Wii-U version of 3 ultimate you can carry your save data over the two consoles so you can keep hunting wherever you are! A nice feature. The 3DS version does NOT have online multi-player, just local. I seriously have to ask why, it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to add.

I say this not as a casual, 15 minutes in a weekend gamer.  I say this as a gamer who, if absorbed and entertained enough, will spend a few hours of my weekend trying to get farther.I have been a fan of Squaresoft since I first rented Final Fantasy 3 when it was first released on SNES.  I then proceeded to enjoy Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore.  A few years later, I bought a Playstation and quickly acquired Final Fantasies 7 and 8 and Legend of Mana.  I also currently own Final Fantasies 9 and 10, and Final Fantasy Tactics.  These are simply a few of the great games I have bought, received as gifts, borrowed, and rented over my 16 years of life.When I first heard about Kingdom Hearts, my reaction was the same as many Squaresoft fans, \"Squaresoft and Disney!  What are they thinking?!\"  When I went to Amazon.com, however, to see what other gamers said about Kingdom Hearts, I found many people who shared my reaction, but had bought the game anyway, and all of them had given it five stars.  So I bought it.There are so many things that make this game what it is.  For one thing it has a fantastic storyline.  Although it took stories from about 10 Disney movies, the story line in Kingdom Hearts is quite original.  Most of the movie plots were changed to allow for disc space and for the story of the game as a whole.The voice acting is quite superb, especially the voices of Sora and the villain.  The game is made so that it can be enjoyed by all ages.  It has no \"mature themes,\" but is full of emotion.  The fighting is restricted to cartoon characters, and is not as violent as most other games of the genre now can be.  The action is enjoyable because it is always moving, action constantly continues unless there is a movie scene.I just recently completed the game on normal mode.  As soon as \"The End\" came on the screen, I went and started again on expert mode, which, when I complete it, will give me access to hidden extras.

Even when running on the Nintendo 64's very limited hardware, it captured the imagination and the hearts of gamers everywhere.  Now, this masterpiece has been given a facelift and very impressive 3D remastering for the Nintendo 3DS.  Suffice it to say that this is the first game for the 3DS that is worth buying a console over.The story, dungeons and game progression have remained unchanged for this release, so if you're a Zelda purist you'll be happy to know that everything in the original game is intact.  The difference is in the graphics quality.  It's clear that Nintendo went through some lengths to fulfill the original vision they had for the N64 version.  The result is a game that looks brand new.  I never played the original version, but playing through the 3DS version I honestly can't picture this ever being on the N64.  The faces look MUCH improved, the textures are more realistic and the colors are vibrant and eye-popping.  The 3D effect is jaw-dropping beautiful.  If possible, this game needs to be played with the 3D slider all the way up.  Particles gently float in and out of the screen, distance is really clearly discernable (especially running around Hyrule Field), and enemies freely pop in and out at you as well.  This is now the best use of 3D on this new console.  And since we now have a second screen to work with, the HUD has been completely removed from the main screen.  Your life bar, equipped weapons and items and the map are all on the lower touchscreen, leaving the 3D screen free to only display the glorious 3D graphics.  Switching items is as simply as touching them on the lower screen.  There are also optional motion controls available for looking around in first-person view, where you move the 3DS around to look at things.  If this is not your cup of tea, you can always revert to analog control from the settings menu.This remake is simply marvelous.  I knew Nintendo had spruced up the game, but I was very pleasantly surprised at just how vast an improvement it really is. While the game may still be a bit difficult for casual gamers (especially the mirrored Master Quest that unlocks upon finishing the main game), serious gamers who own a 3DS are doing themselves a disservice if they don't buy this game!

It was also known to be the first Zelda prequal in the Zelda series despite of the added features and variety of weapons and sword/shield upgrades compared to the NES series.  Who knew that a glove/mitt can make Link stronger, a pair of magic boots that can make Link run faster and break into doors and boulders, two different elemental wands that vary of weakness of the enemies, a hookshot to connect to out of reach areas/grab items/inflict more damage than a regular sword, three different elemental medallions that can damage enemies on the screens, and a magic sheild that can relect beams and block fireballs.

Adding on the the special features is a dark world/light world transition of which required you to obtain the magic mirror (to go back to the light world) and a magic pearl (to keep your identity and power ups in the dark world).  Now no other adventure game has ever done that.Despite of all the new features and complexed storyline, the game is fairly easier than the previous Zelda titles and alot more fun.  Your main goal (as Link) is to obtain the three triforces (this game combines the three triforces from the NES titles) which are the Triforces of Wisdom, Power, and Courage. Before you go anywhere near the triforces, you must obtain three different pendants (from three different dungeons guarded by the evil Gannon's guardians)to get the Master Sword.  You must use the Master Sword to get through the Hyrule Castle to find Princess Zelda and fight Agahnim (the evil Gannon's disguise). Then he transports you to the dark world (taking the Princess with him) as you rush through several altered creatures that would either help you or stand in your way, but you must make your choices wisely.  Then you find out that Agahnim has trapped Princess Zelda and six of the other King's madiens (daughters) in seven different dark world dugeons so its up to you to free the maidens from the dungeons by finding the seven different power crystals.  Freeing the madiens is far from your last stop because now you must use the power crystals and the power of the seven madiens to unlock Agahnim's dark world tower and fight him once again.  After defeating him, he turns into Gannon and now you must chase him into the pyramid for the final showdown (but not before you obtain the silver arrow, yes the silver arrow that will put him to rest for good).  Unlike the original Zelda game, fighting Gannon is far from a picnic so use better judgement with your strategies and make sure you have plenty of fairies bottled up in case you die in the \"line of duty.\"  After his defeat, you are awarded with the three Triforces of which eliminates the dark world and restores order within Hyrule.  Not sure how this will lead into the original Zelda, but who cares cause this game rocks!  I still have the game working order, but I had to order another Super NES because my 20 year old system has recently crashed.  This game proves to be the best of all the Zelda titles I've played (and one of the best selections from the Super NES library) only because of the cool graphics, enhanced features and gameplay, and also due to the fact that I can finish it in one day, even if it takes hours.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}

Soul Calibur was the game that convinced me that I had to get Sega's machine, I was not a Sega fan before then, as such when I learned that Soul Calibur 2 was in the works for the next generation consoles I was ecstatic. When I initially heard about it, it seemed that the Nintendo GameCube was getting the game, shortly afterward it was revealed that all three systems were getting their own version of the game, and that each one was being built from the ground up for that system, and that each one would have its own special guest star. I'll be honest, as far as graphics and sound goes the Xbox version takes the cake, not that the GameCube version or even the PS2 version are slouches though. All three look great, but the Xbox has the cleanest textures, and the highest polygon counts of the three. Namco did a great job utilizing the individual strengths of all three consoles. As usual the PS2 version doesn't quite hold up to the other 2, but it still looks great. So then it's a matter of controls. All three controls work great, but the PS2 version is the easiest and takes the least time to get used to. The GCN version takes the most getting used to, but once you've adjusted you can whip out powerful combos and one hit kills like no tomorrow. The Xbox s-type controller also works great, but the standard Xbox controller just doesn't work for this one as the buttons are too close together for me. So which one should you get? So many strengths and weaknesses of all three versions? Well that's up to you. All three versions are great. For me the deciding factor was that Link is in the GCN version and I think that playing as Link appealed more to me than playing as Spawn or Heihatchi. The GCN version is graphically superior to the PS 2 version, but not quite as sharp as the Xbox version. It runs in 480P Progressive Scan mode, and it looks great on my wide screen TV in wide screen mode. Only because of my character preference would I recommend the GCN version over the Xbox version, however. If you're a cross plat former the only reason to get the PS 2 version would be if you'd prefer the PS2 controller for this game, however the S-Type on Xbox will do just as well. I loved playing as Link though, so that's my recommendation, but whatever your preference, or system, get this game! Just don't expect it to have changed much from the original. In many ways I feel like I'm playing the exact same game. Sure there's a few new characters, but for the most part all the moves and game play mechanics are the same from the last game. Although it is still a blast, and a must have, it would have been nice to see noticeably new moves added, and more unique game play modes. Regardless it's still very worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2003"}

They decided to release the original three NES Super Mario Bros games onto a single SNES cartridge and update each game with 16-bit graphics and sound. Then, they went the extra mile to include a fourth game, the Japanese exclusive title,Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels, which was never released anywhere else. So it was a total of 4 games, updated for the SNES with a new battery back up save system that keeps your progress through all the games. Super Mario All Stars was released in 1993 and it sold millions of copies around the world.Leave it to Nintendo to show the other developers how to properly update classic games. Each game from top to bottom is updated in every single way possible: graphics (with added scenery and more detail), remixed music, enhanced sound effects, the ability to save anywhere and Mario now moves around and controls the way you saw him in Super Mario World. You can even customize the buttons to your liking in each game. Of course, adding The Lost Levels was an extra bonus because no one ever got to play it before.The bottom line is if you bought a SNES, then you need this game. If not, go get it....quickly. If you can't find it, then you could buy Super Mario All Stars Wii, which is EXACTLY Super Mario All Stars on a DVD disc that comes with an art booklet and a music CD.

Argh!  The game's pedigree and character design SCREAMS to this title being a spiritiual successor of sorts to Capcom's woefully abandoned IP.There are a few differences though.  Viewtiful Joe was a 2.5D brawler with more comic book genes than Super Sentai.  Wonderful 101 is a 3D brawler with a very unique weapon system and Super Sentai influences proudly worn on its sleeve.With that being said, the game is wholly unique to the gaming landscape.  Voice acting is top notch and the story is righteously goofy and fun.  The game is no slouch and very challenging, even at the very easy level.  As I touched on before, the weapon system is quite different in that you have to draw the weapons you'd like to equip via the Wii U gamepad.  Enemies are abundant and boss battles are quite epic in scope and encompass entire levels within each stage.  20 minute boss battles are the norm and not the exception but with that being said, they are FUN and not frustrating in length.Great game, I really hope it picks up some more steam.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

This is a good thing, since the original game was remarkably enjoyable and deep.  Of course, there are minor differences between this game and FFT or FFTA, but the core of the gameplay is identical.  You still command a small group of characters who can accept various jobs, each with its own (more or less) unique set of abilities, and combat other armies and monsters on a top-down grid of squares.However, the story in this game is seriously lacking.  While the original FFT had an engrossing (if poorly translated) plot, this game has virtually none at all.  Because the game is structured around quests, many of which are optional, there is no focus on the central plot line since you may very well take on multiple optional quests in between two \"main storyline\" quests.  The main storyline is also very forgettable, and I found some of the sidequest storylines more interesting than the main story.Nevertheless, if you approach this game with the expectation that you'll find classic FFT gameplay and a subpar story, you won't be disappointed.  There are lots of missions to complete for the thorough gamers out there, some of which are rather challenging, so if you stay interested throughout this entire game you can expect this game to last about a hundred hours or so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2008"}

Everyone loves it and then everyone hates it. What more can developers do to change the FPS genre to make it interesting? Better graphics? Better sounds? More realistic AI? Realistic physics? Less linear? Keep the linearity? More vehicles? Better story? The list goes on and on, and the answer is yes to all of the above.Bad Company 2 is a sequel of the first, but the first game was pretty forgettable. You play as a squad of four soldiers who were military rejects and must earn their freedom or face the slammer. They are sent into Africa and other parts of the world to find some sort of scalar weapon that the Russians found from Japan and are using it for global dominiation. Not something we haven't seen before, but the squad has great characters that you'll love and hearing their banter is enough to keep playing.A lot of people are comparing Bad Company 2 to Modern Warfare 2 and if I were to pick the better game? Bad Company 2 for single player and realism, and Modern Warfare 2 for multiplayer, but then again I'm not comparing the two so let's get down to it. The first thing you will notice is how real Bad Company 2 feels more so than any other shooter so far. The sounds are just amazing with the sound of fire echoing off caverns, the sounds of you reloading echoing in a building, the pinging of bullet shells hitting the floor, everything sounds like it would in life and is placed accordingly unlock most (if not all) shooters real or not. The foilage looks real and everything blows up. You can blow pretty much anything up in the game with anything you can get hold of. This is also used in game play when getting around turrets that you can't shoot through. Find some red barrells and blow the building up, then have it collapse on everyone below it. This goes for radio towers, telephone poles, and large trees. Then again it's pretty stupid when you can blow apart small objects like trash cans, chairs, or cardboard boxes, so its very strange.The weapon selection in the game is great, and you get all your real world guns and they fire like they should. The guns feel powerful, and everything about shooting feels dead on. Gone, however, is the whole healing thing and instead you just hide in cover to heal. Another element stripped is finding the gold bars, but instead M-COM stations that you blow up, and finding weapons. The M-COM stations are hard to find, and I don't know where all the hidden weapons could be, but they're there for people who like that stuff. I personally hate finding crap in shooters like this since it detracts from the experience and pulls you out. Other than that though the game is paced nicely and flows just right.There are some elements that haven't been down before like the whole blowing up everything in your path (in an FPS anyways) and there's even one level where you will freeze to death if you don't find shelter fast. This level has you knifing doors open as you race down a hillside. There some epic vehicle sections (that hasn't been done before), but there is one level that isn't linear that has three checkpoints and you can choose which ones you want to do first. The opening level is even from WWII in Japan so the game is full of surprises and is a blast to play.When it comes to multiplayer the game is solid with three modes of play, but my favorite is Rush. Like in the original game you have an attacker and defender side on a huge map (this one supports 64 players). You have five different classes to choose and you can customize them as you please. There are 3 \"perks\" that you can use at a time, but they must be unlocked and this takes awhile. The multiplayer is fast, intense, and fun with lots of vehicles zooming around, everything blowing up, and people just being crazy.My last words here must be how amazing the game looks. Probably being the best looking shooter around it looks great technically, but has no artistic style and is just \"real life\" type of stuff, so its not for everyone. If you want a really amazing shooter to play and are bored of Modern Warfare 2 pick up Bad Company 2 because its one hell of a ride.LIMITED EDITION: If you pick up the game anyone soon you can still get the limited edition that has 6 multiplayer unlocks and entitles you to upcoming maps for free. A deal? I'd say with it being the standard price and no additional charge. So find a new copy if you can","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I wasn't exactly sure what the \"3D\" meant, but I wanted a lot of features from the DSi, but wanted to wait for the latest generation. Wow am I happy I did!Look and feel: First off, the console is beautiful! So many people say that it looks like \"cheap plastic\", I am left to wonder if they have even seen one. My family has 4 DS Lites, and this console makes them look like poor cousins (which I guess now they are). The 3DS feels well made. Some DS Lites had loose hinges, but my new 3DS isn't like that at all. My personal DS Lite was the best of our 4, but the 3DS feels even better. My only complaint on the feel side is the placement of the D-pad. I know they wanted to fit in the slide-stick, but the D-pad it just a bit harder to reach. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time, but it is still a \"first look complaint.\"3D: Of course this is the major selling point, and boy does it not disappoint! Even traditional 3D accelerated games feel flat after playing Ridge Racer 3D or Pilot Wings. Even the included \"AR Games\" are beautiful to look at. They are fun, but really short. I am betting we'll be seeing more \"AR\" type games for sale for the 3DS in the near future.Graphics in general: I have seen some side-by-side comparisons on other review sites, but I was still wondering just how good the graphics would be. I have no idea how they did it, but the graphics really are as good as you've seen on the web. While Pilot Wings is cartoony, they graphics are detailed even from a distance. Ridge Racer 3D had my jaw hitting the floor.Battery life: Well, I've seen people say that their 3DS shuts off after 1.5 hours. I haven't had that happen yet. I just plugged it in after 2 hours of Ridge Racer 3D and it was still going strong. We'll have to see how it takes a real marathon session of playing, or a car trip, which I guess are really the same thing, eh? The included cradle is really nice, but it is optional. You can still plug in the 3DS and play, no problem at all.Included games: Included is one AR Game card, and a game called Face Raiders. Both are really fun for a short period of time. The AR Game \"Archery\" is a blast, I just wish it was a LOT longer. Fishing is interesting. I guess if you're into that kind of game, you'll probably get a bit of enjoyment out of that as well. The 5 \"character cards\" aren't what I was hoping though. I was hoping for an AR Game staring Samus or Link, instead all you get is a posable virtual action figure. Face Raiders will definitely have you and your kids giggling for a while though. Play it and you'll see why!Disappointment: I am really only disappointed in the fact that the touted online support is currently \"Coming in a Future Update\". I've heard of all the cool things that DSi customers can get and about retro titles being updated for the 3DS. So far, none of this is available. Hopefully they won't leave us waiting too long.Overall: I am very glad I waited to upgrade my DS Lite. While I may still keep it around for a bit while I make sure all the games are truly 100% compatible, it will be slowly phased out and the 3DS will become my main handheld. It's built better, looks better, and the new games that come out for it will really look amazing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

I'm a former flight sim fanatic (not so much now, due to the sad state of the genre), a current RPG fanatic, and I absolutely detest FPS games. This is largely due to the fact I get splattered whenever I join a deathmatch, but is also because these games generally lack even a remote semblance of a storyline and characterization.Having said that, and keeping in mind that I've also played the excellent X-Wing, TIE Fighter, X vs. TIE, X-Wing Alliance, Knights of the Old Republic, &c; (I could go on for quite a while with this) one must add extra weight to the fact that I really like Jedi Outcast. And yes, I am aware that it's a shooter. So the big question, of course, is why?First and foremost, this FPS actually has a plot and characters. Not only that, but it has GOOD plot and characters- so much so that they have actually been inducted into Star Wars canon.* This is an honor no other Star Wars game has yet been able to claim. In fact, the storyline is so good that you will hardly notice that you're not really seeing any new kinds of enemies (stormtroopers and other Imperial slime are still the general fare).The sound and look is superbly done. Voice acting is top notch, and instead of having full motion video cutscenes with horrible dubbing (as in the first Jedi Knight) they've used the game engine to fill in the blanks. And yes, it actually looks quite good- even compared to current games. Great attention to detail is a key factor in the presentation- when you walk into a cantina, you'll hear the familiar music from the Mos Eisley Cantina in Episode IV. The locations are varied and magnificent, with some taken from the movies (e.g. Cloud City on Bespin) and others from the expanded universe (e.g. Nar Shaddaa).Now, though I'm a lousy FPS player, I still know enough to say that the weapons are very cool. There's the standard rocket launcher, sniper rifle, close-range grease gun, and default pistol. All have very unique looks and effects, and strengths and weaknesses. Most have an alternate fire mode, which can add interesting functionality (e.g. laser tripwires on mines).And then, of course, we have the lightsaber and the Force. I cannot overstate how cool these are, and it's impossible to really describe it here. All I can say is that you've really got to play it, and that if you get good with both, two things will happen: you won't use your guns anymore, and you'll really feel like a Jedi master.The level design is excellent, with puzzles that make you feel smart when you figure them out, but also don't take a total genius to solve. As with the other Jedi Knight, there are secret areas that hold extra power-ups that can seriously aid in your cause. There's also many interesting objectives that require unique interaction with the environment. For example, you'll at one point have the chance to commandeer an AT-ST and run amok through the jungles of Yavin 4, blowing up stormtroopers as you go. How cool is that?Though I don't use multiplayer mode often (yes, I like this game, but I still get wasted in deathmatches) I have seen enough of it to say that it's comparable to any other FPS out there. There's no vehicles in multiplay, but who needs those when you have the Force? You can challenge others to one-on-one saber duels, play Star Wars-imbued variants of familiar games like capture the flag, and snipe honorlessly at passing Jedi from a balcony.Given its long, excellent campaign and flawless presentation, Jedi Outcast comes with the highest recommendation. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, its compelling story and great arsenal of weapons  will appeal to the FPS fanatic. Jedi Outcast is also one heck of a deal now, and still looks great despite its age. Go, and may the Force be with you!*Specifically, Kyle Katarn is universally recognized as the guy who stole the plans for the first Death Star.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2005"}

Boeshaar","summary":"A review from a truly disheartened CoD fan","reviewText":"This isn't a rant from a review \"bomber\" as the media is putting it, this is a review from a truly disheartened Call of Duty fan and PC gamer. Modern Warfare 3 is unbelievably disappointing for a franchise which used to be the leader in innovation for the FPS genre.Yes the graphics, menus, sound effects, and just about everything else are identical to Modern Warfare 2. I can forgive the game to a certain extent for the recycling, but what I cannot accept is how bad the map design, respawns, and matchmaking system is. The maps are smaller than ever, circular mazes of narrow alleys littered with random junk and enemies respawning behind you. 80% of your deaths will be someone who respawned and shot you in your back. Apparently Infinity Ward learned nothing from the failure of the matchmaking system in Modern Warfare 2 as the exact same system is back in full force, and that once again means you cannot kick the many hackers, cheaters, racists, and flamers you will inevitably meet, this of course not counting the fact that you will often experience lag in games where you will shoot half your clip only to see in the killcam that you were standing like an idiot and only managing to fire off 2 bullets.The inclusion of dedicated servers would have fixed 1/2 the issues of what is an \"okay\" game, but sadly it is not to be.

(by Laura)","reviewText":"I'm torn about this game.  For the most part, I don't really have fond memories of it but memories of frustration; which is quite unusual for me.  I've actually had this game since I was very young.  If a game is hard enough (it must be extremely difficult for me), I can get tired of playing it and put it down, as well as forget about it, for several years. Then, later in my life, I dig it back out to complete it (often my skills have improved since I last played).  So, in that respect, it occasionally takes me years to complete a game.  I'll give you the cons and the pros in that order.  Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not this game is even worth your time.Cons:1.  This game is one player only.  This isn't a problem to me, as a solo gamer; but I know many people like to play in groups or with a partner.  This especially hurts this game in fields relevant of today's; where almost everything is designed for the possible participation of at least four people.  I'm just warning you about this upfront.2.  No ending.  There is no ultra secret ending; it's all an over-hyped disgrace.  You have a door that requires at least one hundred power cells to open it.  You literally go from that you-know-what-hot-place and back to get one hundred of those stinking power cells only for a white light that the characters awe over.  You never even know what the white light belongs to!  Don't bother completing the game one hundred percent for something better either.  It doesn't work; that's all you get.  This made me so Hoover Dam mad!  They had absolutely no right to yank our chains like that.3.  Repetitious music.  Even upon hearing it for the first time in years, I'm sick of it.  It's okay at first; but even to begin with, the music could be better.4.  Various control quirks.  Jak looks horrible when he's jumping (like some deranged bird trying to fly) and his double jump doesn't even work if you wait even half of a second too long.  This leads to a lot of unnecessary deaths by falling.  Also, camera controls are just awful; it can get pretty difficult when your camera is determined to stay in one angle, when you need it to go into another.  This causes even more deaths by falling.5.  Hard and Frustrating.  Remember all of those deaths by falling I mentioned earlier?  You'll probably go through thousands of those as well as get lost a thousand times.  Have a stress ball or pillow ready, or you may break your game through your urge to thrash it.  Adding to this frustration, Daxter can occasionally be an annoyance (a cocky coward who's all talk).6.  Various glitches and somewhat poor level design.  This, combined with Jak's terrible jumping ability, can make this game a complete nightmare.  Look around online for more specifics on the glitches (thankfully, I don't think I've encountered many, if any) but trust me: they won't make your life easier.7.  Overused enemies.  You pound a lot of the same creatures, even over the course of different areas.Pros:1.  Beautiful graphics.  nice, lush backgrounds pertaining to forests, beaches, caves, and towns.  They use good graphics for lost cities, the citadel (which is like the final level), and labs too, but those can be a little repetitious.  If you take a few minutes to watch the sky in a natural environment, you can watch the cycles of day and night with the sun, stars, and moon.  Although it cycles slightly too quickly, I think that's the most impressive part of it.  Oh, bear in mind these graphics are slightly cartoonish.2.  Decent plot.  It's also very simple: Jak and his friend, Daxter, are exploring someplace the Green Sage told them not to go.  While they are exploring, they find a pool of dark eco, a sinister and black element harmful to all creatures.  After they find it, they are spotted by a villainous sentry which initiates a battle.  Jak fight while Daxter hides behind him; but the force of Jak knocking out the sentry causes Daxter to fall in the dark eco.  Daxter comes out, but soon realizes (and screams) over being transformed into a cute and furry little ottsel.  They return to the Green Sage, who scolds them for going where he told them not to go.  He's reluctant to help, eventually slipping the information that he can't help anyway: only the White Sage can help.  Now, how and where do you find him?  That's where the journey begins.3.  Comical/interesting characters.  Most of the characters are funny.  In the earlier stages of the game, Daxter will say something funny every time Jak passes out (gets defeated on land), even to the point of insinuating that Jak's breath smells.  Also early in the game, the Green Sage scolds and screams at them like crazy; which is also funny.  Sadly, at the later points of the game, these jokes go away making some of the characters seem serious and out of material (which isn't overwhelmingly) much).  That doesn't mean there aren't any more interesting characters: Kiera, for example, is a female inventor of sorts that will make various crafts for you.  You'll also bump into a sculptor looking for his muse and even a guy wearing a barrel.  The sculptor and barrel wearing guy, however, are characters that can only be spoken to a limited number of times.4.  The fishing minigame is fun.5.  It's addictive at first.Conclusion:That's all I can really say.  This game had the potential to be excellent, but it didn't quite hit the mark.  Those with a lot of patience will enjoy it the most.  Don't give it to younger children unless they're really skilled; or they won't enjoy it.  You can buy it if you want a real challenge (that has quirks), or if something here really appeals to you; but other than that, there are better platformers out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2008"}

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"N.

{"product_name":"B00D96BJSO","description":"","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Works, but cable is kind of awkward and drains controller batteries","reviewText":"I've got a very nice pair of Sennheiser headphones I use with my AV setup.  They replaced a wired set I used to use, and then a wireless Logitech set I used for a few years.  So when these came up in the Vine program, I was curious how they'd compare.As others have said, they're well packaged.  Easy to get everything out, and comes with pretty much everything you'd need.  I like the design of the base that plugs into the Xbox One controller.  It's unobtrusive, and very easy to use.  I also like that the MUTE button lights up when it's on, so you have a good visual reminder that your voice is cut off.I've got some friends who did some headphones, I don't know if they were these specifically or some other ones, and heard them complain about the update for the controller.  I'm not sure why, it was about as painless as it could possibly be.  When you plug the adapter into the controller, it pops up a message on screen that you need to update the controller.  It tells you to plug it in with a USB cable to the Xbox One.  Granted, in this day and age you'd think they'd be able to do it over the wireless, but maybe it's a time issue, and doing it that way would take too long compared to the bandwidth they can send over the USB.  But regardless, it was simple.  Plugged it in via USB, hit OK and it ran the update.  Took a minute or so.  It then asked if I wanted to do another.  I got the second Xbox One controller, didn't know if it would need the module plugged in first or not, so tried it without the headset module, just the USB, and it updated fine.  Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy as my 10 year old loves to say.The sounds are good.  Not epic, you won't be seeing any audiophiles using this as their main headset, but for gaming and watching TV or movies, it's certainly more than adequate.  Good volume, good balance between everything, but I wish it automatically stopped the main sound from going out through the amp.  That way at night when I'm doing something, if I forget to power down the amp, this would prevent me from waking up my son with loud explosions in a game at midnight.However, I found that the signal is easily blocked.  So if someone is sitting closer to the TV between you and the console, sound is choppy and drops often.  Even if I just sit with my legs crossed and my knee is in the way, sound drops constantly.  So in my setup, my great room has a couch about 15 to 18 feet from the TV, and the Xbox is under the TV with a direct line of sight to where I sit, and I need that direct line of sight for the sound to work well.  Anything between the controller and the console, and it's like listening to an old AM station as you're going under a bridge or something.It's alright having these powered by the controller, since I can just swap controllers out if the battery empties out, and I prefer that to dealing with charging the headphones like I do my Senheisers.  But ultimately I would've preferred a wireless solution since the cord is a bit awkward, especially since it comes out of the plug at the end at a right angle, so it' either exiting &#34;down&#34; where it can be annoying on your lap if you sit like I do in a recliner playing a game with the controller in your hands, resting on your lap, or it sticks up, where it then arches around and back down again anyway.  No matter what, you notice it's there.  The alternate cable for use with MP3 players and such is something that could be handy, but I really don't see this as a seriously used option, because between the weight of the headphones and the thickness / heft of the cable itself, these just don't seem like something I'd see a lot of people using for their phones / ipods / etc...  And right by your shoulder is the large plastic quick disconnect where the different cables plug into this, making it even less of a &#34;portable&#34; option.  But for just sitting around the house, they'd work well.Side note about the battery life, it does seem significantly less when using these.  I've been testing them at night while my 10 year old is sleeping, and the controllers die in a single (not long) session even when starting fully charged.As I noted, the sound is good for games, movies, and TV.  Despite the weight, they are comfortable for extended wear.  When I was testing things out I played about 6 hours straight of Tomb Raider on the Xbox One, and I didn't have any pressure points or uncomfortable moments with it on for and extended gaming session. Nor did my ears or side of my head get sweaty as I usually find on this kind of material (since I shave my head, headphones are right on skin, so usually that creates moisture).The controls work well, and I'm glad they have them on the adapter and not dangling somewhere on the cable like so many headsets have.  Compared to my Sennheiser wireless headphones, these are noticeably heavier.  But not uncomfortably so as I noted when doing some longer gaming sessions.I only had a problem once with the mic, where I had to power everything off and back on to get it to work.  They did a very good job with it, the boom is completely bendable in any position, so you can position it exactly how you want it to be.  And the base of the plug is shaped, so it can only plug in one way, which means that it won't pivot and twist on you without you explicitly moving it because the plug can't turn in place.All in all they do what they claim they will do, but for the price, unless they can do something to fix the &#34;line of sight needed or the sound is horrible&#34; problem, it's not worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2014"}

E Jackson","summary":"Mario in 3D- oh boy, it never gets better","reviewText":"I haven't played a new Mario game since Super Mario 64, and my experience with that game left me feeling like it was an unexceptional and overrated game, with the biggest complaint being there were simply WAY too many empty areas throughout the game resulting in too much pointless roaming around to do.  Lack of enemies severely hurt Super Mario 64.Well, more than 12 years later, I'm now playing Super Mario Galaxy that I received for Christmas... and uh oh.  The same exact problems I experienced with Super Mario 64 have returned, and in most likelihood, those problems probably never even left in the first place (so I'm definitely not kicking myself for ignoring every new Mario release over the last several years).  It appears like I didn't miss anything special about the Mario series at all the last 10 years.  Unless utter disappointment and frustration qualifies as special?  Didn't think so.The number one biggest complaint with Super Mario Galaxy is that it's VERY hard to control Mario's movements.  You think I'm terrible at video games?  Guess again- I've been playing video games for over 20 years and learned to deal with a variety of different movements, many of which were *really* downright confusing and discouraging (such as a fair share from the NES console for example) but nothing has EVER given me as much frustration as this game has.First of all, Mario doesn't move with *nearly* as much speed as he did in the older Mario games, and in fact, there's not even a run button.  Why is this?  I have no earthly idea.  When you take away the speed, you inadvertently take away the crucial element of \"fun\".  Simple as that.Furthermore, a lot of times the camera pans out so you can barely even SEE where Mario is going, or what Mario is even doing!  This results in a *lot* of unfair, cheap and untimely deaths.  It's ridiculous that I keep falling over the edge (and into that huge orange/black spinning black hole of instant death that constantly lurks below) simply because I can't see what Mario is doing.Oh, and no- it's NOT my television screen either.  It's perfectly fine.  My eyes are fine too.  The fact that Mario's movements are so slow and stiff also contributes to many unnecessary deaths.  This is NOT why I fell in love with the Mario series back when I had an NES and Super NES either.  Had Super Galaxy been my first exposure to the series, I would have thrown the game in the trash after giving it 5 solid hours of my precious time.I wish the movements were as precise and fluid as the ones found in the Spyro the Dragon series, specifically the *original* Spyro the Dragon series that appeared on the Playstation One console.  That particular series did 3D movements perfectly, not to mention it was a heck of a lot more fun running around collecting gems, completing mini games, interacting with many unique characters, and checking out more interesting/creative environments than the ones included here.Certain objectives later on in Super Mario Galaxy require *exact* movements in order to complete, and if you're off just a tad, you will fall to your death over and *over* again.  It's quite annoying, and to be completely honest -despite what people think- even the hardest of the old-school 2D Mario games such as Lost Levels and Yoshi's Island were significantly less frustrating than this.  At least I knew what I did wrong when I died in the older games, and learned from it next time.  There's no learning here- you either land safely or you don't.  Not much in the way of a learning curve.Oh, and those levels where you're positioned on top of a huge clear rolling ball and forced to use the Wii remote to steer it around correctly are, in my opinion, the biggest annoyance I've EVER had to deal with in a video game.Overall, do NOT buy this game for your kids-  Super Mario Galaxy was designed in a way that requires gaming skills of near perfection.  If you don't have the patience to perfect your skills, surprise surprise- this game will have you throwing your Wii remote/Nunchuk at the TV screen countless times.  That's a promise.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"nemesis","summary":"One of the best...","reviewText":"This game holds a spot very near and dear to my heart as being my favorite surrivival horror game (and I've played a lot of them), so instead of getting all mushy on you all, I'll mearly give you some of the basics. Let me stat by saying that many people believe this game represents one of the finest examples of story telling to have ever graced a video game and I will spoil none of it in my review. The game, in short, combines the creepiness and mood from the first game, with the controlls and graphics of the 3rd. From it's opening scenes, the game draws you in and however horrific and disturbing things get on screen (and at times, they will get very disturbing), the game mearly becomes more addictive. As things go on, you find your self intrigued, not only with the story of the protagonist, but with the history of the setting of the story, the town of Silent Hill (i'm not giving anything away here... the name of the game is silent hill 2, and if you can't make some sort of assumption that the game takes place in Silent Hill, you need not bother with this game at all). like many other survival horrors, this game has fixed camera angles (sort of... you can push a button to put the camera behind your player, but this only works in some areas) that can become a little bothersome at first, but in the end help add to the suspence. It also has corny diolauge, but this can be easilly forgiven, as it does not take away from the mood that the game creates. Next up, this game is not for every one and is not a gore filled splatter-fest, but does feature some blood and several disturbing images that will stay with you for some time to come. I recomend the game to mature players... not only because of it's content, but because of it's story. The game does not spell out any thing for you, and there is a lot of symbolisim (i.e. many things you see hapen arround you, reflect things that have happened in you characters past, or in his mind.... and you have to make this assumption all on your own in many cases, wondering what something symbolises) and the story touches on many &quot;mature&quot; issues, such as child abuse, wedding vows, euthanasia, suicide, hommicide, and religion. After all the praise I have given the game, you may be wondering why I rated the orrigional SH2 with only 3 stars. This is because the orrigional game is not nearly as good as the &quot;Greatest Hits' version for ps2 or the &quot;restless dreams&quot; version for x-box (both versions are exactly the same). These versions contain many things that were not included in the orrigional game, such as more endings, more items, more options, and a different playable character, and her own short story/prolouge that you can play through (lasts about 30 min.s to 2 hours, depending on your skill :-) ) Because of this, the &quot;greatest hits&quot; and &quot;restless dreams&quot; versions are 5 star games while the orrigional is only 3 when compared to them. Be sure that if you are buying the game for ps2, make sure the box art has a red top, with &quot;greatest hits&quot; writen in the red. If you own an x-box, the restless dreams version is the only one availabe for the x-box so don't worry. In conclusion, This is one of the best survival horror games ever released, and scares you in a subtle, creepy way that very few games can. Including an award-winning story, easy to learn controlls, good graphics (The graphics are saposed to look grainy.... after you beat the game once, you can make them smooth and turn off the grainy filter) and a healthy amout of replay value, this is one game that belongs in any survival horror fan's collection. .","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2004"}

{"product_name":"B004FUI84G","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A more structured and focused version of its predecessor","reviewText":"A lot of people compared the first Prototype with competing videogame Infamous, even though the similarities between the two games were minor. Prototype 2 on the other hand has a lot more in common with Infamous. In fact, this sequel manages to combine many of the qualities of Infamous with the first Prototype to create a game which is much more focused with regards to story, mission structure, and the acquisition of new powers when compared to its predecessor.  Taking place a year or so after the first game, Prototype 2 opens with New York City suffering a second outbreak of the Blacklight virus, now being referred to as the Mercer virus since it was supposedly Alex Mercer himself who caused this second outbreak. Sgt. James Heller arrives back home from active duty in Iraq and finds the city under siege from the infected monstrosities born from the virus, but even worse, his wife and daughter were killed as a result of the outbreak. Swearing vengeance on Alex Mercer, the one responsible for spreading the virus, Heller throws himself into battle and takes any and every opportunity to kill the infected so he can eventually find Mercer and make him pay. While on a search and destroy mission in the more heavily infected area of what is now known as New York Zero, Heller's transport is destroyed by Mercer himself. Heller then pursues Mercer through the destroyed city streets in a (obviously) futile attempt to exact his revenge. Mercer casually digs his Claws into Heller and infects him with a modified strain of the Blacklight virus.After being picked up by Blackwatch soldiers and Gentek scientists to be studied and then disposed of, Heller uses his new superhuman abilities to break out of the base. He is then intercepted by Mercer, who informs him that not all is as it seems and recruits him to his cause, which is to take out Blackwatch and Gentek once and for all. Now set loose to discover the truth for himself, Heller's journey will take him through three of New York Zero's islands that he eventually gains full access to as the main story progresses. The first island is designated the Yellow Zone, which is fully under the control of the military and has many refugee camps set up for all the citizens who have been uprooted from their homes due to the outbreak. The second island is the Green Zone, which also has a strong military presence and is the most well put together of the islands, with its citizens going about their daily lives as best they can. The infected occasionally make it through to these first two islands and will attack anyone they come into contact with. The final island, the Red Zone, is what used to be Manhattan Island and was where Alex Mercer had his adventure in the first game. The island has now been fully overrun with the infected monsters and even some of the buildings are on the verge of collapse due to all the fighting between the infected and the military. Other buildings have tendril-like infected tissue growing on them. It's like an episode of The Walking Dead on steroids.As far as the graphics go, this game does look better and overall more detailed than the first one, although there are significantly better looking games out there. The CGI cutscenes are an exception; they actually look pretty good. They're done in a style of black and white that mirrors what was done in the movie Sin City; only red objects (Heller's hood and infected tissue) and blue objects (computer terminals and the goggles on Blackwatch soldiers' masks) appear in full color. This wouldn't work for most games, but it does for this one. One thing the first Prototype lacked was drive. It's story was interesting, but didn't focus a whole lot on character development. Instead, it concentrated more on what was going on around Alex Mercer and the conspiracy he was trying to unravel about the virus and his past, making the whole experience feel somewhat hollow. This game goes the other way and focuses more on Heller and his interactions with the other characters he encounters, whether it's his old friend and ally Father Luis Guerra, the cold-hearted and dedicated Blackwatch commander Col. Rooks, or Heller's \"maker\" Alex Mercer. While Heller is no saint and will do whatever it takes to find out who is responsible for the death of his family, he is a more relatable protagonist than Mercer. Also, despite the fact he's a potty-mouth, he provides some genuinely amusing moments when he expresses strong desires to inflict harm on certain characters such as a Blackwatch soldier who calls him out and insults his wife, or another Blackwatch soldier who continuously (and annoyingly) refers to people as \"bra\".Ignore the other reviewers who say the story for Prototype 2 is rubbish: they're simply wrong. It's not the best story out there and some of what happens is kind of predictable, but there are plenty of interesting twists and turns that will surprise you if you're willing to make the effort to pay attention to the story. Well, before I lose those of you with short attention spans, I'll get to the juicy part of Prototype 2: the gameplay. I'll be the first to admit that this game starts out a bit slow and doesn't really pick up until a little bit before Heller reaches the Red Zone. Still, the missions Heller goes on can be quite fun and normally involve sabotaging Blackwatch's plans to weaponize the infection or destroying infected monsters. Most of the missions will have Heller consuming soldiers or scientists and copying their forms to sneak into their bases, destroying specific targets such as tanks, choppers, or monsters, hunting down human targets to consume them, and even accompanying Blackwatch soldiers on rescue missions through streets filled with infected. There are also plenty of side missions to complete and collectibles to... collect, and even these revolve around the game's story.The side missions involve Heller using his Hunting Sense which functions like a sonar and lets him track down specific targets. Finding these targets and consuming them lets Heller absorb their memories and gain access to vital information on Blackwatch's operations, making them vulnerable to Heller's sabotage. He goes about this normally by sneaking into military bases to mess things up, racing against time to steal important cargo scattered along rooftops, and the like. Other side missions focus on Heller going into underground Lairs which are breeding grounds for infected that must be destroyed, and other ones involve finding and killing small field teams made up of soldiers and scientists who are conducting experiments in different parts of the city; how you choose to dispose of them is limited only by your own imagination. You can throw a car at them, walk up to them and slice them to ribbons, divebomb them from hundreds of feet in the air, throw them into the ocean, whatever. These side missions, especially the earlier ones, can be somewhat repetitive, but nevertheless they're oh so satisfying. There are even audio recordings called Blackboxes hidden all over the city which are all found in the pockets of dead Blackwatch soldiers. Some of the recordings are interesting, but most just detail the soldiers' last words before being taken out by the infected. All these side missions serve purposes other than to increase playtime. Completing them earns Heller upgrades to all his powers and skills. The upgrade system for Heller's powers and abilities is more in-depth compared to Mercer's in the first game. After earning enough experience points, Heller will level up and be able to add a point to one of his main attributes which increase his overall performance: movement, health, regeneration, etc.Furthermore, completing a set number of side missions and acquiring enough collectibles allows Heller to gain other improvements to his offensive, defensive, and movement abilities. In stark contrast to Mercer gaining pretty much all of his powers by the first game's halfway point, Heller's rise to power is much more gradual (in fact, he doesn't even gain his first power, the Claws, until after the third or fourth main mission). He gains his main powers at specific moments in the game's story, while most of the corresponding upgrades can be acquired by completing the side missions or just killing enemies while in free-roam. It won't be until somewhere around the 75% completion mark that Heller will have pretty much all of his main powers available to him. He'll gain many of the previous game's offensive powers: Claws, Blade, Hammerfists, and Whipfist. Consuming certain infected enemies upgrades the effectiveness and damage output of Heller's offensive powers, as well as changing their appearances (spikes added to the Hammerfists and his Blade growing larger and sharper). There's also a brand new offensive power, Tendrils. This ability has Heller's hands turn into stubby appendages that can release tendrils from his fingers capable of ensnaring and damaging his enemies. The Tendrils can also burst forth in all directions from an ensnared enemy, attach to things around them such as cars and people, and fling them back into the center to crush the target enemy.All these offensive powers can be equipped from an improved weapon wheel which pauses the game completely and lets you map two powers at the same time to both the square and triangle buttons. For example, let's say you map the Claws to the square button and the Hammerfists to the triangle button. If attacking an enemy with the Claws using the square button is proving to be ineffective, then all you have to do is bash the triangle button to attack the enemy with the more effective Hammerfists. A handy system indeed. Heller also gains a new version of the Shield power, which he can activate simply by pressing the designated block button (R1). The Shield completely protects him from pretty much all forms of damage, whether it's infected monsters slashing at him or attack choppers firing missiles at him, although the trade-off is that he is unable to move when his Shields are up. Heller's own version of the Tendril Barrage Devastator lets him take out many surrounding enemies, and he'll even gain the ability to summon infected monsters to attack his enemies for him. And of course, consuming certain military enemies increases his effectiveness in using weapons like assault rifles, missile launchers, tanks, and attack choppers. He'll even be able to rip gatling guns and missile launchers off of tanks and choppers, allowing him to use them against other enemies. Finally, there are the enemies.A lot of the same enemies from the first Prototype make a return. Marines and Blackwatch soldiers with all their weapons and vehicles make a comeback, as do the Super Soldiers. Many of the previous infected enemies return as well: the weaker, zombie-like infected, nasty Brawlers (replacing the Hunters), and serpent-like Hydras. New infected enemies include obese and armored monstrosities called Juggernauts, the enormous and truly freakish Goliaths, and beings known as Evolved who possess abilities similar to Heller's. These enemies provide fun and challenging battles, but fortunately this game practically never reaches the same level of frustration achieved by certain missions and boss battles in the first game. As the game progresses however, the enemies tend to get easier as Heller continues to grow in power, with the only exception being the final boss (which was truly epic). All in all, Prototype 2 has all the same qualities that made the first Prototype so fun, only it has a level of polish and direction that was lacking in its predecessor. While even this game can be the slightest bit repetitive, it's still a blast and should not be missed by fans of the first game. Even those who didn't like the first Prototype should at least give Prototype 2 a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2012"}

I have a PS3, but I love my X360 and have been through 3/4 systems in its life cycle. I have a PS3 simply because of Naughty Dog games, MGS4, God of War, and the blu ray player at the time. I was going to go PS4 just because I own a vita as well and thought it would be cool to see how they work together but I am glad I went with my gut and got the Xbox One. This system yes is $100 more but once you start using it and learning its features you can see where Microsoft is heading and it is pretty cool! Games are awesome I pretty much got all the exclusives and BF4, and will be getting COD:Ghosts just because you have to own those titles to get the full online experience. This system is awesome once you give it a chance, and its only the beginning I can not wait until updates come in the future to see what else this system can do, not to mention all my family thinks this system is awesome and my cousin who went PS4 after spending 15 minutes with the Xbox One could not stop smiling, and he is a Sony Fan Boy!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Unconventional MMO and casual time waster","reviewText":"I've played a lot of MMOs.  I played and enjoyed Guild Wars 1.  Guild Wars 2 is very different to its predecessor.For me, the biggest depart GW2 makes from most conventional MMOs is that it has no quests to complete.  There is a single story, known as \"My Story\" and lots of public events in which to participate, so there is always something to do.  GW2 is a lot about exploring the world, and slipping in and out of those events that happen around you.  These events are not as dynamic as they first seem when you stumble on them by chance; they repeat quite regularly at the same locations.  The game does a good job at guiding me onto the next chapter of \"My Story\" so I always know where to go.  The cities and towns are alive with NPC characters that really add atmosphere to the world with their conversations and daily life.  It's quite easy to believe I am living in this world via my avatar, which I suppose is the point!Although GW2 has no monthly subscription rate, it does support an item shop and the purchase of gems (special in-game currency).  An annoying example of needing gems is if you loot a special chest in-game, then you will need 125 gems to buy a key to open it (800 gems costs $10 real money).  It's no wonder the in-game auction house is overflowing with these loot chests.  I understand that it's a player's choice to buy, or not to buy, gems and items from the item shop.  You don't have to buy gems to play the game, but it seems that if you want the 'cool stuff' then you will have to fork over some real cash.  I should mention that there is an option to trade in-game gold for gems too, but since coin is a real issue for me a lower levels, it will be a long long time before I can do this.I found the account setup process confusing (and I am not a newbie).  When I log into my newly created account, I found no place to add my game key, and no helpful links to tell me where to add it.  Instead, I had to search the FAQs to find out where to go to register it (at a completely different web address no less).  I am not sure why 'my account' does not contain all the information associated with 'my account.'  Very weird setup indeed.GW2 is pretty to look at.  The vistas are really nice backdrops while you're exploring.  There are some combat issues I have found, for example my ranger continues to auto-shoot even when a mob is dead, quite often targeting the next mob that I didn't want to engage.  And sometimes the character movement is not what you expect.  There are some teething problems that hopefully will be resolved in coming patches.  I like crafting, and I love that there is no resource node stealing ion GW2.  Whatever I see in the world is mine, even if someone beats me to the ore node or tree to chop.  I can still mine it or cut it down.Unfortunately, servers (worlds) are limited to the one you start on.  If you happen to be on a different server to your friends, you're out of luck since a move will cost you real money.Overall, I can't say GW2 will replace my current subscription MMO, but it is an interesting diversion and casual time waster for a few hours.  I give it 4-stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Not what I expected, but has potential.","reviewText":"It was hard for me to pin down what I didn't like about this game at first, then it hit me: I expected something different.  I'm a big fan of the Baldur's Gate series, and by extension: Icewind dale and Torment.  Neverwinter Nights really only has one thing in common with those games: they're based on D&D.;  After there the similarities pretty much end.After abandoning this game for the far less time consuming Warcraft 3, I've come back to it with a renewed interest.  Havign given it a second chance I must admit that while it's not the game I expected, it's still a pretty great game and can potentially have one of the biggest impacts on gaming ever.  Unfortunately, I still find a lot of my complaints to be valid.One of my biggest complaints in the single player game is the lack of henchmen.  One of the best things about the Black Isle games, especially Baldur's Gate 2, was how your Henchmen had minds of their own, would fight amongst each other, even kill each other.  I always thoght this was the feature that made the experience as close to a \"real\" RPG as possible.  In Neverwinter, you only get one Henchman, and there's little communication.  Since you can only make one player, you usually have to find a henchman that can pick locks or heal.  I've tried a lot of them with a couple of different characters, and they always seem to haev a high mortality rate.  I always seem to have to go back to the temple as they seem to die an awful lot.  In my opinion, they shoudl have limited the henchmen, but allowed extra henchmen for characters with a hgih charisma, that way the henchmen don't drive the story, or steal the show, but you at least haev a better tactical dynamic.One of my overall complaints is how tiny all the writing, inventory items, and maps are at a respectable resolution.  I find myself squinting at my 19\" monitor until it feels like my eyeballs are going to pop out.  \"Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind\" had this same problem.  Inventory management can get really tedious.  This is a pretty small complaint though.  I got over it quickly.The rest of the single player experience warms up slowly, but does eventually hook you.  I think most peopel give up early and make rash judgements of the game.  I know I was pretty disappointed at first that I wasn't playing one of those other games I loved so much.  This isn't Baldur's Gate 3 however and once I realized that, I kind of backed off and started enjoying myself.  The single player story really is pretty good, and the deeper you get into it the better it gets.  It does haev a relatively linear story, but you can stray really far from the tracks and there are side quets aplenty hidden around every corner.  I like the ability to zoom out for navigation, then zoom in for the action so I can watch the fight, which are entertaining thanks to some excellent character animation. The sound is also excellent and really adds to the overall tone of the game.  Of the three recent RPG releases that everyone's raving about, including Morrowind and Dungeon Seige, this is definitely the best single player game out there for hardcore gamers or even dungeon crawlers.The biggest reason to buy this game, and what will make it endure beyond the relatively flawed single player experience is one of the most ambitious editors ever made.  The community of wannabe game makers out there is respectable and growing bigger every day.  I've tooled around with the editor and must say it's oen of the easiest I've ever used for a RPG.  You can whip up a map in no time, opulate it with all manner of critters and NPC's, and then navigate through it with a charater to see how it works.  The scripting is where most people who've never had nay C++ experience, like me, will start running into some problems.  The scripting process is what keeps the editor from being completely user friendly.  If you haev a vision of a cool adventure that isn't a dungeon crawl, you're going to have to leqarn scripting.  I guess they couldn't come up with a wizard that was versatile enough to handle all the various jobs that scripting covers.It's the scripting that I think has made most of the player made dungeons on the net fairly mediocre.  People like me are still learning the process and perfecting what they want to get done.  Patient and thorough dungeon builders will find lots of helpful communities and forums on the net even if you can't find a really definitive set of instructions at this writing. The longer this game stays on the market, however, the better those player made levels get.  With patches, add-ons and a very enthusiastic community, I think this game is going to blossom into the experience we were promised.  If I didn't think that, I would have given up on this game a long time ago.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2002"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"CONTENT OVERLOAD?","reviewText":"Although I had high hopes for Dragon's Dogma, so far I've found the experience to be bittersweet. Here's why . . .STORY: 3/5Let's put it this way. There's DRAGON in the title, so right off the bat you know it's probably going to be a fantasy-cliche fest. In a nutshell, a dragon literally takes your heart and you tromp across the countryside to slay said dragon. Numerous and various \"pawns\" can help you on your quest.CHARACTERS: 3/5There are LOTS of characters in the unique form of pawns that you can recruit wherever you see a special stone. However, just like in chess, pawns are quite generic and more often than not end up as cannon fodder. The pawns come in a variety of sexes, shapes, sizes and classes, but don't have detailed back stories. You can customize one pawn in particular, the Robin to your Batman.GAMEPLAY: 3/5Here's what I mean by content overload: After a combat-heavy tutorial, you get to create your character. Thing is, there are TONS of ways you can alter the physical shape of your character. After a while one set of eyes looks like another and it's hard to tell noses apart. The positive side of this is that you could quite conceivably create any human-like character. My pawn was a mage named Bob Ross and he looked just like him as he painted his enemies in fire!So after trying to make up your mind with the many forms of character creation, one is further assaulted by the fact that there is no such thing as \"clearing\" an area. If you are like me and like to clear out entire areas 100% before moving on, I can tell you that you will probably be frustrated with this game. No sooner do you thrash one gabble of goblins than another one pops up. No sooner do you smash all crates in sight, only to see them fully intact at nightfall.As for the loot, despite the fact that you can't pick bodies ala SKYRIM, there is SO MUCH loot that you'll have twigs and berries and wolf pelts practically falling all out of your pockets! Unless you are absolutely nitpicky about what you want, you may very well find yourself picking up every glowing object in sight. For this reason, I wish the game had a LOOT SETTINGS, where only objects that pertain to what you want to use/combine will glow so that you can collect them. For example, if I'm strictly looking for items that will make a cool sword, what need do I have of being attracted to glowing objects that have nothing to do with that goal?As for the battles, they can certainly be a challenge, and on the positive side, I love how you can crawl all over the larger monsters in a way reminiscent of SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS. I also liked how the monsters move around and make a little more use of their environment. A good example of this is the Hydra battle early on, where the Hydra coils itself around a tower and crushes it before slithering on.Going back to the content overload premise, your pawns are surprisingly helpful in combat. Perhaps too helpful? I played for about 5 hours the first time as a mage when I realized that he was doing good if he could get one or two spells off before the end of the fight. Not a very exciting way to play, if you like to be the star of the show. I restarted again as a fighter with much better results but your pawns do seem to resemble buzzing bees as they swarm around you and blabber repetitive advice and hints.One thing I wish I knew before buying this game: If your idea of a fantasy RPG is YES! I leveled up! Let me allocate some points! Then you may be disappointed in this regard as well. Leveling up just makes your character stronger, but you do get frequent Discipline Points that you can use to learn a plethora of new skills.Towns and villages are pretty standard (inn, shops, NPCs, side quests). The world itself is mostly open--there are quite a few cliffs and impassable areas which mean that you pretty much have to go down a road until you can work around an obstacle.SOUND: 4/5I like the simulated rustle of ancient parchment and the scratch of a pen -- kinda makes you feel like you're playing a pen and paper tabletop RPG. The sound of your feet running over loose roof tiles also sounded unexpectedly satisfying.GRAPHICS: 4/5The graphics won't have you hankering to take screenshots left and right, but there is a wonderful amount of detail for each and every item you can equip on your character.Most impressive, is the fact that nighttime is actually NIGHT! Unless you have a lantern, you'd better hope you have the ears of an elf because wandering at night is usually asking for trouble.OVERALL: 3/5With a little more attention to story and characters, I think Dragon's Dogma could have been something really great. As it is, the amount of content and customization is both exciting and intimidating and without a strong story to carry it forward, I find it quite challenging to get excited about customizing characters involved in a quest that basically amounts to a shrug.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"I Teach Typing","summary":"Didn't Meet Expectations, But Not Bad","reviewText":"As the title of this review says, Watch_Dogs was what everyone was hoping would be a masterpiece of a game. While it isn't perfect, Watch_Dogs has a TON of content right out of the box, and while not all of it works, most of what it offers is excellent.Watch_Dogs stars Aiden Pearce, a hacker in the city of Chicago capable of tapping into the city's various pieces of technology, which range from hacking people's bank accounts to traffic lights and bridges. The story offered in the game is a tale of revenge and sadness as Aiden struggles to avenge a death in his family. While the story has a fair share of twists and turns and is unique enough to not feel cheesy, Aiden feels like a flat character (mostly because of the same gravely Dark Knight voice) and solves most of his problems through beating information out of people the player barely knows. The story is passable, but is mostly carried by its game play.Speaking of which, game play is excellent. Thanks to the game's excellent AI, Aiden can sneak past his enemies and deal with them quietly, or go ballistic with an arsenal of fun to use guns, or a mixture of both. Once unlocked, the player can utilize slow-mo bullet time as seen in Max Payne or GTA5.  This is a welcome addition to the game as it is incredibly useful when trying to pull off headshots on moving targets. However, game play is missing a few things. For one, why can't Aiden just randomly punch people? His arsenal contains various pistols, rifles, shotguns, and craftable hacks and explosives (which are super rewarding to use), yet he can't just give his enemies a knuckle sandwich. What's worse is the lack of the ability to shoot at enemies while driving. Instead, Aiden has use to his environment to deal with his rivals, but there are moments when just shooting out the tires of your enemies while driving would have been SO much easier. Side missions in Watch_Dogs include shootouts, infiltrating enemy strongholds (Metal Gear Solid style), but also fun gimmicks such as getting high (incredibly fun little mini games inspired by Saints Row), Chess, and Poker.Overall, Watch_Dogs has a ton of content for the price of admission. Buy it at a reduced price for sure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

Prince of Persia 2 - The Shadow and the Flame was bigger, better and the graphics were some of the best at that time. This was also the first time that a narrator that actually SPOKE was used in a game. I still remember my jaw drop when my speakers came to life, putting out more than just generic sound...In 1997 Prince of Persia 3D was released, an attempt to renew the series by introducing new elements like the third dimension. Let's face it, it wasn't the worst game of all times, but it wasn't really good either. After POP3D it seemed that the legacy had vanished. But (at least some) companies are smarter than actually dropping a promising brand only because there was one unsuccessful title. And so the Prince returned...Can a game actually be too good to be true? Having played hundreds and hundreds of different games over the years (no I'm not exaggerating, people often DO tell me to get a life though), there was only a handful that overwhelmed me so much that I just couldn't stop playing no matter how late the hour nor the work I should be doing. I heard good things about Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and from the screens and our preview I knew that I could like it, but after completing the game in less than 48 hours I knew that saying \"I liked the game\" would be an understatement. Ladies and gentlemen, dear readers - let me present you my personal console Game of the Year.Time is like an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I am, and why I say this; Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard...This time \"Prince\" ( it is an unwritten law of the series that you never actually learn his name) is actually of noble blood, not a nobody from a distant land that fought his way out of a dark palace dungeon and eventually conquered the heart of the local princess by means of defeating the evil Vizier that threatened her life and the future of her kingdom. \"Prince\" is the son of the king of Persia making him - can you guess it?Young \"Prince\" accompanies his father to pay a visit to the allied kingdom of Azad, but on their way they are also looking for fame and riches. And so, when the traitorous Vizier of India approaches them, offering that he will open the gates of the capital for them and allow them and their troops to loot the infamous treasure chambers of the Maharaja of India, they both quickly accept. \"Prince\", wanting to prove himself is one of the first to rush into the city's palace grounds. And here our adventure begins.The prince of graphicsThe graphical presentation is one of the best I have ever seen, and I admit that I'm not surprised that the developers stated more than once that this about as much as they can realize in the game, especially on the oldest console among the competition. But if this is the best, I have no problem with more similarly well looking titles coming this way.Sheer numbers are already a good way of expressing how detailed e.g. the animations and characters are. The prince himself consists of over 1800 polygons and over 750 different animations - way to go, as the original Prince of Persia had a character consisting out of 1 Polygon, with only 100 different animations.People that fear that - since we spend most of our playing time in a palace again - the levels can become repetitive can relax - the developers had more than one interesting idea. Various tracts of the palace feature different kinds of architecture, giant halls and libraries, baths and underground caves with gigantic waterfalls and stalactites to climb and stalagmites to impale yourself one, many outdoor levels including vast garden areas, a beastarium, and of course the inescapable visit to the dungeons of the palace. Not one place and not one room look the same, and you will never have the feeling that any of the level designers allowed their work to be sloppy.A symphony of athleticsFinding your way through the besieged city you will learn the basic and most of the advanced moves you are capable off. Besides running, jumping, climbing ladders and of course grapping ledges, our well trained prince is capable of many more things you shouldn't try at home.First of all he can run up walls. If the top of an obstacle is just out of reach, you can use this ability to gain some extra height and grab the ledge. While still running up the wall (let's call this action \"walling\" from now on - for obvious reasons) you may also decide to jump off the wall, possibly reaching prior unreachable places in mid-air of the now higher and wider jump.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"A GREAT fighter in the vein of the VS. series","reviewText":"For fans of all of the various VS. fighting games, DO NOT let this game fool you just because it is for the Wii. Tatsunoko Vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars was released for the Wii in 2010 to the surprise of all Wii gamers. That is because this title features prominent Japanimation characters pitted against famous Capcom Characters and the legal issues alone would have made it extremely difficult to release this outside of Japan. Somehow, Capcom has done it and not only did they add extra content not found in the original release but it came out at the original low price of $39.99 (typically, Wii games costs $50 and above.) For those who are on the fence as to whether to get this game or not, continue to read on.Tatsunoko Vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars is a fighting game that continues in the tradition of VS fighting games. You use two characters in a match up against two other characters at the same time for one round. Pick two characters, learn how to use their moves/grabs/throws, swap one and out of a match during the fight and combine their special moves into one mega move to defeat your enemies. Along the way, you earn points and \"Zen\" (the game's currency) and ultimately reach the game's boss to unlock the ending of the character you used to defeat him. Each character you select has his/ her own moves, special moves, endings and costumes to unlock. During the game, as you earn enough Zen, you can go to the shop and buy costumes, new stages, game art, new characters, and intro videos. The game keeps track of all the content you unlock, the number of times you completed the game, how often you use the characters and your general game stats that covers all the various modes (time attack, arcade, vs., survival and training.) You can even go online and compete against other players and have the option to add rival players to your list so you can play against later on. Lastly, this game supports multiple controller setups (Wii Remote and Nuncuk, Classic Controller (and Pro) versions and Gamecube controllers.) And even at that, you can customize the buttons on the controller that you use to your liking.The PROS: Like I said, do not let the fact that this was only released for the Wii deter you from thinking this game has bad graphics. It has GREAT graphics that match the fast, frantic pace of the game. You have 20 characters to choose from that span from Capcom games and Japanese comic books (plus 5 more characters to unlock and their appropriate stages and costumes as well.) All of the stages have their own unique theme and look and are taken from various Capcom games and change throughout the course of the fight. Animations, character stances, special visual effects just look great and do not slow down the game at all, no choppy graphics here. The music is awesome while the sound effects, taunts of characters and over the top game announcer keep the game sounding great and is typical of the sounds of the VS fighting series. No matter what controller you use, it's easy to control your characters and customizing your buttons is easy too. It's great to play against the computer and it's better when you invite a friend to play against you (there is 2 player support for arcade, vs. and training modes.) If you do something in particular, you can unlock an secret game mode (Extra Game) which leads you to a top down vertical shooter reminiscent of the classic Capcom titles 1942 and 1943. This mode supports up to 4 players and playing this mode also earns you Zen that you can use later on. Want to go online? It's easy to connect thorough the Wi-Fi connection to play against other people and from the few times I played online, I didn't wait long to connect with another player. And one more thing: this game is FUN!The CONS: Many people will look down on this title because it's a Wii game and it's been simplified. These people are used to the 6 button layout commonly used in the Marvel Vs., Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games and they are right in calling the controls for TVC: UAS simplified. That's because this game uses a 4 button setup (two punch buttons and two kick buttons) in addition to taunt, partner and mega crush buttons. It doesn't made an impact at all because it play and controls just like if you were playing those other fighting games as the rules and effects still apply. The controls are made easier when using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk but for those who prefer to pull off all the moves without any added help can easily use the Classic Controller or Gamecube controller. It's a minor fault that can be easily overlooked.In the end, Tatsunoko Vs Capcom: Ultimate All Stars is a great game and an excellent addition to anyone's game collection. From the graphics & sounds, wealth of game modes, unlockable content & online support, this game has it all for fans of fighting games and anyone from casual players to the veterans of the fighting genre can get into this game. I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Unleash the Dragon (3.5 Stars)","reviewText":"Blue Dragon is yet another highly anticipated XBOX360 title.  Not completely for hype, however, but more because of the men behind the game.  Hironobu Sakaguchi, Akira Toriyama and Nobuo Uematsu.  Sakaguchi is, of course, the famed created of the never-ending Final Fantasy series, Akira Toriyama is a famous character designer for the Dragon Quest series as well as Dragon Ball and Nobuo Uematsu is the music composer for the Final Fantasy games and a contributor to several other games.  The only man missing from this \"dream team\" is Yuji Horii, the producer for Dragon Quest.  The last time these men teamed up we got what is arguably one of the greatest RPGs of all time: Chrono Trigger.  So, of course, with a game like Chrono Trigger under your belt, as well as the Final Fantasy series, expectations for Blue Dragon are high.  Do they live up?  If you lower your expectations they do, but for the most part, this game is more of an introduction for those who aren't familiar with Japanese RPGs.You play as Shu, and as the game begins you fight a Land Shark, a monster that's been terrorizing the village of Talta.  Shu and his friends Kluke and Jiro have a plan to get rid of the Land Shark by leading him into a trap.  Not everything works out as perfectly planned however and before he knows it, Shu is waking up in some ruins alongside his friends.  This is where your journey ultimately begins.The reason it seems as though Blue Dragon is an introduction to Japanese RPGs is simple:  Everything about it is simple and basic, and there's really nothing too \"deep\" here.  When I say simple and basic, I'm not kidding.  The story is pretty basic.  Mostly because you just don't feel like it's going anywhere.  The characters don't help either and neither does the writing.  However, sometimes simplicity is key.  Because of how simple the game is, the learning curve isn't so steep here.  And while the story and characters are nothing special, the gameplay elements are.Akira Toriyama's work here is obvious.  The characters look like they were pulled straight out of Dragon Ball, the monsters look like they're pulled straight out of Dragon Quest.  The characters are obviously children, and a lot of the game is rather \"cute\" looking but the game is very beautiful looking.  The cutscenes are great, and some of the voice acting is pretty good (albeit at times annoying).Gameplay wise, Blue Dragon is like most of your traditional RPGs.  There are no random battles, just enemies out on the field that you battle upon making contact with them.  This means battling is largely optional.  There are, of course, times when monsters are in your way and you'll be forced to fight, but for the most part, there are no random encounters and that's a blessing.  In battle is rather simplistic.  It's a lot like battling in the NES installments of Final Fantasy and the Dragon Quest series.  It's entirely turn based.  This means that there's some time for strategy, and the game encourages it.  You know when your enemies are going to attack and you can plan accordingly.  Blue Dragon adds a little something to its field system though.  The Attack Circle.  Outside of battle you can make a circle to engage multiple groups of enemies at once.  This helps to clear out areas faster, but the real gem of this is to get two enemies that hate each other into battle and watch as they attack each other before they attack you.  In the long run, this really isn't something you'll do a lot.  Blue Dragon is by no means a hard game.A slight problem with the battle system however is framerate issues.  Turn based battles are usually slow as it is, but here you'll find they're even slower and it isn't because you have to spend time watching every action, it's because the framerate dips and the game lags.The abilities system is quite unique at least.  You select a job, learn the abilities in that class and once you learn abilities you can mix and match them all you want.  You can change jobs whenever you want as well.  It's a great and interesting system that allows for tons of customization.  It also a great way to provide some strategy in the long run.  This is because certain classes will have a direct effect on your stats.  For example, a sword master gets a large boost to his attack and defense.  Mages get a boost in magic abilities.  The system is very similar to the job system found in Final Fantasy VBlue Dragon isn't a bad sounding game, but Nobuo Uematsu has certainly done better.  For the most part, what you get in terms of music is actually pretty good, though you won't find yourself humming most of it any time soon.  As I said earlier, the voice acting isn't so bad, but there are some moments when it can be pretty annoying.Blue Dragon is by no means a bad game.  It's just a game that didn't reach as high as it could.  It sticks to simplicity and basics.  Basic storyline and basic characters.  Certainly that's not always a bad thing, but in this day and age, no RPG can survive on gameplay alone.  It needs a good story and good character development.  Both of these things, Blue Dragon lacks.Pros:+Some nice visuals+Simple gameplay elements+Battles encourage strategy+No Random Encounters+Job system allows for a lot of customization+Great cutscenes with some decent voice actingCons:-The story is not interesting-The characters are nothing special, either-The game is far too easy for veterans of the genre-Dips in frame rate in battle are annoying","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

I'm glad that Sony went back to the classic design of the 2 previous generations, but this doesn't mean the controller is perfect.The good thing about this classic design is that people are used to it, the controller is very responsive and the button layout makes it a great gaming experience. Analog stick positions at the center is better in my opinion if compared to the Xbox propose; Dpad also is great since the 4 arrows are not linked, which means that you won't input the wrong commands by mistake.Even though is a great controller, I feel that there are some minor improvements that could be made: first of all the L2/R2 triggers should be concave, this is definitely better for racing and shooters games; second point is that the controller is rather small, I mean, I don't want something as bulky as the Xbox, but PS3 controller seems small for grown-up's hands.

Then what is it? I'm not even sure. The races are pretty short and you start in the very last place, it's not a lot of time to pass the other cars. However, if you switch to manual transmission and learn how to control the car, getting first place on a stock car is not very hard in the first races. The hard part is keeping your hands from cramping. There are no button remapping options for the game, while you accelerate with R2, you've also got to shift up with R1. This is uncomfortable and takes away a bit of the enjoyment.The online mode pairs you up with one other person, it's really not that interesting or exciting, either. I don't even consider that a mode worth including or maybe they've included out of just including a mode that does online of some sort.

{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"Paul Hemenway","summary":"Just Flat Out Disapointing","reviewText":"I've been playing these Mario Party games since Mario Party 5 came out for the Gamecube, and I've been hooked ever since. I had so much anticipation built up for this game, but it turned out that I'll probably be trading this game in for something else after just buying it and playing a whole night of it with my friends.In past Mario Party games, there were all kinds of things that made playing the board aspect of the game enjoyable. Mario Party 8 fails in this area. The board is just flat out boring, and nothing really crazy happens as opposed to the previous Mario Party games. There are no spaces where rival players can take over and use them to take away your coins or stars or something like that.Duel games don't carry their same appeal as they did in previous games. I used to be terrified of them because there was more at stake. Now the highest stakes are losing about 20 coins or so. If you're a veteran Mario Party gamer like myself, you know this isn't a big deal, and hence forth, that aspect of the game is pretty much gone.The mini games aren't very fun either. Sure, there are lots of them. However, like previous reviewers have stated, they don't really take advantage of the Wii. Over half of the games require you to play your Wii remote like an average game pad. That was disappointing. The games where you actually use the Wii remote are just okay. I still think that Nintendo could have done a better job with these as well.There are a few new faces in the game, which is nice to see. Graphics are decent, but not impressive. Of course, you don't play these games for the graphics either. Plus, this game does feel like a Gamecube port, and feels a little rushed, too.I just think they could have done so much more with this game, and they didn't. After I was done playing this game with my buddies for about 4 hours straight, I felt just flat out disappointed. I've had way more fun with previous versions of Mario Party, and ask anyone who hasn't given this franchise a shot, you should probably give one of the earlier versions a try.

I didn't even know about this game because of the negative tag that comes with a movie/tv game tie-in, but the reviews about this game are spot on--it is just a lot of fun.  You can tell the developers were fans of the original series because they've captured the essence of the characters perfectly...Megatron is a megalomaniac, Starscream an insolent side-kick, Optimus the consummate leader, BumbleBee the brash little guy, etc.  And they've put these characters in a story that is actually well written and believable (in the Transformers world) that you don't mind watching the cutscenes.  I've read reviews that state the game is difficult and short on ammo; I would say it is not too difficult for any 3rd-person shooter veteran.  It's actually quite easy aside from some spots here and there.  Ammo and health pack are usually spread around where you have to find them off the beaten path.  The boss battles do require you to remember their patterns, but they are epic in scale and quite enjoyable.  The best part of the game, I think, is that you have to incorporate your ability to transform in order to get through it.  It's not just some tacked-on feature that you can do with or without.  So, how do you know if this game is for you?  Well, if you are a fan of the Gears of War series and the way it looks and feels, then you'll probably like this.  The only thing it's missing is headshots, blood, the lancer (although the melee in this game feels really powerful) and the cover system.

You have fourty bucks and want a few choices, so why not pick up this collection for the playstation 3 and since it comes with data transfer, you can transfer your saved games over and play them vita-side. For those of you who have played it before, you will be thinking &#34;oh yeah, THAT'S why I played this...&#34; in no time! And if you are new, either game has lots for you to do, from blitzball in Final Fantasy X to the all-too familliar card games in it's sequal, Final Fantasy X-2. You will hardly become bored...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2014"}
{"product_name":"B004RIACMW","description":"","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly not bad","reviewText":"Captain America: Super Soldier, is a simple and fun video game tie-in to the latest Marvel movie smash, and for what it's worth, it's a fun enough trip while it lasts.  Playing as the Star-Spangled Avenger, you mow down hordes of Hydra agents and other assorted baddies while making your way to take on the Red Skull, and that's pretty much the whole game in a nutshell.  There's nothing overly complicated and the gameplay does tend to get fairly boring after a while, but considering the fact that this is a very, very short game, this isn't as bad of a shortcoming as it should be.  The graphics are pretty decent, as are the controls and overall feel of the game, which is really quite a pleasant surprise considering how bad Sega's Marvel movie games have been over the past few years.  All in all, fan of the comic, movie, or both; Captain America: Super Soldier is worth checking out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"If you own a Vita, get this game","reviewText":"The mission: you must make friends, gather allies and stop the murders and the killer in this mystery-based and twist-filled story.Definitely the best Vita game so far. Persona 4 Golden is a JRPG with a good story line, lovable characters, and an addictive dungeon crawler.You play as a new transfer student who moves to a small town just before a killer starts murdering people. You discover you have the ability to enter TVs into a world filled with monsters, and that you can to call on your own monsters, aka Persona. Your Persona gets more powerful by forging bonds and relationships with the people in your new town.A slandered play through is probably about 60 hours. The dungeon crawler part will probably take up about a quarter of this time. You wander through the 8 rather large dungeons (plus a smaller one that could be counted as a ninth), opening chest for supplies  and fighting the monsters known as shadows. You do this for money, items and to get new Persona. The other way to get a new Persona is to fuse a few tougher  The battles are turn by turn but there are other elements to account for like building a good team, paying attention to the different weakness of the shadows and the occasional support you may get from the allies not currently in the party.When you are not dungeon crawling, you are in town. You need to boost stats like courage and intelligence to make and strengthen the bonds you make with people. This is the true experience in this game. The characters are voiced and dialogued  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard, but some also sounds a little phoned in. You must do all of this within a year of the game's calendar  which is when the main character leaves the town. You must also make a decision on how to spend your days and nights that are not guided by plot. This is one of the game's weakness  Since it is so big, and you have a limited amount of time to complete the game, you may often get the feeling that you are missing something.These characters and plots will make you laugh and cry because of the awesome voice acting.The graphics and gameplay will give away that this used to be a ps2 game but there are a few features made especially for the Vita. There is a new menu where you can listen to the music from the game, replay one of the fully animated cut scenes, learn about the psychology references in the game, watch old Persona series trailers, look at game art and play a quiz game. In game, there is also a feature witch lets you see what other people did if you need a suggestion on how to spend your day in the game.New players may have a little trouble getting started. Even though the tutorial is very long, it is not as specific and helpful as it should be, but by reading the manual and looking up tips online new players should be fine.Persona 4 is a triumph in the Vita's currently smallish game selection. Get this game.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Aaron Schug","summary":"Great System for Gaming and More!","reviewText":"I have been using this console since its release day. I always try to thoroughly test something like this for months before writing a review to be sure I have had enough time to play with most if not all of the features. This way I can take into account the changes (system updates) that have happened over time.Day One: The GoodThe graphics of this console are very good, even if some of the games are not running at native 1080p. Most people wouldn't notice the difference between 720p and 1080p unless they were side by side on a large screen. As developers figure out how to use the Xbox Ones infrastructure more effectively(especially the esram), games will look better with higher resolution and more reliable frame rates. Besides, if people really want the best graphics, build or buy a gaming PC. The user interface was clearly designed to work with Kinect. To me, it's a fresh change from the Xbox 360 dashboard once you learn how to navigate the system. The voice commands are very nice to have, allowing you to seamlessly navigate the OS with little effort. It is really nice to be able to snap TV or Netflix while playing a game, or to be able to go to the home screen while waiting for another online match to start. This way you can navigate through apps or check up on friends while waiting for the next match. You can do anything and then jump straight back to the game with no problems and continue playing. A huge thing for me is the elimination of a remote for the TV, the Xbox, surround sound system, etc. You can set your Xbox One to turn on all of these devices when the Xbox turns on which can be done by simply saying \"Xbox on\". You can also power everything off just as easily by saying \"Xbox off\", followed by saying \"yes\" so the system doesn't just shut down in case you change your mind. Another feature that I really like is the Xbox One Smart glass. It's an app you can get on any phone or tablet that allows you to control your Xbox through your mobile device.Day One: The Bad (nearly all issues addressed)On day one, this console had minor issues that were somewhat annoying but nothing I would consider a deal breaker. The most frustrating issue I had was the inability to party chat with friends for the first month that the console was out. The way we got around this was to Skype chat while in a private party. The reason we stayed in our own private parties was because if you didn't, people could still hear you in the game chat lobby and you could still hear them, defeating the purpose of having a private party. So, the only way to truly have a private party chat at first was to start a party with everyone you wanted to talk to knowing you couldn't turn party chat on, then inviting everyone to a Skype chat. Once party chat was finally fixed, there was still the issue of having to physically turn on party chat once you joined the party. Unlike the older Xbox 360 chat system which automatically turned party chat on when you joined or started a party. At first, there was no way to see controller battery life, or see how much space was used on the hard drive. Keep in mind that all of these problems are now fixed with the new updates, aside from Skype chat which still bleeds into game chat if you aren't in a private lobby. I really wish games were backwards compatible, but they aren't for PS4 or Xbox One.The Kinect:The Kinect is a little bit big but works much better than the old one. It can still look good at an entertainment system because it matches the Xbox One and has a modern look to it. The picture quality is improved to 1080p and it can see people better in smaller rooms compared to the Xbox 360's Kinect. This Kinect, unlike the Xbox 360 version, has no moving parts because of the better camera. When using Skype, the Kinect will know who you are versus other people. While walking around, the Kinect will track you as you move staying focused one you. If another person steps into view, it automatically widens the frame so that both people can be seen. The whole Xbox One system is very easy to use, especially while navigating with the Kinect. As for the worries about the NSA and other people spying on you, I personally would't worry. Most people now have some sort of device with a camera and/or a microphone of some kind including tablets, cell phones, laptops, etc. Many of these devices have voice activation integrated in them as well. So, if you think the Kinect is the only way to be spied on, you should probably make sure you don't have any of the items listed above. Either way, there is now an Xbox One sold without Kinect which will eliminate the issue.Voice Commands:The voice commands have worked for the most part since day one. Of course from time to time, things need to be repeated once or twice. I have noticed that as updates come out for the console, the voice commands become more refined and work better. I rarely have to repeat myself anymore. I would recommend looking up the voice commands so that there is no trouble navigating the system. The commands work great if you know how to use them. I would say that a majority of the problems people have are user error. Not stating the command properly, saying \"Xbox start party\" vs. \"Xbox go to party\" (Xbox go to party is the right command), can cause problems. I have also found that the commands work better if you pause briefly after saying \"Xbox\", then state the command. I don't know how the commands work for people with thick accents (non-American), but I have heard the system works well for these individuals too.Controller:I didn't think it was possible to have improved the controller much from the Xbox 360. I was certainly wrong. The new controllers are more responsive and have a much better feel to them. The button layouts have had minor position changes which to me, was for the best. You will really notice the difference between the two controllers if you play your Xbox One for a while, then try to go back to the Xbox 360. I couldn't believe how much heavier, less responsive, and less comfortable the old controllers are compared to the new ones. Another fantastic addition to this controller is the rumble feedback in the triggers themselves. It really pulls you into the game and brings a whole new dynamic to the way games \"feel\". The battery life is fantastic as well, I wound up buying a Nyko charge station for my controllers because of how convenient they are. They too have respectable battery life.The Box:The Xbox One itself is very esthetically pleasing in my opinion. Even though it is a more simple shape compared to the Xbox 360 or PS4, it looks very nice with the combinations of gloss and matte black finishes. It looks really nice if you have a modern looking entertainment system. I really like the way the Xbox One symbol looks while illuminated both the console the Kinect, and the controllers. Setting up this console is very easy, everything is labeled well and all of the cables fit snug when plugged in. One of the best parts about this console compared to the Xbox 360 and my gaming PC is how quiet it is. I can't hear this console at all while playing it, which is very pleasing. My gaming PC (easily twice the power of the Xbox One and PS4) is louder simply by being on, not to mention when the cards are working hard when playing games.Xbox Live:Xbox Live has always been incredibly reliable for me form the day I started using it 9 years ago (halo2). You pay $60 (often $44.99 on Amazon) for an entire year of multiplayer, updates, and very reliable security. Xbox live no longer requires a gold subscription to use free apps such as Netflix, TED Talks, Hulu Plus, HBO GO, etc.Overall:This is a wonderful system. It is amazing that consoles are capable of pushing the graphics they do while remaining quiet, cool (temperature wise), and affordable. I personally have a better social experience on consoles over PC gaming. I am happy with my Xbox One experience and am very excited for the future exclusive games! If you are trying to decide between and Xbox One and a PS4, I would recommend doing so research on what you would like to get out of the console. All that really matters is that YOU are happy with the your purchase. What lead me to Xbox One were some of the exclusives that I have always liked such as Halo, Gears of War, Forza, etc. Both systems offer a great experience with great games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"Sucks You Right In","reviewText":"Like many reviewers, I have been playing SC since the original. I played SC2 multiplayer for a good 6-8 months after its release (and the campaign of course) before feeling like I just couldn't get over my obstacle of getting out of Gold League. I stopped and didn't really get back into it. When HOTS came out, I shrugged it off now that I'm married, working full-time, and dedicate what gaming time I have now to stuff on my 360. Some of my best friends got back into SC2 and told me to pick up the expansion so we could all play. They said the new units were fun, lots of new maps, etc. I had some Amazon credit to get this for $10 and I figured why not. It's not like I have to be super competitive again. So towards the end of March I picked this up.Fast forward to now, four months later with 30+ hours into MP (still getting over my Gold hump) and just now scratching into the HOTS campaign. I am addicted all over again, and I love it. If you are an SC fan for the lore, this $40 investment (now $30 on Amazon for the time being) is a no-brainer. If you are still playing WoL multiplayer, you're missing out on the new units and an ever-growing e-sports scene. There's not too much to really persuade you on if you enjoyed WoL since there's a high chance you'd fit right in with HOTS.Some of the biggest changes including the new units have to do with Battle.net. Adding Spawning back in (meaning if someone does the free trial of SC2, which has limited options, or just WoL and they party with a friend who has HOTS, while in the party they will have access to everything HOTS MP as well. It's awesome!), improving the League algorithm for both Ranked and Unranked, and adding in more portraits and awards, like unit skins, make it all greater experience. Also I've heard in the rumor mill that Tourney modes and Clan support are a matter of time away.Of course a major component in the expansion is the campaign. If you hadn't guessed by the cover it is focused on Zerg. Like WoL and SC1 the story is no Titanic, but if you enjoy the lore you won't feel like you're wasting your time. I'm still going through the campaign, so I'll display how long it took me to complete once I do so.Stay tuned for updates as time goes, but seriously if you enjoyed WoL I'm not sure why you haven't bought HOTS yet, and if you are a newcomer who enjoys RTS's at least give WoL a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

They never seem to last very long before I've having to put a game on pause and go track some some fresh batteries, which sometimes sends me to the store if I don't have them on hand.  That problem is finally over now that I have the Afterglow Wired Controller!  Since it plugs into my Xbox via a USB port, there is no more fear that I might be about to run out of juice in my controller.The feel of this controller is slightly different than my original wireless controller, but the transition from holding one to the other isn't noticeable for long.  The sides are a little bit thicker on this wired controller, and the \"start\" and \"back\" buttons have been moved higher on this controller, but those are the only differences.  The size is the same as are all of the other original buttons.  The higher locations of the \"start\" and \"back\" buttons are distinctly different from when they were immediately next to the middle Xbox button, but although it was strange reaching for them the first few times, I now do it without thinking, like I did with them in their original place.One of the main draws to this controller apart from its lack of battery usage is its appearance.  Instead of being black or even some other opaque color, it's clear, allowing the user to see the circuitry within the controller.  I've always thought this was a cool feature when other controllers have had this as an option in the past.  It's really interesting to see how the rumble feature works and how everything fused together.In addition to the controller being clear, there are seven blue lights sprinkled throughout the controller that you can turn on if you wish.  I personally love them!  It's really fun to play at night in a dark room with the blue glow emitting from the controller.  Other reviewers said that the lights were too bright for them and would distract them from gameplay, but I don't find that at all.  The glow is just pretty to me, not distracting at all.  There is a small button located on the back of the controller that can turn the lights off, on, or only on when the controller rumbles.  Therefore, if you don't want to use the lights, you are never forced to.Overall, I think this is a fantastic option for an Xbox controller that doesn't require batteries, and it's much cheaper than the wireless version, as well as being about the same price (if not a few dollars cheaper) from the Microsoft brand wired controller.  The lights and appearance can also be a draw to this controller, but if it isn't your thing to have a blue glowing controller, you can simply enjoy the wired feature without ever having to look at the lights.  This is a high quality product that I am excited to be able to now use with my Xbox!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"This is one trip to Vegas you'll want to take!","reviewText":"I plan on adding to this review as I continue to play through the game, but first a disclaimer:  I've never played a Fallout game, nor am I really a \"shooter\" fan.  I saw my friend playing this game and liked what I saw, so I decided to give it a shot.The #1 thing I like about this game is the flexiability.  You want to just roam around the Wastelands or many other areas of the game, shooting Geckos and other beasts, looking for weapons, caps and the like?  You can!  Want to progress the storyline?  Check.  Want to just randomly pickpocket, shoot down and basically cause havoc, and have everyone trying to kill you?  You can do that too.  Reminds me of the GTA series, only with a LOT more depth, better graphics, and an overall more immersive experience.Dialogue is very meaningful and (short of cheating with an FAQ) encourages multiple replays to see how certain dialogues would play out that you might not be able to access (example:  Early on one of the option tasks, if you choose to help one of the NPC's, is to acquire dynamite to help with the fight.  If your one skill is below what is required, you can't get it (not that you need it but that's a different story).  That's just one minor example.This uses the same \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L\" system that Fallout 3 used, as well as different perks that you can use.  In the beginning, you get to set all these as well as create whatever character you want; there is a lot of depth in that editor.  Over the course of the game you can gain special boosts and the like which will help you meet the challenges at the end.Graphically this game looks awesome.  Any game that makes you feel like you're really there vs. just tacked on has hit the mark.Soundwise, this might be the most unimpressive part of the game.  If you listen to the radio station it starts to get old, real fast.  And absent that, the ambient sound and weak background music isn't going to get your blood pumping.  On the flip side, the weapons sound great and realistic.  Most of the characters I've met so far were well done as far as voice acting, and actually the mouth is with the words! (If you've seen this otherwise, you know what I mean...)This game controls very well, at least from my perspective.  You'll want to holster your weapon (hold down square) if you're just going from place to place, but be ready to make it active at a moment's notice.  If you don't do this you'll crawl from place to place (especially with a 2 handed weapon) and that will add to your aggravation.  The VATS system also returns from Fallout 3, and is awesome.  For a gamer like me that is horrible at shooters, it actually gives me a fighting chance to survive.Speaking of that, there are FIVE difficulty levels.  It's amazing more games don't get this right.  That opens up the accessiblity.  For the hardcore shooter fan there is the Hardcore mode which gives you a special trophy and forces you to REALLY monitor your healing/health/weapons or watch yourself die over and over again.  That's fine for them...I just want to play through the game and enjoy it without worrying about being 100% on.Replay value...one report I saw said it would take ONE HUNDRED HOURS to complete everything in the game.  The Hardcore mode.  3 different endings.  Countless places/quests to explore and do. If ever a game had a long shelf life, it's this one.Now, of course a review like this wouldn't be complete with the mention that it appears there are a TON of bugs in this game, however, I must be a lucky one because I haven't had one happen to me. (About the closest was I was talking to Sunny Smiles and her dog Cheyanne had her tongue sticking out, not breathing, not doing anything...LOL).  But be forewarned you could run into weapons disappearing from view, people floating, getting stuck in certain quests, etc.  They are working a patch to fix most of these issues, but just type in Fallout:New Vegas Bugs into Google and you'll see instantly what I mean.However, at the end of the day, this is a purchase I am VERY happy with so far.  Whether you've never played a Fallout game like me, or you're a Fallout veteran, New Vegas has an immersive story, tons of freedom, and is chock full of reply value.  You could certainly do a lot worse for $60 on the PS3 for sure.  Take the gamble and you'll be rewarded!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

I never post reviews before actually using a product first-hand. What urged me to post this warning was the unbelievable information confirmed these past weeks about the PC version of the game. And it was what made me cancel my PreOrder.At first we were told that there will be WEEKLY ONLINE AUTHENTICATIONS - FOREVER(!) The predictable outrage that followed included questions to the effect of: \"What does EA thinks they are selling? NASA's trajectory software?\". And they were justified; I recently bought ADOBE's CREATIVE SUIT 3 (a much more expensive software than a PC game mind you) and it required only an initial activation.What was to happen after an unavoidable format? What about if you were to find ourselves between internet providers for some days or your system crashed? There was no end to the ridiculous problems stemming from such a \"security scheme\". Were they kidding?Apparently they were...! The perpetual activation security scheme obviously was nothing more than vapporware and a PR attempt to make the LIMITED INSTALLATIONS issue more palatable - by generating artificial customer relief and all... (Nevertheless, re-authentication will still be required after every patch or update, including the automatic ones).YES, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! (We only get 3!) Well, we can all thank 2K GAMES & BIOSHOCK for introducing and opening THAT can of worms - but hasn't anyone at EA heard how hard BIOSHOCK's PC sales were hit by that disastrous decision? At what laughable lengths their Customer Community office had to go to explain such hostile measures to their own customers? History does indeed repeat itself as a farce...For the record, I have games (such as STARCRAFT, PLANESCAPE TORMENT & EMPEROR OF DUNE amongst others) that I have been replaying over and over these past decade. Would that have been possible it their Installations were limited to 3 (or 5)? Who on earth gave the idea that PC games are Kleenex tissues: use once (or thrice) and throw away?!And, let me guess: in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs!Since even excellent games get completely ruined by RIDICULOUS DRM schemes, a 2-star ratting is more than deserving.In the end it boils down to this: who actually will be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher - and potentially be pestered with the weekly need to prove our purchase FOREVER? And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course not! They did not work for BIOSHOCK, why should they start working now?One has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Chinese water torture? The Iron Maiden? Orwellian rat-masks? Guantanamo?NO THANKS! No RENT-A-GAME game is worthy of such harassment!I canceled my PreOrder some days ago. I will give EA the chance and wait to see whether they are willing to fix it. If this idiocy persists however, well, there are a lot of other games in the sea...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2008"}

This is a one-of-a-kind game","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visuals, astounding and gripping story, very immersive, sounds greatThe Bad: Some glitches, can be slow at times, not the game for everyone, some control issuesHeavy Rain really shows that a game's story is important because that's the main focus of Heavy Rain. The game play is simple, but the story is so deep and complex you'll never want to put the controller down. Before you start thinking this is some awesome shooter or something it's not. Fans of Indigo Prophecy will know exactly what this game is like. The story is a murder mystery about an Origami Killer who abducts children and drowns them in rain water (thus the title) and leaves strange traces such as orchids and origami figures. You play four characters throughout the story that are trying to find one father's son (Ethan Mars who is the main character that you play) as well as a FBI agent, a journalist, and a private investigator.The game starts out very slow and takes a couple of hours to really pick up. You start out with mundane tasks like getting dressed, brushing your teeth, fetching dishes, playing with your sons. All this is done through action commands that appear on-screen near items that you use the left analog stick for. Some actions require slow movement of the stick, some use the motion sensing, and some even have you holding buttons at the same time. The game is by no means an action game. It's all about story and you control every single action the four characters do.The beauty of Heavy Rain is the fact that you can change the fate of a character without even knowing it. Miss an evidence file when investigating a scene as Norman Jayden, and something could seriously go wrong towards the end of the story. Using his ARI glasses and glove you get to virtually scan evidence files and find them. If you miss one it could turn sour towards the end of the game, or in the middle, or the very next chapter, but it all depends on you.You always want to scan everything, use every action you see, and even read every thought you can. Reading the characters' thoughts can help give you clues in a pinch especially on timed events. Some events are timed and if you don't act fast and do the right thing it could change the whole story. There are even fight scenes where you have to press the correct buttons, and if you fail too much you can kill your character, and if the character dies they're dead through the whole story.The way the game changes is fascinating, every event even the tiniest one can change the fate of a character and this has never been done in this kind of detail. The game really forces you to think about your choices since there's no extra lives, and the fact that you can't redo anything is what makes the game so exhilarating. This feels like you're playing out a movie and you're the puppeteer, but never actually messing anything up or getting involved too much to make it feel fake.The game also looks astounding. This is some of the best facial animations, and skin textures ever in a game. The game looks truly real with some of the most high-tech next-gen graphics to date. You can see every poor on a characters' face, every hair is individualized and never a flat texture. The lighting is amazing and so are the physics. This is also a true game to behold and look at, plus the voice acting is top-notch Hollywood stuff.The game does have its issues though. The controls are a bit finicky when moving the character. You have a walk button and the camera shifts often so it changes the controls on you when it does. This can be a bit frustrating during time sensitive events. Even though the action commands really put you in the game it's not for everyone. It can be really slow at times, and some people just don't like this kind of game play. There are a few technical glitches such as texture pop-up and I had the game completely lock up my system at one point. Other than this the game is excellent, it just needs a bit better pacing.The game has multiple endings and finding out what would have happened if you did or didn't do something can be very inciting to go back through again. There are a ton of trophies to unlock and some nice bonus content. So if you love stories, and pretty graphics then pick up Heavy Rain otherwise stay away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMQOY","reviewerName":"Midway 47","summary":"Short but fun shooter","reviewText":"I don't play online so this review is based solely on the campaign.As I get older I find myself enjoying RPGs a lot more than strictly shooters so it takes a good game to make me want to spend my time just blasting enemies.  I found this game to be very fun, fast-paced, and easy to get used to.  At around a mere 6 hours, it's a short campaign but it feels a lot longer.  That's probably because I spent a decent amount of time upgrading my guns.  It's fun to explore the options and try out different weapons.  This one is much better than the original in every aspect.  I haven't played the Devil's Cartel yet but I hope it's as good.  The story is no award winner but it's still good enough for an action shooter.  Overall, if you like fast-paced shooters that take a little bit of strategy then you will probably like this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}

JAGELLA","summary":"Exemplary Shooter","reviewText":"If you've read any of my other reviews, you'd know that I'm an old fogey that pines for the good ol' days of first-person shooters.  I &quot;grew up&quot; on a fattening diet of Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, and Nitemare 3D.  Upon adolescence, I was playing games like Quake II and the ultimate PC game, Unreal.  Ever since my gaming childhood I've been looking for a way to relive those experiences with a more recent, technically advanced game.Aliens Versus Predator II fulfills many of my hopes.  It looks great and the developers obviously went out of their way to make good use of graphics cards.  Many parts of the game are dark, and you need to use special equipment or abilities to see in the dark and to see particular enemies.  For example, when you play as the predator you use a &quot;normal&quot; vision mode to see the details of the level you're on, a reddish vision mode to see aliens, and a bluish mode to see human marines.  Not only do these modes look cool but they also enhance game play.In addition to the predator, you also play as a marine or an alien.  You have lots of fun as either one, and, like the predator, you experience unique abilities and limitations as each character.  It all works very well, and all three characters you play let you see the same world and story from a unique perspective.  Very well done!Perhaps the best part of this game is the atmosphere.  It does a good job of making you feel that you're on a spooky alien world, and danger is never far away.  The AI is good, and it lends the impression that your enemies truly hate you.  The levels are well designed allowing you to interact in a rather realistic way.  Just be ready to be startled!  I jumped quite a few times playing this game.So why only four stars?  It's because of the bugs.  Most of the game is pretty stable, but I ran into a bug playing as the Marine in which I was unable to &quot;hack&quot; making it impossible to get some ammunition I needed.  In another level I was unable to open a hatch as a result of a bug.  Nevertheless, I got through these levels using cheat codes, so all was not lost.Aliens Versus Predator II is a really cool, well designed game that takes you away, so to speak.  It includes innovations that work very well and make the game fun to play.  If you're a shooter fan--especially a fan of the science-fiction themed shooters--then give this game a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2004"}

With over 250 of the baddest racing machines imaginable, an infinite number of ways to customize them, and all the tools you need to tune them to perfection, you'll find yourself behind the wheel of the slickest vehicles on the planet.With Forza Motorsport, you'll be able to own cars from the world's most recognized manufacturers. Get behind the wheel of the Enzo Ferrari, Porsche 911, Ford GT, or the Audi R8, to name a few. The physics model of each car is based upon actual car data, so your driving feels like the real deal. Plus, Forza has taken meticulous steps to design each car's visuals according to exact specifications. Teams of artists have worked to reproduce the surface properties of materials in an ultra-realistic fashion -- the painted metal is shiny with gloss, the glass reflects light, and the car's rubber is rich with texture.You can trick out every car with real-world body parts, such as rims, wings, side skirts, bumpers, and hoods. At the advanced paint shop you can pimp your ride with phatty decals and classy custom paint schemes. But don't stop with looks alone -- Forza also lets you upgrade your car with suspension kits, turbochargers, superchargers, intercoolers, brakes, and racing slicks.

Once you've built your vehicle and mastered all the driving nuances, you'll be ready to burn some serious rubber.","reviewerName":"Scott Sloan","summary":"Incredible Driving SImulation!!!!","reviewText":"I played the demo for Forza, and am sure like many i was not overly impressed with yet ANOTHER racing game.  We all know that Polyphony Gran Turismo series was the king of the simulators and all others were usually just warmed over leftovers.  Yes there have been some standouts but we always return to the series where it all started.  Now with Xbox's Forza Motorsports that reign that GT has held seems a little less clear then it did 6 months ago.Microsoft has raised the bar to an impressive level with this incredible game.  The arcade and career modes are rich, and challenging yet did not seem impossible to the casual gamer such as myself.  The car models seem well defined and each one handles a little bit different so you can fall in love with your first choice and then later on experiment with cars from different regions.  In Forza we get to finally race Ferraris and Porsches both of which are sadly missing from all of the GT series of games, and also we finally get to see these pristine rides bashed to hell by overzealous use of the accelerator, and forgetting what brake markers are really for.  Yes the damage engine for the game is wonderful, and also selectable which means yes you can have the damage OFF if you want to play nascar or you can click it to maximum SIMULATION and watch as your car developes an annoying list after knocking into a tire barrier.  Damage will effect everything on the car from handling, acceleration, and top speed so treat these babies like you really owned thm or else be doomed to remain in the cloud of dust at the rear of the pack.On-line play is where the game really shines, and takes on a life all its own.  Find the right \"room\" with the right kind of people, and you can easily waste a whole afternoon (or several) chasing your new found friends around the included tracks, which are all expertly rendered.  From New York, Laguna Seca, Rio, to the dreaded twists of Tokyo and beyond, Forza Motorsports gets my vote for Game of The Year!!!!  Rent it, Borrow it, or Buy it but if you are a racing fan you MUST try this game out, and see for yourself that there is life after Gran Turismo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2005"}

The game has a gyro-sensor and so you use no other controls except for the occasional but for an action.  You twist and turn your GBA/SP/DS to get it to do what you need, which is a multitude of mini games lasting no more than a few seconds long in length.WarioWare MegaGames set the industry on its ear when it came out several years ago.  By the way, when you finish Twisted, the original can still be found and is HIGHLY recommended.  The goal is to complete several \"mini\" games, from twisting your airplane to fly out between hanger doors.  To twisting so your legs match the syncro swimmers next to you.  But as you go the faster and faster you have to complete your mini game.I originally purchased the first WarioWare for my wife, we were looking at a long trip and she usually likes to take her GBA along to make the hours go buy.  This one is no different, except for she makes me take corners wide as not to affect the gyro sensor and throw her game off.

I do not like some of the changes made in Judgment but some of these 1 star reviews are a little overboard.Single Player - A let down after the epic well paced action packed campaign of 3. The entire campaign feels like Arcade mode every 5 mins you get a star rating and a new declassify mission. The problem is even arcade mode in part 3 was done better. The declassify missions are a great idea but basically are required to get the full three stars on any given mission. It really changes how I would normally play and wouldn't be bad if it was an occasional option but there is literally a new one ever 5 mins in the game. The story is lost with the new mission structure and Cole and Baird's characters barely say anything. There is no more funny banter between the characters. The new characters add nothing to the game and are generic foot soldiers. If you enjoy gears gameplay there is still fun to be had and the graphics are pretty awesome but the single player campaign overall is def a let down.Multi Player - This is where I spent the most time with Gears 3. I feel like the game spoiled me even without a season pass there was Beast, Horde, and many different competitive MP modes to play and lots of maps, King of the Hill being my fav. Judgment's MP offering is extremely bare bones. There are 4 modes Overrun which is Horde with other player controlling the Locust against class based COG players. This mode is pretty fun and would have been a great addition to what had been offered in Gears 3 instead it is the backbone of the entire MP offering and lacking just like the rest of the game. The main prob is there are only 4 maps in the mode that the devs showcased and touted before and after release of the game. I dont get it if this was the devs big addition to the series why short change it with 4 maps. I feel like they are basically forcing gamers to buy the season pass (annoying). Most matches basically play out the same way and with only four maps the mode doesn't have that lasting power.Survival mode which is supposed to replace Horde had big shoes to fill. Horde is basically the survival mode that all other games try to replicate. Well I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record here but this is also lacking. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS OVERRUN except you fight against AI controlled locust. Same 4 maps and objectives.So if I get sick of playing Overrun I can play Overrun again (survival) or two other modes Free for All and Domination. Which are as generic as it gets with online MP. Also those modes only have 4 maps between them.There have been some changes to MP gameplay as well I dont really want to dwell on them because they are basically just preference some I like others I dont. I really dont understand why FFA and Domination are COG vs. COG though doesn't make sense to me, It isn't a big deal and doesn't effect my score of the game I just think its a weird design choice.Overall I enjoy the Gears gameplay so I have had some fun with this game. I know the overall tone of my review is negative, but the game is a let down especially after how awesome I think Gears 3 is. If you are getting this for the campaign I would wait for a $24.99 price point. If you are planning on playing MP I would wait until the game and season pass purchase total is under $60. It seems like you have to buy the season pass to get the game that should have been available at launch.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

It wouldn't be too much exaggeration to say that it's a wonder of technology and engineering.  I have nothing but good things to say about this piece of hardware.  Sony packed a lot of capabilities in this little box. I understand that this is a review of the hardware itself.  And for that reason, I award it 5 stars.Now that the rating part of the review is out of the way, I would like to just make a comment on Sony's marketing of the system.  By system, I am not only talking about the PSP hardware itself, but also of the whole concept involved in the marketing of the unit, the games, and the restrictions imposed on the consumer.  Let's start with UMDs.  It's not hard to see why the UMD format movies didn't sell very well.  Basically, a consumer who wants to be able to view the same movie at home and on their PSP will be obligated to buy the same movie twice.  One in DVD and one in UMD.  It might have helped a little if Sony had introduced a home UMD player.  There are many people out there who would willingly trade a full-featured DVD for a UMD that can be viewed from television and the PSP.I've compared the cost of the Sony hardware with the Nintendo Hardware.  Sure, the Sony is more expensive.  But if the difference in cost is just a one-time sacrifice for the consumer, then it would not matter much.  Part of the problem is that the games for the PSP are more expensive.  Not only that, but accessories like batteries and chargers also cost more for the Sony.  Given all of that, the cost of ownership for the PSP will be noticeably higher.  A heavy gamer like me would hesitate, but not be completely deterred from getting the system.  I saved up for months in order to get the system that I want, to play the games that I specifically want.  But I suspect the majority of consumers out there are not like that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Plays great, looks great, sounds great... I dunno, I guess it's great","reviewText":"Bioshock Infinite is just about everything I've spent the last three years or so dreaming it would be. Many  of the more cynical folks out there seem to be annoyed by all of the glowing praise this game is getting. Personally, I can understand how this game could drive even a professional critic to embarrassing hyperbole. Bioshock was always in a 3-way tie with Dead Space and Assassin's Creed as my #1 favorite new franchise that started this console gen. The shoddy and bug-ridden AC3 late last year pretty much knocked it out of the running. I really enjoyed Dead Space 3 last month, in spite of some changes I didn't agree with. This game puts Bioshock way, way out in front. I definitely have a clear winner in mind now.What I *really* want to comment on is how much of a shame it is that last week's exclusive IGN review poisoned the waters for those who will play the console versions of this game. Their reviewer went out of his way to point out that the Xbox and PS3 versions are not as graphically impressive as the PC version (gee thanks for the news, Capt. Obvious) and he accused them of having \"sub-par lo-res textures, even for consoles\" or something along those lines. As soon as that review went up, the disappointment spread like wildfire. Gaming forums all across the internet were awash in the blood and tears of console owners who were devastated to hear that Bioshock Infinite was disappointingly not up to snuff.Well, I'm happy to tell you that, thankfully, it's a big load of b.s. As far as 360 games go, Bioshock Infinite looks absolutely fantastic. It compares with games like Gears of War Judgement and Halo 4 in virtually the same way that Bioshock 1 compared with Gears 1 and Halo 3. Like any 360 game, including Halo 4, if you go looking for blurry textures you will find them. Some textures are not meant to be viewed up close, jackass.Bottom line, this game is beautiful, even on the 360. If you haven't played the PC version, you should have no cause for disappointment. And y'know, even if the graphics did suck, the awesome game play would make up for it. This is way more of a robust shooter than either Bioshock 1 or 2 ever were. And don't get me started on the sound. I just bought a set of Astro A40 headphones w/ mixamp last week, and using them while playing this game is proof enough that they were worth every penny.I admit I did see one flaw in this game: They dropped the \"save anywhere\" system (which I always abused and will not apologize for that) and converted to a typical checkpoint/auto-save. In a lot of games, this wouldn't bother me at all. But in Bioshock, where you spend so much of your time roaming around huge areas scrounging for resources in every nook and cranny you can find, this is a big mistake. It really sucks when you get killed and have to back and re-scrounge everything you'd spent the last 10 minutes gathering. Also, I felt some mild disappointment when I realized that some of the cooler/weirder new game play features shown in demos back in 2010 and 2011 ended up on the cutting room floor. But all in all, this doesn't even put a dent in the overall quality. Nothing worth removing a star over.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2013"}

Judge","summary":"Terrible, Clumsy, Childish, Sexist (And I love zombie games)","reviewText":"I love zombie games and I am blown away at how bad this game this. Seriously. Before I begin, let me address the positive reviews that say \"Do not believe the negative reviews\": Nearly 1/3 of reviews of this game are extremely negative. We should not be ignored. The game is ridiculously bad on so many levels.It starts with an amazing concept that has infinite possibilities, except, it somehow makes it childish, clunky, and boring. I was promised an interactive sandbox. What I got was a world in which I can look, but can not touch. While Dead Rising offered a third person world where everything was a weapon, Dead Island offers a first person world where nearly nothing is a weapon and anything that is a weapon breaks strangely easily.The game opens by violently tearing the individual who tends to obey and respect the law from the game. None of the characters (that can be played as) are relate-able or even well developed, all of them are pretty much deserving of getting eaten by a zombie.The game just comes across as lazy: every single time you need energy, you have to chug one of the *many* energy drinks that can be found. For those of us that don't care for energy drinks, it makes one wonder, why can't we have other food be used as energy?  Why is it JUST energy drinks?  Is this laziness by the developers or is this supposed to be some sort of humor, playing on the \"energy\" in \"energy drink\"?The mechanics are simply clumsy. Aim for the zombies head and hit his leg...that is to say if you do not miss entirely. The missions given to you by the NPC are extremely tiring. Not because they are boring, but because I find no motivation in finding spark plugs for some guy who just opened his garage door and yelled \"hey you! I have a job for you!\"  And this is from someone who enjoys these types of video games (Dead Rising and State of Decay are two of my favorite games).Then there are the portions of the game that are just childish. In the first hour, it became glaringly obvious that every single female NPC was in a bikini and was extraordinarily proportioned. Every time that the main character is referenced, it is as \"he,\" even if you play as a female. There is even a bungalo where a dead gore-ified naked woman, tied down to the bed posts, with cameras surrounding her. I understand that many games tend to show females with sexist stereotypes, but this game does so in a glaringly obvious fashion that reeks of immaturity. The fact that one of the females is rough and tough body guard does not balance out the before mentioned.  Again, it really goes above and beyond just the examples I have given.It took me only two hours to become extremely bored of this game. I returned it immediately to my local GameStop, taking a $28 loss. This game is so bad that I would rather take an immediate $28 loss than have it all around my house. This game had so much potential, yet, what I got was a clumsy looking glass that showed me an immature, undeveloped world that I could look at, but barely touch, even if I wanted to.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2011"}

Sure the graphix are kinda low end because its on a Ds, but this game is well worth it! the gameplay is a little different, instead of going to worlds like in the original kingdom hearts, you are assigned missions, these missions take you to a section of a world and you do your task and then return to base. There is still exploring but its only a little bit at a time because certain ways are blocked off for later missions. SPOILER ALERT! The story line really got me! You start off as Roxas starting in the organisation XIII, since hs is a nobody he knows nothing about himself or why he is working for these people. after a while a new member joins the organisation, her name is xion and she is probibly my favorite character of all time! Roxas befriends Axel and Xion and they all get really close, but at the end it turns out Xion is a puppet, made by the organisation to take away roxas' ability to control the keyblade and put the power in her hands. at the same time she is taking memories from sora who is still in a deep sleep at the time. Although all of Xion's friendships and feelings for her friends are real, she still has to do the task she was made for. so at the end these two best friends have to fight eachother and xion dies.

The game came and gone, people...kind of liked it for it's content.  Crysis 2 comes out, does pretty well, multiplayer was introduced...I hated it.  Now this game, and the way it's structured, the game really does take itself more seriously.  It takes place in New York like the 2nd one, but now it's New York completely destroyed.  Grass growing everywhere, crumbling buildings and desolation...and lots and lots of Cell.As far as the campaign is concerned, I thought it was the right length, Crysis 2 was a bit on the long side but I couldn't really complain about it, I did enjoy that game's campaign.  This game is alot shorter, perhaps even shorter than the first game, but it's a wild ride.Multiplayer is in my opinion is weak, but stronger than 2.  A new gamemode and a reworking of the mechanics give it more depth, but for me it feels too much like it's trying to be Call of Duty.  Why do that, when it could be Halo?  Seeing that you have a billion dollar exoskeleton and not a cheap set of interceptor armor.I enjoyed the story and the campaign, and the controls, graphics, sound effects, voices, and mechanics are all very good.  Long gone are the more narrow environments of the 2nd game, and now a return to the larger Crysis 1 esque ones.  By now, this game should be super cheap, so if you're a fan of Crysis, or looking for a cool sci-fi game to get into, go no further than this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Truly a gret game but did Rockstar rush it too soon???","reviewText":"Sure you've heard of all the new eatures this game can bring so lets avoind all that and get down to some issues.  I am worried that Rockstar rushed this game to release too soon.  It seems that it has quite a few minor bugs that should have been worked out before shipping.  First off the new targeting system is worlds better than 3's blind set-up but still no 1st person ability to shoot unless you have a certain weapon.  Shooting is tedious at times as your character refuses to shoot.  I found this really only was an issue when using shotguns and a few other weapons and perhaps it is a problem with the preassure sensitive controllers but in the heat of a rampage with about 30 gang members around I found Tony standing there making funny hand gestures as I frantically pounded the O button but no shots would fire. (Yes I did have ammo and a fully loaded weapon.)  The camera is a little funny at times and could have used some work.  It is much more unstable than 3's was.  Walking through buildings is ver difficult as you can lose your bearings very easily as the camera spins frantically.  This cause you to run in circles or constantly run in the wrong direction.  Very annoying when running from the baddies.  Another quarky item is that of the boats.  The physics are much more sensitive than the last installment and I understand that piloting a boat in real life is tedious the boats found in Vice City are horrible.  They flip very easily and steering and finding your way around the obstacle courses is really quite frustrting.  I know I am a bad person for dwelling on the bad but all you have probably been reading are tons of reviews that just keep talking about the new features and cool things written by people who haven't even played it yet.  These are some issues that bothered me since it seems as though Rockstar was hurried to get this game out without refineing the controls to handle all the new goodness you'll find. Don't get me wrong this game is great.  In my opinion it blows 3 out of the water and I have only played maybe a quarter of it.  Definately pick this game up but just be preparred to find some minor control issues which hopefully will be refined in Rockstars next installment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8J1","reviewerName":"Craig Juan","summary":"The sequel to the best 2D fighter is on PlayStation 2 !","reviewText":"Originally entitled, Capcom VS SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001 in Japan. Capcom VS SNK for the Dreamcast, was no doubt, the best among the VS series and gamers agree that this was the best 2D fighting game that should not be passed up. It has pleased both Capcom fans and SNK fans altogther but some SNK fans complained about how they changed the characters, but most SNK fans really liked how Capcom enhanced their favorite SNK heroes with beatifully rendered anime style animation. Now two years have passed and the freshly made sequel, Capcom VS SNK 2: Mark of the Millenium was announced and it was said to be better than the prequel of the game...only this time, it was going to release for the PlayStation 2 as one of the first 2D fighters for the console, along with Sammy Entertainment's Guilty Gear X, in the U.S. since the Dreamcast is going out of business. But I didn't complain, since there was still some hope for me. I found that the DC version was available in Japan and I ordered it off of a store where they sell Japanese import games for all kinds of platforms. Currently, I own the game as a Japanese import for the Dreamcast, and it played very well. I also played the PS2 version as well at a nearby videogame store. I've expected the PS2 to surpass the 2D animation of the Dreamcast's superior 2D fighters, but unfortunately it didn't. Like Marvel VS Capcom 2 for the DC, the graphics are amazing and the backgrounds are fully detailed in gorgeous 3D technology. But nothing compared to Marvel VS Capcom 2 or the imported DC version of Capcom VS SNK 2. The 2D animation was way too pixelated. If you're not familiar with what I'm saying, let me sum it up for you. The characters look kinda bumpy. I have known the PS2 for its gracefully enhanced technology in gaming, but this...I was very disappointed with what I saw. It seems like the PS2 is not good at making good looking 2D fighters. That's why I've taken one star down. It would've made 5 stars if it hadn't been for the horrible 2D animated characters. The gameplay still remained solid and it plays the same as its prequel, which is a good thing. The contols remain simple and sometimes hard to master. Once again, the gameplay still combines the best of Capcom and SNK's spectacular playability. Some 2D haters may call it another joke, but this is still, one the best ideas in Capcom 2D fighting in years. The Sound is fantastic and it sounds way better than the first. Unlike Marvel VS Capcom 2, which suffered from horrible, unfit Jazz music, the tracks are very cool to listen to all day. The genres include hip hop, guitar, and orchestral music (the rap theme on the New York stage sounds cool and the appearance of Akuma and Rugal sounds like you're watching a movie). And the voice acting is great. Although there are some changes, there are no problems whatsoever. The cast of characters are an amazing surprise to the fans of SNK and Capcom. Your tears will shed as you see new warriors step into the ring like Rock Howard, the son of Geese Howard (You will see him in Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves on Dreamcast), Hyo Imawano's younger brother, Kyosuke Kagami from Rival Schools and Project Justice, Kasumi's father, Mr. Todo from Art of Fighting fame, The Joke Street Fighter Dan Hibiki, The strongest kickboxer from Thailand, Joe Higashi from the Fatal Fury series, Athena Asamiya from the KOF series, Yun and Yang from Street Fighter III (Yang is a secret character), Hibiki Takane from Last Blade 2, and more ! You will be thoroghly amazed when you see the new bosses of the game like Shin Akuma and God Rugal. Plus some unique features to unlock. Rather than just buying characters, colors, stages, and features by using a short amount of VS points, you can just earn them by simply playng through the game. And plus, its much more easier to earn groove points during battle, depending on which character your using. All in all, Capcom VS SNK 2 for the PS2 is a great 2D fighter, but it could've been more exciting if the 2D animation weren't so bumpy and pixelated. Still, this is even better than the original and belive me. Once you own this game, you'll feel very proud of owning it ! Still, if you want to experience the perfect Capcom VS SNK 2, do what I do and order the Japanese version for the Dreamcast. This version is the same as the PS2 version, only with better character animation. But still, both versions are very impressive. If you loved Capcom VS SNK for the Dreamcast, there is no reason why you should ignore Capcom VS SNK 2: Mark of the Millenium 2001 for the PS2. Respect it by buying it !","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2001"}

If you have not played the first ones start there before picking up this title. The action and 'fear factor' that everyone says is missing probably were playing with other people and having loud music in the background. next time try playing with the lights low and with headphones. On to the review:Graphics are not the best but not the worse either.sound and music are what sets the stage for any FEAR game. if you hear crteppy music something bad is about to happen but that is to be expected when you have hollywood directors helping out a video game.Storyline is about wrapping up ALL of the previous titles in one fast and albeit loose fashion assuming that you have played all of the previous titles.Overall opinion of the game is that I have been waiting for this title for a while and knowing everything from the beginning to the end is like watching a kid grow up. This would be like the adult version of the series cause there are less things that scare but there is alot more things done right. From the first title you saw the weak game engine, the firefights were intense but are less and less as the game progressed. The second titles extraction point and persus mandate (FEAR FILES FOR THE REST OF YOU) were short filler games that were suppose to lead up to FEAR 2 but somehow lost there way. And FEAR 2 was the turning point in the series cause it showed how to do it right. Just enough scare to keep you wondering what's around the next corner. And last FEAR 3 the RACE to stop mommy from giving birth. So this game is fast and quick paced to reach the end of the story. And what a story if you play from FEAR 1- FEAR 3 with all the titles in between and you will see the growth of this series. And why the dev's went with this 'style' of gameplay. COD and MOH are good titles in there own right but when you get tired of those titles pop this in for a quick change of pace. And one last thing, to any game studio that is thinking about making another game based off a movie this is how its done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}

I don't try and dissuade others but as expected this game is meant mostly for the younger players and while my friend may find himself entertained by these kind of games I'm more into the more adult oriented action games like Uncharted, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil to play myself.  The game does give you the option of playing the Star War saga episodes I-VI and seeing all the characters made up like this is a little funny as you see iconic characters from Luke Skywalker to Anakin Skywalker and friends and the effects animation and soundtrack as well as bonus extras are amazing for this game though I haven't used them all.

{"product_name":"B0009Z3K9E","description":"In order to save himself and protect the lives of those he loves, Soma must infiltrate the enemy's home base, a towering replica of Dracula's castle that is teaming with monstrous creatures. Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The DS Game Everyone Should Own!","reviewText":"If you loved Castlevania Aria of Sorrow, then it should be made a national law that you must pick up this game!  It takes off a year from where the former one ended, but it has been upgraded for the better, and unlike most other DS games, actually utilizes the touch screen to it's full advantage.Soma Cruz, from Aria of Sorrow, has been keeping his power of Dracula sustained for a year now.  When having a friendly chat with Mina, he is suddenly attacked by a derranged woman named Celia Fortner, a member of a cult that seeks to unleash Dracula's power and the only way she and her cult can be successful is by taking down Soma Cruz.  A fairly basic plot, but it has it's surprises.This is a pretty standard Castlevania game.  You control Soma, using his abilities and several weapons to take on the forces of evil in a sadistic village hideout where this cult resides.  As you go through you'll find new weapons, collect more souls and rise above your enemies.You'll start off with basic items and weapons.  Throughout each area Soma can use weapons such as a sword, a mace, a spear and plenty other to thwart his enemies.  Like Aria of Sorrow, Soma can absorb different souls from enemies.  Each soul has it's own priority.  Souls are also divided into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant and Ability.Bullet Souls are the souls which you'll use to vanquish your enemies.  They're your offensive souls, mainly.  Guardian Souls are souls Soma will use to transform into monsters and summon other monster.  Enchanted souls are souls that automatically take effect without you having to use them, such as increasing your strength and giving you the ability to absorb HP from other monsters.  And the ability souls are the souls Soma will HAVE to use in order to accomplish certain task. Each time Soma uses a soul he'll consume MP.  Like all Castlevania games (with the exception of Lament of Innocnce) your MP automatically restores itself over time.The really great thing about the DS is how the dual screens are used.  The game is played entirely on the touch screen.  The top screen displays the map at all times (something that makes the game flow A LOT faster), while you make all your movements on the bottom screen.  Along the way you'll obtain Magic Seals.  When activiated a shape is drawn on screen and you are to draw that shape as shown in order to unlock certain doors, and vanquish boss enemies.  Needless to say, you'll actually need your stylus in order to fully experience the game.  Not only that but in certain rooms you'll have to destroy crystals, this also requires the use of the stylus.As Soma defeats enemies he'll gain money and also level up.  Much like your classic action/adventure RPG.  Each time Soma levels up he'll need more and more experience.  He'll need to use money to buy more weapons, healing potions and other items needed along his journey.  However, it may not always be best to buy weapons.  Soma can synthesize weapons using souls.  In other words, if you have too many of a certain soul, you can use it to customize and create better weapons.Another really great trick is if you have Aria of Sorrow.  Before booting up your DS, put Aria of Sorrow in the GBA slot, and put Dawn of Souls in and start up your game.  Starting a new game with Aria of Sorrow inserted nets you extra items at the beginning of your journey and more story points.Graphically there is perhaps no better looking side-scroller Castlevania.  The movements are smooth, and the color is vibrant.  Each enemy moves at consistent rate, and there's hardly any slow down.Likewise, the music is incredible!  Castlevania doesn't usually disappoint with music, and Dawn of Sorrow is no different.  The music always fits with an area, and is powerful.  Soma's voice acting is also great.  Each time Soma swings a weapon, or sometimes when he jumps, he'll make a grunt or something.  It isn't overused (like in say... Super Mario Advanced) and it's the same voice used in Aria of Sorrow.The game doesn't present too much difficulty.  It starts off easy and gets increasingly harder.  Just what you'd expect from any game.  At some parts it is perhaps too easy, but we can deal.It was worth the wait for this game.  It plays smoothly, and finishes with incredible awe.  It's full of secrets and has a ton of replay value.  Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow does not disappoint.  Every Castlevania fan should get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2005"}

Weir","summary":"Believe the hype!","reviewText":"Well I won't spend too much time on this as I'm probably only about 1/3rd through the single player story, but all I can say is WOW.  Uncharted 2 easily has the best graphics of any console game to date.  I found my jaw gaping wide open many times throughout the 3 hours I spent playing it yesterday. I know that's such a generic thing to say but it's true.  The controls are tight and responsive and the voice acting and music are top notch. Production values are through the roof - this is the closest you will get to playing the lead role in a summer blockbuster action film. Easily a game of the year contender.Multiplayer is pretty solid bringing a variety of team deathmatch modes and a co-op mode.  A lot of games tack on poorly made multiplayer modes just for the sake of having one, but Uncharted 2 really delivers.  Team deathmatch is fun, if not a little repetitive, but often matches will devolve into players running around performing melee attacks as it's much quicker to get kills that way (players are bullet sponges), which is frustrating. I haven't tried co-op yet but I hear it's basically like getting a second game for free.  I doubt the deathmatch modes will have the longevity of those found in the forthcoming Modern Warfare 2, but this should keep fans of deathmatch plenty busy until MW2 launches next month.Bottom line is every PS3 owner should own this excellent game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

Have you tried the demo in a store?  Do you think that demo was worth $40?  Because that demo contained 80% of what you will be doing in Pilotwings Resort.  This game can be beaten in under 4 hours, and has little to no replayability.  There are only two different modes of play in Pilotwings Resort: Free Flight and Mission Flight. In the former, you're given just two minutes to explore Wuhu Island and the surrounding area while keeping an eye out for collectibles.  In Mission mode you fly around trying to complete a number of set challenges to get a star rating.  What's missing, sadly, is a way for you to compare your scores with those of other players--even those with a profile on the same cartridge!The controls are mostly solid, but occasionally a little wonky.  The D pad is somewhat awkwardly used to look around, but it's only while using the rocket belt that you're likely to spend much time doing so because you land it vertically. For that reason, while using the rocket belt you can simply tap the right shoulder button to look straight down. Other, mission-specific controls include using the right shoulder button to take photos while gliding and using the Y button to shoot while flying the plane. There are no stylus options whatsoever.The game lacks both the variety and the length to be recommended without hesitation, it feels like Nintendo should have included this for free with the 3DS as the \"Wii Sports\" pack-in.  I would only recommend buying this game if you could get it for $14.99 or less.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2011"}

If you can play in 3D, you get a wonderful sense of depth as you curl lazily around the lighthouse or shoot through the natural arch of stone. If you need to play in 2D for headache or other reasons, the game is still perfectly playable and fun.Each type of vehicle gives a different type of experience. The plane lets you zoom high in the air and bank sharply around objects. The jetpack gives you precision control like a hummingbird. I adore the hang glider best of all. It is incredibly peaceful to drift across the island, taking in the beauty, and floating with the birds.There are multiple modes of gameplay here. You can simply take your time exploring the island, looking for all the I markers which tell you about the interesting points. You can also do their challenges where you have to land in a certain spot, follow a certain path, or so on. Each time of gameplay has its own rewards. You also unlock features (time of day, etc.) as you go.I enjoy this game immensely. I'm not shooting enemies or destroying things. I'm challenged, yes, but it's an internal challenge - can I make that turn? Can I land exactly on the bulls-eye? The ramp-up of their tutorials is great. They help you learn the skills you need while having fun at the same time.Are there any down sides here? I suppose if you found flying around boring then you'd probably not like this game. There aren't zombies to demolish. No vampires. No swearing.But for most players, I think this game is a perfect part of your 3DS collection of games. There are times when it's quite fun to sit back, relax, and test out your flying skills.

Features an incredible storyline to immerse you in stylized action. Gameplay involves hair-raising missions both on foot and in vehicles with a plethora of weaponry to remedy tight situations. Driv3r's detailed cities boast over 30-square miles of drivable roads!","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Impressive Game","reviewText":"I know this game has dissapointed a lot of fans, but before anyone dismisses this review, for being too generous, there are plenty of very unpolished aspects to this game, but I also have plenty of reasons as to why this game is worth playing.Comparing this game to the Grand Theft Auto series has already been done countless times, but it simply cannot be helped.  This game will attract the same audience, and plays, at least on paper, very much the same as Rockstar's series.  However, this game is NOT Grand Theft Auto.  Sure, you can steal cars, and wreak havoc in three huge cities, but that's pretty much where the similarities end.  Unlike GTA's free-roaming gameplay, which allows presents players with multiple missions at once, and allows gamers to tackle them in the order they choose, Driv3r's story mode is completely linear.  You'll be given one mission at a time, and the story will progress much like a movie.  Most of the game has you behind the wheel of one of a huge selection of vehicles ranging from motorcycles, to boats, to eighteen-wheelers.  There aren't liscensed cars from real car manufacturers, but these vehicles take such a realitic beating, I can't imagine why a real car company would want to see their cars in the game.  You'll play through three realisticly modeled cities, all of which look and feel picture perfect, and very real.  You'll start in Miami, and eventually work your way through missions in Nice and Istanbul.  But not all of the game takes place in a car, about a fifth of it has you on foot, gunning through enemies in either a third or first-person perspective.  While, this can be fun for a while, the aiming is a bit touchy, and the enemies never move, or duck for cover.  They simply stand, shoot, and get shot.  Plus, the range of moves your character, (returning serie's star Tanner, voiced by Michael Madsen of Kill Bill) is given is extremely limited.  You can: run, walk, shoot, duck, and roll forward.  There aren't any slow-mo dives like in Max Payne, no pressing against walls and jumping out from corners like in Metal Gear, no taking hostages like the Getaway; just very straightforward running and shooting.  You're given a handful of weapons, including handguns, machine guns, and a grenade launcher, which will send cars flying, or simply shatter them into auto parts.  You can, however, shoot out tires, windshields, windows, and bumpers, which is cool, plus the game models bullet-holes on the car's bodies which is cool if you are going to toy around with the game's Film Director mode, which was featured in the first two installments in the series but has been completely re-wroked for this game.  But I'll get into that later.So, shooting is a bit disappointing, but still dumb fun.  But driving is flawless.  Speeding through three real world cities, through alleyways, around corners...  It is isn't only fun, it's almost addicting.  Each car controls uniqely, so don't expect an eighteen wheeler to control like a sports car.The driving missions can be a lot of fun, but mostly consists of just a few scenarios that keep repeating: escape from a tail, chase a car, or drive to a location and start shooting.The game offers players three different game mode's: Undercover mode, which is the game's story mode, Driving Games mode, which offers players a number of short but effective minigames with which to perfect their driving skills, and Take a Ride mode, which is basically the game's go-anywhere mode, where you are free to roam the three cities without time limits or missions.But, in my opinion, the real reason to play this game is the Film Director's mode.  As an aspiring director, this mode has been the reason I have purchased each installment of this series, but casual players should really dig it as well.  Plus,it has been re-worked, and re-tooled, making it more powerful, and easier to use.  Basically, Film Dircetor let's you save a replay from a mission you've played, and mini-game you've run through, or even from the Take a Ride mode, and then choose your own camera angles, locations, and effects, and direct it from the beginning.  This time, Film Director includes some options which I have been hoping would appear in the Driver series for sometime:  It gives you new camera angles, which include a rotating Chase cam, and a wheel-cam, (positoioned behind the front-right wheel), plus it offers you returning camera angles including first-person perspective, and tripods.  This time players can control the tripod's zoom completely.  But, best of all, picture effects have also been included.  You can now add slow-motion or motion-blur to your replays, which are two ways to better illustrate the game's realistic crashes and destruction.The game, while not including blood, still earns it's mature rating, by letting players hit pedestrians, (a first for the series) and shoot innpcent civilians and policemen, even while the citizens are still behind the wheel of their car.All in all, though, if you look past the violence, this is an impressive game, with terrific visuals, and amazing physics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2004"}

The original Fallout was an overhead view dungeon/landscape game along the lines of StarCraft or Diablo.  The second game was about the same except for a ton of bugs, and then came this one, which is an RPG first person shooter.The premise of the game is a little kooky, that some time in the mid 21st century America reverts to a 1950's mentality, replete with cars with fins, bomb shelters, and a strong anti-communist stance.  However, this being the future there are ray guns, nuclear powered vehicles, plasma weapons and intelligent robots, but computers themselves seem more typical for 1980.  In 2077 a catastrophic nuclear war happens, and the survivors stay in underground vaults, one of which in Washington D.C. is never opened to the outside until two hundred years later.Like most RPG's you choose your character's persona and appearance, but unlike the others you follow your character from birth until about 18 when they enter the outside world.  Your guide to the world is a Pip-Boy, a wrist computer that serves as your inventory, quest, and map center.You have tons of quests, and as with most RPG's there were several I ended up out of sequence on and couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be doing, but it wasn't as bad as some games like Stalker.  Your character has pretty clearly defined good, evil, and neutral choices, and the combat/enemy AI is not Call Of Duty but acceptable.  Until you have been to several different places and therefore have them mapped to travel instantly the game can seem way too hard, and it's also some time until you get into the powerful weapons.Overall the game is engaging and has a good storyline, but still had a few serious flaws, as below:Sooner or later your character has to sleep to recover, many of the medicines wear off and the Stimpacks only restore hit points.  This wouldn't be so bad except you can only sleep in a bed and those are hard to find.  Why can't you just sleep on the ground or camp out?  You also get poisonings of all kinds ridiculously easy.The landscape and terrain is all a depressing palette of washed out shades and muted somber tones.  However, rather than being truly stark many of the rocks and hills have an almost cartoonish metal like look to them.  After several hours of gameplay I was really wanting to see some sun and bright colors.You have to build up your arsenal and inventory, keep your weapons repaired, and sometimes hunt for items on quests.  That requires endless scavenging and digging around, and can get monotonous.The future is just a little too weird, an economy based on bottle caps and somehow after two hundred years of post-apocalypse warfare computers still have power and high tech weaponry still works.I could ignore these flaws for the most part except for the repetition, some levels with different color schemes or a way to maintain your weapons and inventory without so much digging would have greatly helped.  Still, it's a very good game and has already spawned several missions packs and an upcoming sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2010"}

They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power. During your adventure to complete your Pokedex and become the Champion, these two Pokemon, and Team Galaxy, will intertwine into the story and lead you on a fantastic journey across the Sinnoh region.When you set off on your travels, you'll be able to play as either a boy or girl Trainer.

Pokemon fans have caught glimpses of Mime Jr., Lucario, Munchlax and Weavile in Pokemon movies, and these Pokemon will be debuting in this adventure.","reviewerName":"EpsilonX","summary":"its good, but the worst of the series imo","reviewText":"I'm sorry to say, but this has got to be the least fun pokemon game i've ever played.  After I get through the bad stuff tho, I will list some good stuff.  So don't skip this review.The game is fun, but, personally I think the online aspect ruins it.  You can get all sorts of stuff through trading that you usually won't be able to get too easily, and I find that a tad annoying.  Plus, The dialogue is terrible.  It's gotten extremely cheesy and at points i was shocked at how bad it is.  The bad guy team in this game was also really annoying, and the fact that half the members of it didn't seem to have a clue what was going on didn't help.  Theres also many new terrain types which are no fun at all, such as snow, fog, and swamps.  Fog you can't see a darn thing when you're walking around, and the only way to clear it is to use an HM move.  I don't like to have to remove my good attacks to put really weak HM attacks on my pokemon just to get further in the game, and this game seems to really emphasize HM's.The pokemon gyms have also turned into giant puzzles which take quite some time to figure out at times.  While this is probably welcome for most people as it adds a new level of gameplay, I personally prefer the walk in the room and beat up the leader approach of older games gyms.But what really killed it for me is the lack of stuff to do after you beat the game.  I love being able to continue playing a game after I beat it, and most pokemon games (especially gold and silver) have stuff to do afterwards.  Pokemon Diamond and Pearl do have stuff, but it is incredibly boring.  I continued playing for about 3 days after I beat it, and got bored and stopped.  I managed to get over 100 hours of gameplay out of pokemon ruby after i beat the elite 4.  (i had about 180 hours of gameplay before I started over, and it probably took 50 or less to beat the story mode)If you don't mind this lack of fun after you beat the game, then by all means get it.  And if the ability to get almost anything in the game online appeals to you, then, you should probably already have this game.  But I found those parts to be annoying, so, It is my least favorite in the series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2007"}

I mean that! Twilight Princess was a great game, but Zack And Wiki is so beautiful in every way that it easily puts it about the newest Zelda in my opinion.What Zack And Wiki gets a lot of influence from is those great point and click graphic adventures that came out for the PC in the early to mid '90's. You know, King's Quest, Sam And Max, Monkey Island, Full Throttle, etc. You find item a and try to find exactly how and where to use within a certain puzzle. It might seem easy at first, but it's a lot harder of a game than it leads on to be. In any one level you might have to use 10-20 items in unique and clever ways just to reacj the treasure box that acts as the end of a level. It's not ALWAYS hard, but even the hard levels give you a great sence of accomplishment once you figure them out.You move Zack entirely with the Wii's remote. You point at the screen wherever you want him to walk and push \"A\". Enemies are scattered here and there and shaking the remote turns your buddy Wiki into a bell that will turn enemies into useful items. See a centipede? Ring the bell and it will turn into a saw you can use to cut wood. Bats turn into umbrellas, frogs into bombs. There's HUNDREDS of enemies that turn into other helpful items to help you get throug eachlevel.The motion sensing for the game is awesome. Since the game isn't very action oriented, and as such you don't need precise timing with most puzzles, using the remote to do everything works amazingly well. You'll be turning keys just like you would in real life, sawing through woods just like in real life, throwing things just like you would in real life and so on. There's only one place I thought the controls didn't work right, and that's when you meet a character that wants you to play a timed mini game with him. You must pull up at the right time to keep the beat, and the controls are just not quite responsive enough to pull it off. Even after 25 tries I couldn't do it. But thankfully, playing that part is just optional.There's not much in the away of voice acting in the game, but what little there is is done in Japanese just to show emotion. It's kind of cool really, and Zack and Wiki can be quite funny as well, especially when they happen to die on you.The graphics are pretty amazing for the Wii. Granted, this doesn't look as nice as a 360 or PS3 game, but on my HDTV it still looks great. It's made by Capcom, and it has that deep dark and rich color style Capcom games are famous for. The game really impresses when you manually zoom the camera out and you can see the entire level you're in in full 3D.Well, what can I say? I own quite of few Wii games, some great, some I wish I never had bought. But none of them are as great as Zack And Wiki. Buy this game (it's only 40 bucks!), and let's hope Nintendo themselves take a look at this game to see how Wii games should be made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2007"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization.

But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

First off, the graphics that look half cartoony really aren't that annoying; you get used to them rather quickly, and they're still clear and beautiful. The world of Pandora is HUGE! There are so many places to discover. Not to mention all of the missions: way too many to count! When you think you're done with an area you find out there are still more missions to do. I've heard some people say that the game is a bit repetitive, but for me it really wasn't so bad or even that horribly repetitive; if it was, I hardly noticed. I love all the challenges there are to complete because they make you feel totally badass. The special abilities of each character are cool, there are tons of weapons, the leveling up system is pretty fair, and there were only a few missions that I died quite a few times before beating it...for the most part, the game is not too hard, but also not too easy. Overall a fantastic game! PS...if you can afford it, definitely download the add-on content.

{"product_name":"B00006Z7HR","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Not quite what I expected after reading reviews....","reviewText":"Dark Cloud 2 is a worthy attempt to craft a fun action RPG type game.(+) DC2 has great voiceovers for all of the characters, and has amazing cel-shaded graphics. The weapons build up system is pretty addictive, and there is no lack of dungeons. The characters are pretty cool too.(-) The game has NO STORYLINE and its 50 hours long. Now I have no problem playing a good RPG for 50 hours, but if I'm playing I'd at least like good character development and a cohesive storyline. DC2 has virtually no real character development, and the story is the most cliched and predictable I've ever seen in an RPG. Maybe it's just because I'm hardcore RPG and have played all the best, but I have to say that storyline is a HUGE part of an RPG. The dungeons in the game are incredibly repetitive with basically the same exact monsters with slightly altered appearances. The dungeons are even worse since each dungeon has about 20 levels that all look exactly the same with the same exact enemies. Although having 2 characters might seem good, leveling up isn't easy, and resources for upgrading weapons are limited, and new materials are expensive, so you'll basically have to choose one over the other early on or end up with 2 weak characters. In particular, Monia is basically the more useless of the 2 characters. Maybe if it didn't have such a kiddy feel to it. You'd think that if it's rated T for teen, they'd atleast have adult or teenage characters that are viable to play with. After reading the reviews, I would have thought the game would be fun, but needless to say I was very dissapointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2005"}

It's far more comparable to Homeworld -- it's a space based RTS game.Like most RTS games, the tech trees are fairly shallow with limited options and units are not customizable beyond researching new techs for them.  There are three fairly similar races which are also not customizable.However, it's not all bad news.Although you'll likely be spending a lot of focus on overseeing large battles between fleets, there's also a lot of room to conduct secondary operations -- sending smaller strike teams out while the enemy is hopefully preoccupied with your main fleet.  A lot of RTS games simply don't reward this sort of thing very well but in Sins, it opens up a lot of strategic options.Multiplayer is integrated and well supported, including a feature that lets you save and resume multiplayer games.  This is something that RTS gamers have been asking for for years.Games can easily last several hours, depending on how many players and how big of a game you wanted.  Personally, I enjoy the option of having a \"big game\" rather than simply the small map 15-minute skirmishes most RTS games offer.The AI is pretty good and actually pretty amusing to have on your team.  AIs will communicate with each other through standard chat and will try to coordinate with you and each other.  (Enemy AI, on the other hand, tends to be annoying by making constant demands.  This is the \"diplomacy\" aspect of the game and frankly it would probably be more fun without it.)Graphics are very nice, should you choose to zoom in far enough to see them all, although the only reason to zoom in that far is to look at the graphics.  It's generally more practical to be zoomed out far enough that ships are dots.I think the bottom line for me is that I see this game as a good start.  It's really nothing new.  Real time space based empire games have been done before and arguably have been done better.  However, I see this game as having a strong potential as a platform that they can build on.  I don't regret my purchase but I'm more keenly interested in what they have in mind for Sins of a Solar Empire II.  Deeper tech trees?  More races?  Customizable ships and races?  There's a lot of room to expand and I hope they continue to build on it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"Tim","summary":"4 things that make this game GREAT!!","reviewText":"Wolverine is an A+++ game that a few \"official\" game reviewers wrongly gave a low score to. Here are 4 things that make it great.1) Button presses are very responsive!!! For example, when you fight a certain enemy who is over 14 feet tall, Wolverine can jump up high and do quick stabs to the enemy's upper body. As you are in mid-air, you can press the dodge button and Wolverine will do a mid-air dodge. So being in air does not prevent you from being able to do a dodge. You can do most of Wolverine's attacks whether you are on the ground or in the air.2) Environments are large and look good. There is a long \"view distant\". Like when you look out into the far distance, you can see the smoke and wreckage from a previous area that you recently destroyed. And the environments look realistic, like when you walk through the snow, the ice shines with realistic lighting, you see lots of snowflakes falling, and even Wolverine's footsteps are visible in the snow.3) Environments are interactive. Throw a person on a sharp tree branch and impale them, throw a person into a fuse box and electrocute them.4) Lots of blood and dismemberment. This is a M rated game, so you will see arms and legs being ripped off. People being cut in half at the waist. And blood spewing from the severed body parts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006KYYOSO","description":"","reviewerName":"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"","summary":"IF YOU LOVED TEKKEN 6 YOU WILL TOTALLY LOVE THIS ONE!","reviewText":"Tekken 6 was actually the very first video game I ever played bar none.  I was dazzled by the Tekken 6 graphics and  its easy game play.  I more than anything enjoyed the odd Tekken 6 characters.  I loved the fights, moves and venues where the Tekken 6 action takes place.  Now here comes Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 and it is even more awesome.  The graphics good as they were in Tellen 6 appear to be improved in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3.  Many of the same characters you knew and loved in Tekken 6 are reprized here in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3.  There are a few new characters.  The best thing about Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 is the fact you can engage in tag team play as an option.  For anyone who loved Tekken 6 they will find Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 to be more, brighter, faster and better.  Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 is a carefully crafted improvement of Tekken 6 that is not a radical departure except in tag team play which I find a very good thing.  Tekken 6 was the first and best fight video game I ever played.  On the strength and good experiences I had with Tekken 6 I brought Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 and I was SOOOOO NOT DISAPPOINTED!  Tekken Tag Tournament 2 PS3 is a must have game in my humble opinion and it is rare that I offer such high praise to any video game.The only negative in this new Tekken is the emphasis on juggling to win.  Juggling is a very cool strategy but their are other aspects to Tekken that are equally awesome.  Seems the Tekken developers went juggle crazy in this new Tekken and the game play suffers for it.  Tekken 6 used to be a game of strategy where juggle skills were part of a winning strategy.  In this new Tekken juggling is by itself a winning strategy just juggle an opposing character till their life bar is gone and you win makes for EXTREMELY BORING game play!  Master the juggle and beat the game how boring.  Fortunately I like a character whose best skill is not the juggle it is the thrown down.  He can juggle too but I find using juggle too easy.  I love to grab and throw opponents then give them a good hard kick or three.  Even with the jugglemannia issue in this new Tekken I still give it 5 stars and it  earned every one.

Evar.","reviewText":"Ultimately, Tekken 6 is just another Tekken game.That might seem like a good thing, given the overall quality of most of the past Tekken games, but, really, it's just a way of saying: if you already have the other ones, don't worry about this one.The same crop of characters with the same crop of moves in the same style of gameplay returns for the same old Tekken. With a few additions. Really, really crappy additions.If you're already familiar with Tekken, you know the drill. You choose your character and you wallop people in a twitch-style one on one fighting game. You can step into the foreground or the background, charge or step back, counter, etc.The gameplay is typically deep for a Tekken game. There are a large number of ways in which the characters' moves interact and a large number of characters and styles to choose from, however, this game is probably not for the button-mashers. Like other Tekken games, mastering the game requires an in-depth knowledge of every character so you can not only make the best use of your characters moves, but also anticipate and counter your opponents.But what's in this game isn't nearly as important as what's not. What are not there are significantly improved graphics, gameplay, or stories. Overall, Tekken 6 does a poor job of building on the mythos, gameplay, or technology of previous Tekkens.Worse yet, the game has some serious drawbacks and wastes of space. The rightly reviled Scenario Campaign mode is an abomination that requires you to play through a Final Fight style beat-em-up by repeatedly switching between the left analog stick to move and the directional pad to fight. Enemy difficulty in this mode is all over the place, with bosses that have two full-screen-length health bars, mini bosses that require dozens of strikes and common enemies that (with Devil Jin at least - use him as your free unlock at the start of the game) can easily be wiped out en masse with a single kick. Forget the fun mini games of the past Tekken games, Tekken 6 only offers a digital sadist for people who really enjoy hurting themselves.The last boss, Azazel, is also a ridiculous oversight. Some characters, particularly those that can't effectively juggle opponents, will struggle with continue after continue trying to down him between his unblockable and cheesy attacks while others such as Law can practically stick a broom handle up his rear end and wipe the floor with him.The online mode isn't much better. It's laggy and slow which can be very frustrating when trying to play a ranked match.The worst part, however, is the insane number of load screens and their lengths. Unless you actually sit and watch the story videos in campaign mode (which you probably won't because the translations are awful and most of the dialog is complete nonsense) the whole thing is virtually nothing but one long string of load screens between a few short stages. Character select lags while the game loads selection animations, it loads before a fight, it loads after a fight.... it's just one giant load screen sometimes.Overall, Tekken is a typical Tekken game if you ignore the abominable campaign mode, load times, and the poor-performing online mode, but that's why it's such a lousy Tekken entry. It's still fun to sit down and play against other people, but if you already have other Tekken games to play, there's no reason to really buy this one. Pick it up if you see it on clearance for a few bucks, but, otherwise, just pass this one up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00AY1CT4U","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon P. \"Brandon\"","summary":"Okay Game","reviewText":"Some good and some bad. I am going to try my best summarize to game. The running is new and better than the latest madden games but the problem is that if you play online, it is going to be hard to tackle the player, TRUST ME! Game got harder with players who knows how to run the ball and get away from their opponents. Tackling looks realistic in this game and I will give huge credit to the developers. Blocking is pretty bad still because sometimes linebackers will sneaky go through the linesmen when you do the Toss play and after the getting the ball, the opponent is already there to tackle you. The commentators are the same thing from Madden 13 but they have some new lines but we all the knew that they will say repeatedly the same thing. I was concern about the fans in the stadium are still like Madden 09 fans. I mean why can not improve them. They are apart of the environment in the football game and same goes with the players at the sidelines and they all look ratchet. It is the details that these creators have to fix or improve on to make this game more interesting for us to play even more. The field was okay but I expect better and the graphics were not good on the players. The throwing is really good and no comments about that. Intercepting the ball got really easy in this game. Just hold Y and 80 percent you will catch the ball so if you play online, think twice before you throw that ball because if you are going against opponents who know how to play, you are going to turnovers after turnovers. There are many mistakes in this game that it is hard to explain but if you really like football and madden, then get the game but just be prepare for the mistakes that you have to deal with and I think after these years of making this game, it is not going nowhere. This is almost like Madden 13 with updated players and some new stuff but same problems. Problems like blocking, speed quality, graphics, game play, and bad calls. Not bad game but for me, it is not worth it to buy the game :(","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2013"}

The game does not have online multiplayer, which really shortens the game's replay value. But if it was anything like the first, multiplayer wouldn't matter.The actual game is way behind RF1's simgle player mode. The levels are divided into short checkpoints, and there is only one way through the level. The original was one consistant world, in which there were mulitple ways of doing everything. There is no longer the option to use stealth. You can't hide bodies, go undercover, or even silence your pistol. The vechile levels are now rail-shooters, instead of giving you full contol, which makes them kinda boring. To make up for the lack of variety, the game is harder, even on easy. Swarms of enemies bombard you, and its not a fair fight.The Geo-Mod technology is still there, but it seems kind of useless here. In the first, you truly could make your own paths, blown around locked doors, or create new hiding places. Here, you can only destroy some walls, but tiny things will get in your way. I have a rocket launcher, why can't I destroy a tiny piece of rotting wood?Graphics are okay, but the framerate has problems. In the end, its just not as good as the first. At least the console verions had split-screen play. But with frustrating levels and lack of online play, there isn't much reason to play this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2003"}

There's nothing wrong with that, Brawl is one of the most competitive fighters I have ever played. There's a huge lovable roster, tons of stages, and a lot of power-ups to turn the tide of the battle. With the addition of online play, this is any Wii owners dream come true.Once you select your character, a choice of many, you can select the color, and also various stages from Melee and different Nintendo franchises. You can choose which power-ups to disable as well, but I just couldn't get over the huge roster. Link, Peach, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Kirby, Fox McCloud, Ganandorf, Sonic, Solid Snake, Samus Aran, Ness, Jigglypuff, Wolf, Captain Falcon, and a ton of others. This is a huge roster and nearly every character is recognizable. Once you get into the battle, that's where the fun begins.Brawl was confusing at first. It doesn't play out like normal fighters. There's no health meter, instead there's a percentage meter and your job is to keep yours down and get your opponent's up. You can reduce yours by eating food that falls, but the ultimate goal is to get the most KOs in one round. The controls are fairly simple, but take getting used to on the Wiimote. the best way to play is with a Nunchuk. Using the C stick to move around, A and B are your main attacks. B is your projectile/special and A is your normal attack. You vary the attacks but using different directions combined with these attacks. C allows you to jump and Z is your shield. This may seem way too simple compared to standard fighters, but it's kind of a breath of fresh air. The attacks look awesome, and the fighting is fast paced.Various power-ups fall on the battlefield like melee weapons, projectiles, and the one super finisher which is always fun. Hit this orb three times and you can unleash a deadly power attack. Just stand still and hit B. Some characters need to be close, some far away, and some hit the entire area and can't be avoided. These tend to be deal breakers for hardcore players, but they can be turned off. Honestly, the worst part about the game were how many bad stages there were. The ones where the levels constantly move up and down or to the right make the game feel like a platformer rather than a fighter. I hated these moving stages. It distracted from the core of the game. Some arenas were just way too small and there was no room to move around. There is a large enough variety though, so everyone will have favorites.Some characters are also unbalanced and over powered, while others are under powered. I felt Kirby, Samus, and Ness were over powered. On the flip side Zelda was under powered and felt boring to fight with, same goes with Wario. This may vary between players, but me and my partner both felt the same way. There is such a large variety that everyone will find there main character to fight with. I also found there was a lack of modes, with just Battle and online. The game is complete garbage with the AI, this game is only fun with another person.Overall, Brawl is a solid fighter that's fast paced and breaks away from the normal fighting formula. There are too many bad stages, over or under powered characters, and the game gets boring really quick due to the simple fighting system. The many power-ups will keep you busy and there are a lot of customization options, but in the end the game has limited appeal unless you are a hardcore Smash Bros. fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Scratchy","summary":"Very Good Sequel.","reviewText":"Very good but not great.  I absolutely loved Dragon Age: Origins after being on the fence about it for months.  So by the time i finished all the DLC and the expansion for DA:O I was extremely excited for the sequel so much so that i almost bought the signature edition after the 1/11/11 deadline.  Eventually decided to settle for the regular edition here on amazon and it was a great purchase.  One of the few games that i can proudly say i do not have buyers remorse for.  Many things about the first that i miss in the second but i quickly get over it when the action starts.Gameplay is solid.  The original had an auto attack function which left you free to scroll through your abilities and see which ones to use next.  Dragon age 2 has the same option if you play on PC but for consoles you actively engage in combat by pressing X or A in addition to the other buttons in order to use abilities.  It was a hassle at first as a melee character but as the hours go by, you get used to it and tend to realize that its actually more fun to actively be a part of the combat.Graphics are much much improved from the first game and by far make this a stunning game.  There are a few hiccups in the framerate from time to time but seeing how the game just came out im assuming that a patch or two will fix this easily.Characters are good but not as engaging and funny as in DA:O.  You get a few cameos from people you ran into from DA:O and in Awakening but other than that the character interactions arent as memorable as they were in the first.  Definately the conversations between party members while you roamed about was better in DA:O but the ability to choose wisecracks while you talk to every person in the game kept me amused enough to not miss it too much.  The ability to carry over your saves from DA:O was a great addition, it added some variety to the confrontations you got and let you meet some old acquaintances.  Even though fans of the original will love this aspect you do not need to play Dragon Age:origins to fully enjoy this game.  It has plenty of information that fills you in on everything that went on past and present.Story is hailed as being non-linear.  It is actually exactly that but my gripe is its a bit too loose.  You have no idea what is a main plot storyline or a side quest.  It's all kind of thrown in together.  Not that the story is weak or inferior its just that the game is sectioned off into acts and if you choose to finish a storyline quest you end up leaving potential side quests unfinished and unable to go back and finish them because of the time that passes in the game.Replay value much like all bioware games is huge.  There are so many different paths i could have taken or people i could have annoyed or chose to ally myself with that its exhausting to think of how i would do things different in a new playthrough.Overall this game is not exactly everything that i wanted the sequel to Dragon age : Origins to be but it forges its own path and makes a great game just the same.  If you enjoy RPGs with tons of action then pick this game up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2011"}

Its 1000 times better than Dance Dance Revolution, and 100 times better than Konamix.  FINALLY an American DDR with licensed songs!  You probably will recognize Sandstorm by Darude, and also I think the song Candy (which appeared in the arcade DDR MAX) is a liscensed song.  Despite this, there are still no songs like Butterfly and Dam Dariram.  Not really a big deal though, I'm just happy its not all Konami orignals.I think one of the good things about MAX is that it has more gameplay value than the other DDR games.  About half of the songs must be unlocked, kind of like Konamix.  Remember though, this is a PS2 game.  That means one thing: Much MUCH more songs, over 65 of them.  (I dont know the exact number because I havent unlocked them all yet)  More songs means more time spent unlocking them all.  More time spent playing a game for me means I've got my money's worth.There are several ways to unlock songs.  One way is to do something new in the game, like fail a song for the first time.  Another way is to play 1 round of 5 songs.  Every time you do that, you unlock a new song.DDR MAX, like the arcade version, has the freeze arrows where you have to hold your foot down on the arrow untill it completely passes.  This can a difficult change for newer DDR players, but you shouldn't worry.  The game, also like the arcade, has the menue that can be brought up by holding down the X or the O key when you select a song.  In this menue you can turn off the freeze arrow, and also speed up the song or put on other cool options.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2002"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"good fun","reviewText":"Rogue Galaxy is the latest game from the creators of Dark Cloud, which means it retains many of the good features that the series developed in its two main games. This latest installment is more mature, with a more far-reaching agenda and some characters with a bit of extra depth. The cartoon style graphics are still being used, but they look great. My only regret is that the game clearly steals many of it's new features from Final Fantasy XII!The story is the usual...how many more times must I type this: a young adventurer called Jaster dreams of being a space pirate and exploring the galaxy. By chance (mistaken identity) he is picked up by a band of pirates, and they go off in a simple search for treasure, only to stumble across a plan to destroy the whole world. So that's that, then, now let's get onto the mechanics.The battles are quite fun. A bit like Star Ocean or Kingdom Hearts for the PS2, you have a battle party of 3 from your total team of about 8. Battles are real time, and apart from the player you control, the other two team members act on AI. The settings for this are very basic, so your team mates will basically attack one target, attack nearest target, or do nothing. To add more creativity, the game has included \"suggestions', which work quite well. While battle is underway, your two team mates will shout out for your attention, basically when they think a good special attack or item is needed. Sometimes its a heal potion, but more often, it is a request to do one of their special moves. Now because battles are quite hectic, this rather annoying sounding feature actually works pretty well. Most of the time I was charging into battle with my controlled character and leaving the other two to their own devices. A quick glance at the HP levels, which are always visible on screen (even if the team mates are not) gives you a warning if things are getting out of hand. But even so, the suggestions come at pretty good moments, always offering to heal if someone is approaching 50% or so of HP left, or use a crowd clearing attack if everyone is healthy. You can quickly accept the suggestions with one click and then get straight back to your own devices, so it does feel like real teamwork. Everyone has a few signature moves of their own, and one \"limit break\" style super attack which takes special strike-points to collect before it can be executed. This ultimate attack (called a Burning Strike) is possible even harder than FFXII's Quickening chains to pull off, as it demands that you watch two areas of the screen at the same time and hit buttons to an exact timing - not easy!Battles are pretty dynamic and can turn nasty very swiftly if you don't watch what's going on. Luckily level-building is not too much of a chore and upgrades to weapons is pretty constant. This feature is carried over from the Dark Cloud games, because weapons can be combined together to form new, stronger ones, and their features modified with other items. You can spend a lot of time in this game seeking out dozens of weapons (each person has two weapon types that they use), and mixing them together to make better ones. And you'll need them - Monsters are mean and relentless, and some of them can be tough - even regular dungeon monsters can be annoying - especially if they have shields up. Out of all the good features of the game, this one really annoyed me. Jaster has a very weak gun which has the sole feature of being a barrier breaker - any monster that has a barrier needs it removing before you can do any damage, and only this gun can do it. The result is that you'll be endlessly swapping this barrier-break gun into play to break defence and then out again to damage them with a stronger one (as the barrier-break gun does zero actual damage). In later dungeons where lots of enemies have this shield it becomes a MAJOR pain to keep going to the menu for this over and over again. But that's one of the few niggles I had with battles...the other one might be that it's hard to tell who your player is targetting when there are several enemies on screen.On the subject of creation, the old \"town building\" feature of Dark Cloud has also been retained in the Factory, where you can build complicated production lines to synthesize new items out of various things that you find throughout the game. This has always been a fun feature of the series. Items to be collected include things like lipstick, bananas, music boxes, flowers, bits of metal, small animals, masks and jewels, all of which have no use in the game except as factory ingredients. You could spend a very long time in the Factory mini game just trying to create new items, and it can be quite a fun distraction.As for size, the game does not have that much to offer in locations, but boy, some of those dungeons are LONG! (if you play it, chances are that the Two Towers will try your patience quite a bit!).There are only about 6 planets so travel is a breeze. The in-game map is vital as the dungeons are often huge labyrinths constructed of cookie-cutter repeat corridors, but they still look pretty good, even with the repetition.Let me just say again at this point, however, that some of the games ideas are clearly \"inspired\" by Final Fantasy XII, most notably the save icons, which also teleport you, the ability to swap team members in battle, and the Two Towers dungeon which looks remarkably like another tall tower in FXII. It also has a \"quarries\" sub-game, which is a direct copy of FFXII's \"hunts\". However it's probably an easier game to play...some of the bosses look great but none of them are particularly hard if you take a bit of care. The ending is also pretty good, with quite a long chain of bosses to kill without any saving allowed (hint - make sure to level up characters evenly!).Overall, a good, solid fun game to play with no real letdowns. Put some time in and you'll soon be hooked all the way to the end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2008"}

Well first off, they are wrong. In the past few years, I have seen some major improvements in the Call of Duty franchise. Most would say(including me) that these improvements are legendary. And Black Ops amps it all the way up!Lets start off with the single player campaign. You are an agent who's identity is wiped out from the records. His name is Alex Mason. This game starts off by you waking up in an electric chair. You are being interrogated to get answers. Now I'm not going to tell any more about the story. So lets jump to the gameplay. If you want an intense single player campaign and gameplay, this is it. This gameplay is fast and energetic. You will be glued for hours. If I must, I will point out one flaw to this game: the graphics have to load up. That's it though. It does not affect the gameplay what so ever. Oh, just to let you know, the levels are flashbacks to get the answers I was previously talking about.Okay, I've gotten through the single player, now lets go to the multiplayer! I have heard major flack about the multiplayer. Treyarch amped up the multiplayer to a whole new level. You get a way bigger variety of multiplayer modes. And the truth is, you get some pretty wacky modes. For example, you get wager matches. I gotta to tell you, that could very well be the best mode. Okay, so the multiplayer maps are pretty good. But you might not want to get this game if you like to snipe in multiplayer. There aren't any advantages for sniping. But if you just want to go to an all out bloody battle, this is an absolute must own. Just to let you know, if you love all out bloody battles, you will absolutely love a multiplayer level called Nuketown.So if you want a CoD with an intense single player campaign and a highly anticipated multiplayer, this is a must own. So if you do want this game, go pick it up at any local game store ana make it a great day!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}
