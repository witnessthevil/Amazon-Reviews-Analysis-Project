While it does use the same engine as many popular shooting games, Mirror's Edge really does strive to be something different. Mirror's Edge has flaws but overall the game is very enjoyable and worth a play-through.There are shooter aspects to Mirror's Edge. You can pick up pistols and rifles and use them to take out your enemies if you wish to do so. In fact, there are a couple areas in the game that are much easier to get through if you use a gun to shoot through a glass window. With all of that said, the game's combat system is much smoother when you use unarmed combat. Your character can perform disarms, slides, kicks and punches to defeat opponents. There is actually a major trophy/achievement for getting through the entire game without shooting a single person.The controls are easy to pick up. It won't take long for you to be able to make your character run along walls and leap over rooftops. Some areas of the game will require you to quickly string together a number of moves such as running along a wall, pivoting and jumping towards a pipe and then swinging from the pipe onto a platform.The graphics are a mixed bag. There are times that are actually breathtaking such as running along the arm of a crane perched on a skyscraper roof. I truly felt momentarily dizzy during two key parts of the game. My gripe about the graphics is most of the building exteriors look so pristine. I would have preferred a game centered so heavily on the urban culture to look a little more grungy. Both the PS3 and the 360 can display environments with many more textures such as those in Bioshock 2.A very well put together game that not many people noticed. I paid $11 for it brand new. If you can find it for between $15 and $20 new it would be a good deal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

The moron in me thought I had a broken system.  I assumed it came on when I plugged it in or hit the power button on the controller.  Then I realized there was a power button on the top of the system.  haha  So, once I got it on, I set up my internet.  It did not work.  I was like ghosdtgpsdh!!!!  Then I realized the letters I was putting in for our WEP were lower case, while on the router they are cap.  So, I put them in as caps and the thing worked!  Actually first I had clicked to hide our network.  I had to restart the thing and it detected it.  So that was fine.The thing is very nice looking when you are online.  The store looks so freaking crisp and clean.  It is super easy to go through the store and check everything out.  They have different categories in the store.  Stuff like indie, staff picks, backer games and then they have the categories.  Like adventure, RGP and so on.  I just sat there looking at the freaking store.  It looks so freaking good.As far as credit cards go, I did not really want to put mine in just yet.  I do not know enough about the company.  So, I got a Visa gift card.  It worked perfectly.  Though, when I got to the part to enter a credit card, it said credit or gift card.  Am I to assume that they will have Ouya gift cards you can get?  If so, then that is what I will buy.  They ask you to verify your email.  Then, when you are done, they ask you to read and make sure you have entered the correct one.  I think that is a good thing.  It would suck to have the wrong email in.Now as for the controller.  I freaking love it.  It is very odd feeling at first.  It is a big controller.  But once I started playing, it felt great.  Sometimes, when playing a game on 360 or PS3, my pinkies will go numb.  hahahaha It is just the way I am holding the controller I guess.  But the Ouya controller felt great the entire time.  I like how the controller always felt cool to the touch.  It is simple to but batteries in.  You just take the piece off the front left and right and put them in.  Some said there controllers came with the top parts broken off.  Well, mine did not.  They had tape over each side of the controller.  Maybe they read what people were saying and fixed it.The games.  Well, I have a bunch of games.  I have yet to pay for any.  It was late and I did not want to buy just yet.  But, The few I played were so freaking fun.  The kind of thing that you start playing at like noon and then you look at the clock and it's 4pm.  The controls for some felt odd.  Sometimes it seemed as if the controls did no work at all.  I would hit the jump button and not movie.  The one button can stick.  But you have to hold it down and really push to have it do so.  It never did it for me unless I tried to make it do so.  But I am 100% happy with the controller.One thing to add.  The system got kind of hot.  I had played for a couple of hours and it felt very warm.  I would not say it would burn your hand.  But still, it felt warm.  Also, the memory stick I had in, which did not work yet, was very hot.  I hope I am not playing one day and I see a poof of smoke and the Ouya is gone.  I am sure if will be fine though.For those out there saying this or that went wrong, you must understand that this thing is new.  If you re interested in it, buy it.  There may be some kinks to work out, but there is a lot of fun stuff to do with it while they work them out.  I know people say they already have a cell phone or a tablet.  As do I.  But, I will never play a game on my cell.  Unless I am sitting in the doctors or something and while my iPad is fun, playing a game on my TV will always be my first choice.  The Ouya is already one of the funniest things I have.  This coming from a guy who owns all this and last gens systems.  Who has both new systems pre ordered and who owns most of the older systems.  The Ouya is just freaking great fun.  Save $20 for 5 weeks and buy your little Ouya.  They are back in stock on Amazon now.  For all those who got inpatient, canceled their pre orders and got them at a retail store, I can only say this.  Neener, neener weener!!!!One thing that I forgot to add.  When I first turned the system on, it showed up on my TV.  Then the TV went black.  On, black, on, black.  All I had to do was turn my TV off and back on and it stopped.  It did not do that on my Grandparents TV, when I brought it over to show them today.  So I guess it all depends on the type of TV you have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2013"}

Create a character, pick your power sets, design your costume and you've pretty much gone through 90% of the customization of the game.  Because CoH has no true economy or item system to speak of, your focus will not be the accumulation of wealth.  Your character's appearance is determined at creation and cannot be modified ever again, which in combination with the lack of items and economy, leaves little for many players of MMORPGs to focus on.  After all, what's the point of playing if you can't quest for that ultra-powerful weapon that glows and only two other people on your server have?All you have in City of Heroes is your reputation as a player.  The game is a true roleplayer's dream world: all you have to focus on is your character's growth and involvement with your fellow players.  Those who've always liked comic books and envision themselves as a superhero of ANY variety will have a field day in CoH: you learn of a drug lab in an abandoned warehouse, enter alone or with a team and fight hordes (literally 10-20 at a time in some cases) of thugs.  You see a mugging as you wander the street and utter a battlecry as you punch the offender's face in: the bystanders flee in a very realistic way and the victim you save runs up to thank you when you're done.But the experience would lose its charm quickly if the actual game dynamics weren't up to par.The combat system is pretty innovative: it requires more conscious thought and team tactics than most other games.  Unlike other MMORPGs, where every party member follows a formula that can be macroed with relative ease, CoH's combat is fast paced because almost every encounter entails multiple enemies at once.  While crowd control certainly exists, the dynamics of ordinarily straightforward roles like Tanks and Nukers is changed drastically when faced with multiple opponents.CoH's designers also clearly had your friends in mind when they made the game.  Unlike FFXI, which made it a battle to even get onto the same server as your friends, CoH provides numerous ways to ensure you're still able to play with your friends.  The acceptable level spread for a party is much wider than most games, and parties of level differences in excess of 5 are not uncommon.  The sidekick system also allows you and a friend to play together regardless of your level difference: sidekick, and poof, almost the same level as your friend (on a temporary basis, and without the additional abilites gained by leveling).The world isn't very big, but you have incentive to explore it all as the mission system takes you to randomly generated locations around the various city areas.  This has the added bonus of removing camping problems from the game: when your team takes a mission, you are the only ones able to enter the (randomly generated) mission location.Character customization is about average.  Aside from the costume possibilities (NCSoft lists the number of possible permutations in excess of 2.0 x 10^27), once you've picked your power sets, you're going to have the same basic abilities as everyone else.  The ability to choose from power pools is nice, but without equipment, there are clearly limits.  Enhancing your powers with (aptly named) enhancements allows for a limited amount of customization: do you want your energy beam to travel farther, do more damage, or hit more consistently?On a more technical note, CoH had one of the cleanest, smoothest MMORPG launches to date, with relatively few bugs and almost no server problems (I have yet to encounter either myself).  They offer no live customer support, but their CS team e-mails you back about issues promptly and with a minimum of automation.On the whole, CoH is an interesting experience geared toward those interested in roleplaying and character progression as opposed to ph4t l3wt.  If that sounds interesting to you, or if you have a desire to put on a mask and combat evil, get the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2004"}

Compete with a friend over local wireless or Nintendo WFC as you guide Link through special battle stages to capture Force Gems or command the forces that oppose him!","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A welcome debut on the DS","reviewText":"Like a lot of franchises, the Legend of Zelda tends to add a couple of different gameplay mechanics to make it feel like a different game, but fundamentally you're still getting the same thing. But when you have the \"if it ain't broke...\" adage fitting perfectly, one can understand Nintendo's reluctance to completely overhaul the series. With Phantom Hourglass, it's kind of like Minish Cap-style presentation with some of the more unique controls found in Twilight Princess. Does it make it a great game? Well it certainly does have the classic gameplay but it might not have the classic status of Ocarina of Time or even an underrated one like the Oracle series.Story: Taking place a couple months after Wind Waker, Link is onboard the pirate ship with Tetra when they come across a mysterious ghost ship. Mind on treasure, Tetra goes onboard only to disappear and Link thrown overboard. He arrives on an island and with the help of a ship captain, Linebeck and a fairy named Ciela, Link searches for the ship to save his friend.Graphics: Some might find it similar to Final Fantasy III's DS remake but that doesn't mean the graphics are bad. In fact, this is probably some of the most detailed and lively graphics on the DS. It really does have that kind of \"miniature Gamecube\" feel in some of the scenes.Sound/Music: Zelda at times had the best music when it stuck to the familiar themes. Not saying the music's bad here, of course not, but there's times where you like the music playing but there really isn't that distinctive theme until you go \"hey wait, is that a remixed version of Zelda's Lullaby?\" But maybe it's just me.Gameplay: Last time it was changing into a wolf, now, um, well there is the titular hourglass. Beating bosses fills up the hourglass a bit which allows more time to complete the dungeon of the Ocean King. Getting more items allows further access into the dungeon. It's a nice idea but it would nice if we didn't feel like going through the floors again in order to get to the next section. There is a halfway point but it would be nice if you can \"zap\" to the next section.Along with Twilight Princess, this is probably one of the most different in terms of controlling Link. Done entirely (let me repeat, ENTIRELY, no control pad here) with the stylus, Link at times even controls better. Instead of locking in, you just tap the enemy and Link lunges with his sword; do a swipe and he'll horizontal slash or draw a circle around Link and he'll spin dash. Even using items like boomerangs and bombs are funner to use thanks to user-controlled flight paths for the former or precise throwing for the latter.It's moving Link around the field that feels unpolished. Have the stylus farther away from Link and he runs, closer and he's slower or draw circles on the outside of the screen and he'll roll. There are times where you fall off cliffs because you pushed too far away, causing a sprint rather than a walk and rolls can be a pain to pull off. There was also a couple times where you have bomb flowers and pointing to them has Link pick them and instead you sword swipe them, causing them to explode in your face.The sailing's more easier now. You just draw a path on your map and take a breather while firing a cannon now and then at enemies. However, it's this streamlining that might bug players who don't like the decrease in difficulty. Gone are the days of Link to the Past and the Oracle series where you can get easily stomped if you're not careful, Minish and Hourglass have a more accessible difficulty where you're not cursing the game because of one frustrating dungeon - Water Temple, anyone? - but still, the game depends on your skill as a Zelda gamer. Newbies can easily grasp it eventually while veterans might find the lack of difficulty disturbing. (heh heh, Star Wars reference).If you've beaten Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass will easily tide you over. It's fun, not challenging and probably not the best Zelda recently but it's Zelda and that means enjoyable gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2007"}

With the easy-to-use PlayStation Move motion controller and PlayStation Eye anyone can crush, spike and smoke the competition in six challenging events that delivers the ultimate sports showdown.","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Excellent game to showcase the capabilities of the Move","reviewText":"The long wait is over and the verdict is in: Sports Champions for Sony Move is a winner.Sports Champions can either be purchased separately or bundled with the Playstation Eye and Move Controller. (I've left my thoughts on the Move under my review for thePlaystation Move Starter Bundle)I suspect that, as with Wii Sports, most people who get a Move will get it as part of the Starter Kit. But for those who are purchasing it separately, here's everything you need to know about the game.Before you start up the game, the system will calibrate the Move controller. You'll see an image of your room on the screen, and using augmented reality it'll draw a box around a region which you'll need to stand in throughout gameplay. The system will ask you to move your controller to your shoulders, to your side, and to your belt buckle.There are six sports to choose from. With each, you can select a tutorial (highly recommended) that talks you through how to play each game.Disc Golf: Here, you compete against each other or the CPU throwing a frisbee on a golf course trying to get to the target. The scenery is breathtaking. You'll stand on mountaintops, contend with lush forests, and more. Like a real frisbee, you can throw with as much or as little force as you need. You pick up the frisbee by holding the \"T\" button, and when you release the button it releases the frisbee. The controls are remarkably accurate, although it will take getting used to throwing without having the resistance of a real frisbee.Gladiator Duel: This is a game where you can choose to use one or two Move controllers. It's a heck of a lot more fun with two, as you can hold your sword in one hand and your shield in the other and control them independently (with one controller, you have to choose either the sword or the shield by pressing and holding the trigger button). Each time you block a move, it'll fill up a power meter that'll let you perform a combo attack. Again, the realism is phenomenal. As you fight your opponents, you'll see damage caused to their shelds and the surrounding arena (don't worry though, it's still rated E for everyone). You'll get a great full body workout from this one.Archery: This is another game where I'd say you need two Move controllers, so you can use one hand to hold the bow and the other to draw the arrow back (similar to Wii Sports Resort). With one Move controller, you're basically pointing and shooting, which is hardly realistic. Again, graphics are great--you feel like you're in the middle of Sherwood Forest.Beach Volleyball: Unlike the similar activity on EA Sports Active, this plays like actual volleyball. You have the option of using one or two Move controllers. The attention to detail is impressive. The system will move your player around the court, but for your part you have to us timing and technique to serve (underhand or overhand), bump, set, and spike. The tutorial is highly recommended, as you can learn how advanced techniques like tipping,  group blocking, and digging. Again, attention to detail is great with the blue ocean and the sound of the waves in the background.Bocce: If you don't know what Bocce is, think of the last time you watched Olympic curling. The rules are very similar. You throw a small ball (called a jack or a pallino) to set the target. Then, two players (or teams) compete to see who can throw their larger cannonball-sized balls closest to the jack (knocking opponent's balls away is possible). The game has been around since ancient times. The realism on the game too is astounding. You can play on different surfaces (on soil, on a pier, or on asphalt, with a beautiful city skyline in the background), and the balls react accordingly. To throw the ball, you hold down the Trigger and throw using an underarm motion just like you would the real thing. Letting go of the trigger releases the ball. By adjusting your wrist motion, you can even add spin to the ball.Table Tennis: I love playing ping-pong in real life, and I enjoyed playing it on Wii Sports Resort with the MotionPlus. But while playing it on the Wii was a lot of fun, I found that it wasn't the most realistic nor accurate game. I could easily beat the system by making exaggerated movements that didn't reflect real life, and the on-screen paddle didn't always mirror my real-life movements. With the Sony Move, you move the controller in your hand, and you see the exact same movement of your paddle on screen. You can use real-life movements to add topspin, backspin, and sidespin.The details of the game are amazing, and the game developers have a great sense of humor (One of the trophies you earn after playing Bocce is called \"I Have Heard of Bocce\". And there's a neat surprise waiting for you after you win your first Bronze Cup in the different events--I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say it's a nice look into the \"augmented reality\" that the Move is ushering in).Games have levels of beginner, intermediate, and advanced. But unlike other games, playing on the beginner level is definitely challenging and satisfying. Unlike other video games, the controls themselves are not \"dumbed down\" at beginner levels. Rather, the controls are the same at every level--it's just that at the beginner level you get more visual \"hints\" on how to perform your best and the opponents skills are also at a beginner level. So the game won't get old quickly, because as soon as you master the techniques and dominate at the beginner levels, you get to move on to stronger and stronger opponents and the visual hints start disappearing as you no longer need them.You might notice the word I keep repeating is \"realism\". One thing I appreciate is that Sony didn't just ape the Wii by copying its cartoony look and feel. Instead, the graphics are photorealistic and really show off the advanced graphics capabilities of the PS3. And while I was initially blown away by the \"coolness\" factor of the Move Controller, I quickly forgot about that as I immersed myself into actually playing the game--which is a good sign that Sony did its job. None of the games are exactly like the real thing, of course, but they all come closer than any other video game experience before.It's a great first effort for Sony, and hopefully indicative of things to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing.So the characters don't say much. It's mainly just a simple &quot;Yippee!&quot; or &quot;I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gonna win!,&quot; but there's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye. Sound effects are fine too. The soundtrack is excellent. It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz. Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great. You know Koji Kondo's doing something right hearing that.Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more.The game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64!

However when I played it one player I hated it. I thought it was too slow and real dodgy. But that was before I actually sat down and gave it a real go. And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better.To do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost. Once I had learned that it plays a lot faster.Overall, the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous SNES version. But it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version. But don't get me wrong, it is great for playing with friends, but it is a different feel from the original.In my opinion the best Mario Kart out is the GBA version because it is the SNES version with more tracks! (the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own.This version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons. They should have had more racers to choose from. And I miss my favourite driver the little Koopa Trooper, instead he's been taken out to make way for a slower Wario. But once I'd mastered that thing to take corners with, it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc.Overall, I give the one-player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4.Cons: Not enough tracks and courses. Once you've mastered the courses on 150cc, there is no further challenges for you in single player mode.- Not enough drivers to choose.- The sound effects can be very annoying after a while (like Toads Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa sound)- No way to turn the objects off (like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse... it is really unfair sometimes)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2005"}

This is one of the worst FPS games ever made.","reviewText":"This game is somewhat fun at times except for the special infected and how the game glitches you into getting grabbed by them no matter what you do, skill has no place in this game. The tank, hunter, boomer and esspessially the smoker. One hit is all it takes, it doesn't matter if you have full health, health packs, full ammo, super guns etc....one grab and your toast. Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights (if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight) and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating. Your whole group could be knocked down, not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games over....that is amazingly stupid. Why the hell can't your character fight back against these lame enemies?. The temp. invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame, it's a glitch maybe as this garbage game is obviously broken and unfinished but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them. The tank teleports threw walls, not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isn't enough and teleports to the top of staircases when your running away. Computer controlled Smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes, doors, and walls. Hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned. Skill is not required or achieveable in this game, they will get you every single time. When you get one shot you die due to the moronic AI players that stand there and watch you get lamed, it's maddening. The bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows, teleport through doors or walls, and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level. They also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot, they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots. I usually just gun them down and take their health packs when I need one, or they steal them using means beyond physics. The harder the difficulty the more useless they are. This game also has hovering molotov cocktails. If a horde is running at you and you throw one into it, the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding, ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by \"zombies\" taking damaged before the fire kills anything. I put zombies in quotes because these zombies don't eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks. Left 4 Dead also has bloodthursty fire, yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you, even sometimes when it's invisible it still damages you, maybe it's infected too? The DLC was a total joke and made Valve look tired and lazy. Survival mode sucks, you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game, a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die. Millions of Zombies, multiple hunters, multiple smokers, multiple tanks raining down on you until your dead.....wow so much fun to die in 1-3 mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you. The PC version actually has new campagins made by fans since Valve is too lazy to make them or even finish this glitched, poorly designed demo version mess. L4D II still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc. L4D ii was a major step down from l4d which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself. If you want a real zombie game Killing Floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and that's it. Also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in KF when you have full health you can go down fighting. In l4d you sit there crying for useless clepto AI players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills. This is a pathetic, retardedly glitched, broken, frustrating piece of garbage....trust me get Killing Floor. L4D 2 builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordes....it's virtually unplayable. L4D 2 is simply a 60 dollar update that should have been part of L4D 1 but valve saw fit to abandon L4D after 1 half assed tiny DLC patch with one new map.  This is my last valve game, I refuse to pay 60 bucks for a broken, demo beta version of games with no support which is what you get from valve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2009"}

Some games made a valiant attempt (Saint's Row?) but didn't quite match up to the overall greatness of GTA.  Enter Sleeping Dogs.  This game is pretty much a GTA clone in terms of gameplay.  It's a completely free roam game that offers plenty of side missions and main missions that you can play at your liesure.  You can carjack anyone, kill anyone, enter into heated police chases, shop for clothes, etc., just as you can in GTA.  The major differences are that rather than guns, grenades and baseball bats, your kung fu skills are your primary weapon.  That's not to say that there isn't any gun play in the game - there certainly is, and it's done relatively well - you will simply rely much more heavily on your fighting skills.  The battle mechanic is pretty well done and can be both fun and satisfying as well as frustrating. It feels very much like the fighting mechanic in Batman: Arkham City.  There is the added bonus of having the ability to use certain environmental \"kills\" when engaged in a fight, such as throwing a thug through a large aquarium or perhaps ramming his head into a phone booth.  I had a lot of fun beating down numerous enemies in this game.  However, I also experienced a fair amount of frustration.  As you progress in the game, you are tasked with taking on more and more enemies at a time, all with various degrees of ability.  On one mission, I found myself taking on three rounds of thugs at about 8 to 1 odds, some of them brandishing knives, some having a special grappling ability, and some being able to block just about everything you throw at them.  You have a very limited amount of health (unless you spend countless hours searching for hidden \"shrines\" that grant you increased overall health).  I can count a few times where I beat down 20 enemies just to get KO'd be the last remaining guy, resulting in me having to start all over again.  Annoying.  The gun play is solid and operates similar to Max Payne utilizing the \"bullet time\" option when needed.  My only complaint there is that the game needed more of it.  You aren't even allowed to carry a gun from one mission to the next.  I didn't care for that too much.  The story and voice acting are very well done (Hollywood stars were used such as Lucy Liu).  This is where I think the game actually gets the best of GTA.  The story really is top notch.All that being said, the game is very good but doesn't quite dethrone GTA as the champion of sandbox style games.  Perhaps a sequel with a little more gunplay will put it over the top.  I recommend picking this game up, as it's great fun.  It's already down to a $50 price point, so it's well worth a purchase.PROS- Nice visuals- Truly open world with a TON of extras, providing hours upon hours of gameplay- Fantastic story and voice acting- Good control scheme (driving vehicles is actually smoother than in GTA games)CONS- Not enough gun action- Fighting 20+ thugs at one time can get a little frustrating.

The first game's remake was a total masterpiece. Even though I still prefer the first version, the REmake (that's how I call it) is one of the best games in history. The Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis' ports were fine, I've already beaten those games before, but it was always good to buy them again for a very little graphical and sound update and for a trip down Memory Lane, if you know what I mean. Resident Evil Zero wasn't that good, I've expected much more, but the graphics were gorgeous. And now it comes the last game before the long-awaited Resident Evil 4... Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X.Yes, Code Veronica first appeared in the Sega DreamCast, it was a top-seller in that plataform. Soon, the X version, including some extras, and different things throughout the game, came for the PS2. Another Greatest Hit it was. The GameCube version of Code Veronica is much alike the PS2 version, but it has graphic updates and another different things that differ the GCN's version of the PS2's.The game soundtrack is fantastic. Not as good as the first game's, but it captures every room's spirit. Almost perfect, no complains. The voice acting is also a great thing, every character has its own style, from the eccentrical Alfred Ashford until the sweet Claire Redfield's voice, everything matches so well. Another score for CAPCOM! Graphically, the game isn't as good as Resident Evil Zero or Resident Evil, the remake, but it's almost there. The character's expressions are really good, even considering this game was originally released in 2000. Approved, graphically. The controls may be a little complicated for begginers, because even though this is a 3D game (yes, it feels great to play Resident Evil in a 3D universe, there aren't pre-rendered backgrounds anymore, like in every other game, it's now fully 3D, and it rocks!), you still must turn and walk, the controls are still almost the same from the other Resident Evil games, if you've played them, you'll get along very fine with this one. And, just a touch in the C Stick and your character turns 180 degrees, it's very helpful. Yes, once you beat this game, there are some extras... I don't want to spoil your surprises, but there are very nice things... This game is going to keep you amused for a while. Oh yes, I must also warn you that this game may be scary for younger children, so I'd recommend this game for 15 and up.So, my friends, to be ready for Resident Evil 4, you must play, beat and, even better, buy all the five Resident Evil games (REZero, REmake, RE2, RE3, RECVX) already released for the GameCube (they're all avaliable at Amazon.com), because they're all very worthy their prices. Resident Evil - Code: Veronica X is one of the best games ever, and you must play it to understand the whole series. Trust me, it'll be one of the greatest experiences ever in gaming universe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"A new era","reviewText":"Since the NES comics and video games have tried many times to come up with a game that is actually innovative and captures the magic of the comic its based on. Few have been able to and there have been some horrible examples in the past. Batman Arkham Asylum breaks this mold like a sledge hammer going through a piece of dry wall. In this game you feel like Batman, from the detective skills to the combat you feel immersed in the game. The story is great and the game play fits the story and style perfectly. I think it important to mention the design of the game because it captures Arkham with amazing detail. You feel like you are making your way into the heart of darkness, the design, the Gothic architecture, all blend to make a truly immersive game that somehow avoid feeling repetitive. Even when fighting multiple armed foes you feel like the bad ass you are as Batman. The boss battles are great and well laid out. The only disappointment is the ended, I won't ruin it but I think it could have ended much better.

However, I kinda ignored the voice in the back of my head, and decided to get the game anyway. When the 'more of the same' reviews started coming in, I wasn't disappointed; I loved the original game enough not to mind going through a very similar the game again (I played through Bioshock two or three times; each time finding something new in the game, or the story).The beginning of Bioshock 2 seemed promising. It's certainly impossible to top the beginning of BS1 (the whole segment up to the exit from the bathysphere is classic), but there was a lot of promise in the presentation of the new antagonist of the game, including the shrines you find here and there, and the occasional communist drivel she spouts. Once you reach near the end, however, you begin to realize that there's really not much of a twist in terms of a plot. The ending(s) is predictable, at best. In the grand scheme of things, Lamb is barely touched upon; enough to make you wonder why she was chosen as an antagonist. Many of the characters you meet in the game seem transient; the last conflict with Sinclair is almost laughable in its brevity and insignificance. In short, the story of Bioshock 2 doesn't hold a candle to that of the first game.On to gameplay.The Big Sisters, which seemed to hold so much promise before the game's release are nothing but another enemy - one almost impossible to beat without dying - at least early in the game on Medium and Hard. No real story is presented to explain their existence, short of a silly blurb about them being Little Sisters in a specialized suit.The underwater levels promised early on are nothing but brief stretches of linear path, and not deserving much mention.The Big Daddy drill is an interesting weapon in the new arsenal, but it lacks in two serious aspects: a) the drill dash is not available until later on in the game, and this move is often crucial for survival, and b) unlike the wrench, it requires \"ammunition\", which is often scarce to come by, especially on higher difficulty levels. You are pretty much guaranteed to drain the drill's ammo in any serious fight; therefore, you cannot depend on it in any medium- to large-scale fights.The variety of new weapons offered in the game is great, but you'll soon learn that you really need the drill, the shotgun, and the rocket launcher. The rivet gun becomes useless almost from the beginning - even headshots hardly scathe the opponents.The music! One of the best parts of Bioshock is the music, as it sets the mood perfectly. In Bioshock 2, music is barely heard in five or six locations throughout the game. I have heard more old-timey music waiting for the game to load, than I have throughout the entire game; making me wonder why 2K even bothered licensing the songs.That said, the game does make some good gameplay changes, including the spear gun, which is a fun weapon reminiscent of the one in Half-Life 2. Hacking is better, if not much more realistic, as now you need to hack as you play. While the underwater moments are all-too-brief, there are a few scenes which are beautiful and deserving a lot more attention, than that given. Another excellent addition was the view of the world through the eyes of a Little Sister - if you ever wondered why they refer to the splicers as 'angels', this part in the game makes the reason all-too clear.All said, I'm far more disappointed by the lack of a solid story in this game, than I am by the elements of gameplay. Living up to the original is not an easy task, and while I didn't expect the same level of innovation from this one, what I did get, I expected - a sequel that desperately cried out for the attention of the author of the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2010"}

If I may be so blunt, the first level was a turn-off to me.  I died over and over again, and sadly, I put the game away on my shelf...Until several months later, when I whipped it back out and decided it was time to take my strategy to the next level and try and master this game.  I made it past the first world, and became engrossed in the game's story and style of gameplay.The thing that people must understand about this game is that it is challenging beyond imagination.  You'll find yourself tearing out your hair at some points, and at other times you'll be fleeing from giant ice beasts that punish you for infiltrating their nest.  This game's action has no limits.  The first level was so hard to me because I was never used to this type of difficulty in a game; first levels of video games tend to be easy as pie, right?  That doesn't happen with Metroid Prime.  The game always challenges the player to no end, forcing you to bring out your true amount of skill.  That is one of the factors that makes this game an excellent one.Metroid Prime is a game that acts as a radar; it really shows you how good you are at games.  It is not one of those games where you aimlessly and carelessly shoot at enemies to win.  Heck no...Metroid Prime is a game based on enemy patterns, timing, and realizing where the foe's weak points are.  This game reveals to you your level of skill, like a long and hard test of bravery.  And it took me a long time to complete this test.  The final boss is one of my favorite in video game history; it took me about eight tries to beat it.  And the feeling after I won was one word: exhilarating.This was the first Metroid game I ever played.  It's also the most difficult one I've ever played, aside from the original Metroid.  But now I'll get into detail about what makes the game excellent.I've pretty much covered difficulty.  Now the story: Samus Aran has received a distress call from a Space Pirate Frigate; it seems that some specimens have broken loose.  And that's all I'm going to say; if you want to hear more in terms of plot, play the game or read the manual.Graphics: amazing.  Every boss is extremely detailed.  The environments look very natural.  You can see mountains, jungles, snow-covered lands, etc.  It's like you're in a virtual game.Sound effects: Blew me away completely.  There is a particular boss I remember that uses a shockwave-type attack with the most distinct sound: it sounds as if static electricity is spreading over a metal surface.Music: in the main world, there is peaceful music.  In boss fights, there is a unique track per boss.  Boss music tends to elevate a sense of excitement in the player while playing; imagine fighting a tough boss with fast-paced music.  It really raises the adrenaline.Gameplay: the game is extremely long, with many puzzles and dozens of different creatures to encounter.  I love exploring the vast environments in Metroid Prime.  Seeing lava serpents (called \"Magmoors\") pop out all of a sudden is so cool.  There are upgrades to collect, enemy data files to add to your log book, and strange artifacts to collect that show the path to the final stage.My conclusion: one of my favorite games of all time, even better than the Halo series, in my opinion.  It takes a serious amount of commitment to face the final boss and win.  It takes a lot of commitment to even get to that point.  But for beginners, let me tell you this: the first level seems tough and long, but once you complete that part, you will be thrown into an amazing world full of boss fights that make you shout with happiness once you kill them.  And who knows...you might unlock something really freaking cool when you beat the game. *HINT HINT*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2006"}

Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only the player's actions will determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil!

While Overlord does have a Pikmin influence in that you have minions you can control to do various tasks, the similarities pretty much stop there.First off, this game isn't \"cutesy\" like Pikmin is. This game is a full-on dark fantasy game full of demons, dark magic and a medieval setting. It definitely borrows a bit from The Lord Of The Rings when it comes to style, right down to \"halflings\" that live in little holes in the side of hills.The gameplay takes the Pikmin style of gameplay and builds on it. You can control numerous types of minions, and they themselves can be upgraded with sworda and armor they find themselves when you send them out to smash crates, treasure chests, pots and other things. They auto-equip them too, so you don't have to waste time maintaining each minion. I'm still early in the game, but if you use a bit of strategy, at least early on you can let your minions do almost all of the fighting. I'm sure that'll change as I get farther and the game gets harder. Where the game really starts to stray from Pikmin is that Overlord is just as much a true RPG and dungeon crawler as it is a \"god game\". You'll traverse lush forests, meet many characters, and battle your way through dungeons as you become more powerful and your minions become more numerous.The game also takes into account how evil your deeds are. If you kill innocents and bust up their houses and towns, they will act differently towards you. I have heard the mroe evil you play the better the game is, but I cannot confirm that.The game has a humor element too, and if you're into the dry British humor, you'll love the storyline and voice acting in this game. If you've played through the newer version of The Bard's Tale on PS2 or X Box, you'll sort of know the style of humor you'll find in Overlord.I have heard complaints in TV and magazine reviews that people wish the developers would have put a map in the game. You know what? I do too, but the graphics are so gorgeous that I don't mind wandering around,s laying sheep for the souls trying to find out where to go next. So far I've not had a single problem knwing where I should go next because another aspect of the game is that you, as an overlord, must build a destroyed castle that you are now calling your own. While out finding, you uncover waypoints that warp you to and from the castle. With this feature, it's hard to get too lost as you can always warp to the different waypoints from the castle.The castle is a whole other portion of the game too. As you build it up, other rooms become unlocked. In the beginning of the game you unlock a dungeon where you and your minions can practive fighting against all of the creatures you have fought so far. You get to keep the items and \"souls\" you find in there as well.I'm a bit shocked that this game ranks number 500 something on Amazon's top selling video game list. This game is THE funnest game I've played on the 360 so far. There's something inheritantly fun about sending off ultra-loyal creatures to loot, pillage, plunder and even kill themselves for you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"michael","summary":"great game","reviewText":"doom 3 is an awesome very scary game the graphics are the best i have ever seen in a video game it looks like a movie the story is like other doom games even if you dont like the doom series this is still a great game the gameplay is great the levels are so dark and of course you have to fight zombies demons and flying skulls which make it more scary then it already is and since you only start out with a pistol and flashlight it makes it very hard and scary and you always are alone in the dark with monsters creeping up on you which makes it even more scary i love this game it is the best horror game ever made BUY THIS GAME","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5DU","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"P. Sorornejad","summary":"Hard, Frustrating, Addictive, Amazing","reviewText":"Yep, the title of this review makes absolutely no sense right?  Well that's where the beauty of Dark Souls comes in.  My first introduction to this \"series\" was picking up Demon Souls for PS3 when it first came out.  There was very little hype behind that game, and I was a bit scared reading reviews of how hard the game was, and it was just that.  But wow, the feeling you get from beating those hard levels is indescribable, and this game is no different.  To start the review, let me list off a couple facts about Dark Souls:- Souls are a form of currency, and are used to purchase things and level up- Estus Flasks recover HP, and you start off with 5- Bonfires are where you save your game, heal, and restore estus flasks- Humanity is an indication of your human form, when you die, you lose humanity and turn Hollow- Hollowing prevents you from Kindling a bonfire- Weapons, Armor, and Accesories all contribute towards your equipment load, and can hinder your movement speed- Bonfires can be \"Kindled\" meaning they now can give you more Estus Flasks (10 during a standard Kindling). This can only happen with an extra humanity point, and only when you are not hollow- Bosses drop special souls, that can be either \"used\" to gain many soul points, or, saved and used to create special weapons- When in human form, you can summon other players into your game, or, be summoned into other games to help out- You cannot 'pause' the game, if you need to walk away, make sure there are no enemies around, or, sit at a bonfireDark Souls is really like no other RPG.  First, you are in complete control of character development, all of which is done through the gathering of Souls.  Souls, which also act as the currency in the game, are obtained through battles with enemies, but also can be found in random locations, or on dead bodies of fallen soldiers (where you get 'Soul[s] of a Brave Warrior', 'Soul[s] of a Hero', etc).  Once you obtain enough souls, it isn't as simple as pausing the game and clicking level up (a la Skyrim), instead, you must make your way to your save spot, known as a bonfire, to rest and level up.There is one caveat to that though, and is one of the most frustrating parts of the game, and that is if you die you lose all of your souls that you have in your possession (souls that had not been used to level up or purchase something).  You are then sent back to your last bonfire and must make your way back through the area you are currently in.  Now, the good thing is that you can get your lost souls back by making your way through and reaching the spot where you died last, but, die again before you get to your souls and they are gone forever!Already you are starting to see where the game has some \"gotchas\" and ways that it can really get you frustrated!  But this is the beauty of Dark Souls, and that is that no matter how many times you die, and how many times you need to retry an area, the sense of accomplishment is like no other.  You will soon find yourself putting 50-60-70 hours into the game and not realizing that much time has flied by as you are absolutely consumed.Now one thing that you will notice about the game is that there really is no in depth story, actually some will even argue that there is no story at all, but the beauty of the game is that as you play, you seem to forget about that, and almost not even care.  The game is rather addictive, which is something you do not really hear when discussing difficult games.Tips:- Honestly don't give up.  There are some areas where are just damn near impossible to beat, and that is done on purpose.  This isn't a game that you can just sit down and beat in a week, so please understand this before making the purchase.  There are some areas that will require you to go out and grind and grind and grind until your character is developed enough to withstand the obstacles ahead.- Use summons to your advantage! Dont be afraid to put a summon sign down and go into someone elses game and/or summon someone into your game.  It can be a big help as you now have a partner to help you gain some souls and defeat an area you are stuck in.- Don't go using Boss souls right away! You can use these souls to create powerful weapons and armor, and before you use them to gain souls, you should check to see what you can make and if you are interested in the item- Take your time! Dont just rush into the darkness, take your time, examine the area and always plan a way out just in case you encounter something that you are too weak to defeat.- On the verge of giving up?  Check out youtube for some great tutorials on how to clear certain areas.  Watching these videos will give you some pointers on how to advance through the area, or show you that your character isn't fully developed yet.Note:I really hope that my review helped open your eyes to this game, and hopefully you will give it a chance.  If you found this review useful, please mark it as such! If you find some discrepancies in my review, leave a comment and I will fix it right away.  Thanks, and enjoy the game!Edit ( 2/13 ) : I realized i didn't really make note of any CONs, so let me just list a few that I came across:1. The game tends to lag at times.  This is usually due to all of the stuff going on in the screen at once.  For example, if you have a big group of enemies that you are hack and slashing, and some start dying off, the game lags as it tries to create the animation of the death of the enemies.  Although it hasn't caused a huge problem or affected my gameplay much, it is something to note.2. If you are playing the game, and something happens to your Live connection, the game will exit to the main menu.  No big deal because when you load you game it will put you right were you left off, except if you are fighting a boss! I was fighting Seth the Scaleless and was halfway through the battle.  Started off with 15 flasks, and was kicking some serious butt.  He was at half health, and I had 8 flasks left.  Suddenly I see the \"Disconnected From Xbox Live\" pop up in the corner of the screen.  The game goes black, and a message comes up saying that the game is returning to main menu.  I crossed my fingers hoping that it would put me back right in the middle of battle to where I left off...... nope .... put me right at the \"white light\" before the battle, with only 8 flasks.  I entered the battle, and he had full health! ... not fun :(3. Falling death glitches.  This one has bugged me out so much!  There are times in the game when you will be fighting and the enemy has a strong attack that launches you back, notably the skeletons at the Firelink Shrine.  I got hit hard once and my character got launched back into some gravestones that you wouldn't normally be able to walk through.  I tried jumping out but couldn't clear some of the stones.  Next thing I know I fall through the ground and die.  This also happened to me in the Lost Izalith where i got stuck behind some branches of the trees that are in the lava.  After struggling to get loose, i eventually was able to jump out of being stuck.  For some reason though, when i jumped out and landed in the lava (no big deal because i had a certain ring equipped), it instantly killed me (i had full health).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007C72F2U","description":"","reviewerName":"H. N. T.","summary":"Better, but still behind Civ IV.","reviewText":"I loved Civilization from the first game.  I even tried Call to Power, but couldn't do it.Civ 5 clearly simplified too much, I must assume they wanted to increase the pontential number of players, but I don't see how the regular Civ 5 could please anyone.So now the idea is to introduce again Religion and Espionage into the game and (hopefully) some added complexity to the game. It does succeed at that, but at a much smaller level than the previous success of Civilization IV.Religion was made into an interesting innovation; you basically tailor your religion to your strategy by choosing which benefits it confers.  For example you can receive benefits for having the religion spread into different civilizations, or simply by the number of cities (your or others) affected, or the ability to buy building with the new faith points.  Pretty neat, and since a particular benefit can be interesting there is a sort of a race if two civilizations want to pursue the same strategy.The downside is that once the religions are established, there is little gameplay with them.  So they change the game from the beginning to say... 500 AD.  By them mostly everyone will have  a religion picked out.  It was a fine addition, but it mostly changed the early game in a relatively minor way.Espionage is the big let down.  It begins in the Renaissance (it is as if the game knew religion would be mostly played out by then) and you get one spy to try to steal tech or influence city-states.  Far too little gameplay and involvement, the spy doesn't exist on the map and it all happens in the \"Espionage screen\".  It is a cheap add on that does nothing to the game and is absurdly limited.  You get one new spy per age, so you can't move resources into more spies because basically they have very little to actually do.The greatest success is actually naval combat.  Now you have long range and melee ships, and you can attack cities more effectively with a navy. Naval combat was drastically improved with this.The new civs are irrelevant to me.  I don't care about new luxury items.  The foreign policy is very mildly different for city states, but the original one was practically broken, so I see this more as a patch than an effective expansion of the game.So this expansion is ok, but not worth the price.  It improves mildly Civ5, but it still is incredibly inferior to Civ4 in every way but graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}

FF7 is still best.First of all, many people complain about the battle system, in the beginiing I thought it was good but after a while it became lame, I like traditional battle system better, because the monsters are bigger! I'd describe it as 'real action turn based system.' The battle takes place in an real action fashion(i.e. Baulder's Gate, X-Men, Kingdom Hearts, etc...) with given orders as the turn based aspect. All enemies and characters have live action, you can hold lock-on button for a closer look or adjust camera angle to look up for a 'bigger than life' battle. You can assign Gambit or AI action to any character, the Gambit system works very well but kills the some joystick fun because you dont really control them anymore.The world of Ivalice is huge, beautiful, adventurous, open and very well designed. Monster design and variety are limited. The game always tells you where to go next, so no worrying about 'what do I do next?' The characters are pretty good but I wish there was one or two NON-human, hottie Fran is 'non-human' but she still looks human. How about a robot or alien!? The story is weak and boring, the cut-scenes depict personality of characters but fails to deliever it and along with the story development. The music is average, but it has a Final Fantasy feel. The ultimate finish move or 'Quickening' for characters looks awesome. The beast summons or 'Espers' are good but they are too small in size. It's time based(around couple minutes), this ruins the espers system, it should be until the esper dies. The license system is a bit daunting, you have to acquire 'license' to use anything, this system allows anyone to use any weapon/armor/magic/skill which is neat but an 'auto' system of some kind would be nice.This game have a high difficulty level.The graphic is awesome with full 360 degrees adjustable camera, a wonderful technical achievement for PS2! Make sure to turn off the 'flicker' option for a sharper graphic.Overall this game grinds to a halt after playing for 70%, Painfully I played until 80% or till I reached the entrance of the final dungeon. Then I didn't want to play anymore. This is a bad Final Fantasy game, mainly due to battle system, story and character development issues.

{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"A very enthusiastic review from a non-ethusiast of fighting games","reviewText":"I usually don't like, play, much less purchase fighting games. The last two fighting games I bought were Tekken 4 and Soul Calibur II, and of course, I bought them because they were pre-owned. Before that, I had bought at one point Mortal Kombat 1-3 for Genesis, and for some mysterious reason ( I can't remember right now how I got them) I had Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Samurai Showdown. I have never liked playing fighting games at the arcades.If the picture isn't clear enough yet, fighting games are NOT my thing. At all. I usually suck at them, I usually can't figure how to perform any tricks or finishing moves, and quite honestly, they bore me. Notwithstanding, a while ago I had SF II HD Remix in front of me, and a need for brainless, reaction-induced fun rekindled a long lost nostalgia in me. I was hooked. I usually go for story heavy games, but sometimes you need to zone out, or zen in, and SFII did that for me. So, with the upcoming release of this little jewel right here, I was quite enthused. And I was delightfully surprised. Just the sheer fun factor of this game is well worth the sticker price.  The new aesthetic is odd at first, but it manages to keep within the realm of the beloved home brand. And it's just downright beautiful. I didn't dig much the anime intros, but that didn't detract from the overall experience for me. The music is a nice rockin' soundtrack you'd expect from Capcom. The sounds are pretty much a great evolution from the classic hadokens and shoryukens and whatnot. I haven't followed the series much, so I don't know how much the gameplay has evolved, but I am having loads of fun so far.What struck me most about this title is the ability it has to make me feel as if I was playing it at the arcades, which I think has been the Holy Grail of fighting video games: to replicate the arcade experience. And although games look,feel and sound phenomenal nowadays, you don't always get that over-the-top, larger-than-life feeling from a fighting game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"faster \"dressed in black\"","summary":"A great deal and super sexy","reviewText":"The price may seem expensive but considering you are getting a handheld state of the art gaming console, mp3 player, movie player, picture viewer, and eventually an internet browser the price is very good.

{"product_name":"B002I0IIPY","description":"","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"Excellent from beginning to end.","reviewText":"I've not finished this game 100%, but I did play enough to warrant a good review.  I've gone up to the ending of the game, but haven't collected all red rings, or obtained an S rating (the highest) in all the levels.But after playing this game, I'm totally looking forward to the future of Sonic.  I've played a few 3D Sonic games (Sonic Adventure, Sonic Heroes), but I grew up with Sonic by playing Sonic Chaos and Sonic Triple Trouble on the Game Gear, and played a lot of the Genesis titles found in the Sonic Mega Collection for the PS2.So I'm a big Sonic fan.After renting Sonic Unleashed, I found that, as with many gamers, I was looking forward to the day levels more than anything else.  Don't get me wrong: the night levels were fine, but it wasn't a Sonic game.  And Sonic isn't just about speed, but proper platforming.  The Game Gear games I used to play had me figuring out where the the end was, and how to get there the quickest.  There were a lot of puzzles than just getting to the end the fastest, and this is where Sonic Colors makes its debut.They take the best of the Genesis titles (proper puzzles, speed) and integrate them with the lush 3D environments.  Despite how abysmal previous Sonic games have been this century, they were amazingly great with the visuals, and this title is no exception.  It provides a great ideal of goin' fast, but also stops you to figure out the level design as in the days afore.The levels, however, re really short, and the game is overall brief.  Some levels seem more like bonus levels, and a few times I thought, \"That was it?  That was the whole level?!\"  Granted, there are about 6 acts in each world, but still.  (Super Mario Galaxy /2 has some short levels, but none as to-the-point as Sonic Colors).Now, for some gripes.CONSSome levels are too short, as mentioned before.  You get to the end real quick without even realizing it.  There are no cheap deaths, though, that I've encountered; so long as you pay attention to the environments, you really can't go wrong.The end does get pretty difficult, but that's a given.  The deeper you go into the game, the harder it should be.The controls aren't as tight as I'd like them.  They're fine for the game, but sometimes I wish the double-jump and wall-jump were utilized better.Confusing controls.  In some games you can't map the buttons, but they work fine.  In this game, however, I kept confusing the dash and slam buttons, which shouldn't happen.  I got used to them, but I should be able to switch 'em out.SUPER CHEESY dialog.  The story was a lot better than I thought it would, but there were times when I (a 24-year-old gamer) got a little embarrassed about the game I was playing.  Some may argue it's reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons--but I dunnah know....There were a lot of \"watch the game\" moments.  There should be a little signal showing when you're not actually playing, because by actually pressing buttons instead of letting the game take over, I would die.PROSExcellent Wisp implementation.  I'd love to see more, but the way this game used Wisps was very well done.  There were some that were a little difficult to pull off (laser), but they were fine in general.SPEED!  Sonic is REALLY fast!  I miss the rolling dash move (hear me, Sega?), but the homing attack is very useful.  The environments greatly pave a way for super-fast Sonic, and when he stops, it smoothly transitions me into figuring out the stage design.Despite the short levels and extremely easy bosses, the final boss makes up for it (no spoiler).Also, despite my complaint about mapping buttons, you can use a wide array of controllers at your disposal: the Wii Remote sideways, the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo, the GameCube controller, and--my personal favorite--the Classic Controller /Pro.The game is a necessary part of your Wii library.  It's no Super Mario Galaxies, but the fact that people are even mentioning such an astronomical title (pun intended) with Sonic Colors just shows how much the game has to offer.  I don't recommend it for the younger crowd as it can be a bit frustrating and difficult, but for gamers in general and those skeptical about the Sonic franchise, I'd say without hesitation that Sonic is back.  It's not the greatest game the Wii has to offer, but it's definitely the right foundation for the future of Sonic.Here's hoping the blue blur shows his stuff in later installments.tl;dr version:PROS:- great visuals- amazing Wisp implementation- very fast- no cheap deaths if you pay attention to the environmentCONS:- somewhat clunky controls- super cheesy dialog- short- easy bosses (at first)A great and necessary addition to your Wii library, and aptly paves the road for the future of 3D Sonic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

Overshadowed by his rotund brother, Luigi has accepted Miyamoto's brace on a reputable spot for the GameCube.  Despite the fact that the green plumber lacks the highest of the high eminence when compared to his counterpart`s Super Mario World and Mario 64, Luigi's Mansion sends the player on one of the topmost experiences a game can frankly provide.  Although it does not live up to the demoralizing hopes for a weekly played platformer, Luigi's new 2D-like dance is incredible in all its rights.  Conversely, not taking the vital steps as a boundless platformer, Luigi's Mansion has one sticky, discernible shortcoming.  Spanning only and about six hours, the game will be a mixture of being awestruck or deeply saddened for those rummaging for a clear-cut Mario sequel.Luigi's Mansion lobs the player as Luigi, a spineless Ghostbuster.  Armed with a flashlight, the Hoover (a vacuum cleaner), and a Game Boy Horror (which serves as a  map), the mildly brave Luigi must investigate a haunted Mansion where each corner and crevice must be thoroughly searched for interleaving puzzles.  The puzzles work as a chain of sequence throughout the game, marking advancement into the vast halls.  Each room, gushing with several hordes of terrorizing ghouls, must be explored in order to attain keys where entry is denied.  The regular, constant ghosts found to and fro the game are vanquished easily.  By screening the flashlight on a ghoul, a significant number of HP will appear, and the player must completely nullify that number.  Operating the Hoover, Luigi will be thrown left and right while the skirmishing ghost endeavors not to be sucked into oblivion.  Gradually, its HP will melt down, reaching 0 and finally being bagged.  Sounds very simple, no?  Well, soon the rules are altered as new, nastier, and more technique-employed ghosts come screeching down the halls.  If the player is stomped on how to thrash a certain ghost, simply utilizing the Game Boy Horror will force the phantom to discharge a hint on ripping them apart.  Other ghosts, intent on not letting the player see them, unveil themselves once Luigi carries out particular tasks.  Subsequently, Luigi goes face to face with immense bosses that require different tactics to slaughter.  On the dot, Luigi's Mansion keeps and repeats this gameplay pattern., not really making up for its abrupt conclusion and obvious repetitiveness.On the graphical standpoint, this is beyond what other previous consoles have come close to imitate.  Remembering when the PlayStation tried to encapsulate fitting cartoony looks, the GameCube scoffs at all preceding efforts, pulling off the greatest type of cartoon visuals ever.  Running at 30 frames per second, making use of spotless lighting, shadow, and transparency effects, Luigi's Mansion will have any kid ditch the teletubbies, and glue their faces onto the pulsating gaming screen.  Luigi has a original collection of facial expressions.  Moving gracefully, without any slowdown, the player and his surroundings are planed in a radiance of lightly colored backgrounds and an overwhelming number of illumination effects.  Just the little threads of detail in the game give a hint on how future GameCube titles will be furnished around dazzling tapestries.  As if to counter this pro, the musical soundtrack are rather lackluster and utterly uninspiring.  While the game's many sounds (Luigi humming to himself) and all the other jingles are up-to-the-par with quality, the redundant music recurs over and over and over. . .Even though my gaming hunger for the next Mario platform is months away (Mario Sunshine), Luigi's Mansion proves to be a wistful frolic until the ornate mind of Miyamoto breaks all the gaming rules yet again.  Lavishing some good innovation, save for the succinctness on the hours, the game is a demanding buy, but well worth a revisit on the all-star plumbers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2001"}
{"product_name":"B007V6MQR6","description":"","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"An action-packed futuristic third-person shooter","reviewText":"Developed by Devil's Details/Yakuza Studios and published in April of 2012 by Sega, \"Binary Domain\" is a third-person team based shooter set in Tokyo, Japan circa 2080. Global Warming has caused worldwide flooding leaving millions dead and three fourths of the planet underwater and uninhabitable.  In order to combat the loss of humanity and aid in the rebuilding of societies robots are created.  Unfortunately, not all robots are being created for labor and numerous experimental artificial intelligence models violate international laws, requiring termination. The player assumes the role of Sergeant Dan Marshall, a young spec-ops soldier who leads a team called a \"Rust Crew\" who specialize in eliminating \"Hollow Children\" (banned robots that are able to pass as humans).  You and your team are sent to Japan under the orders of the United Nations to apprehend the suspected creator of the Hollow Children.  Here are my thoughts on Binary Domain;Pros+ Fantastic graphics, especially the bosses, character models and facial expressions.+ Fast paced and fluid gameplay and gun combat.+ Epic boss battles.+ Non-stop action.+ Intriguing story.+ Varied sequences (boating, driving etc.) kept the game interesting and fresh.+ Can activate on Steam.+ Able to take down enemies by shooting off limbs (much like Deadspace).Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Some really terrible and repetitive dialogue.  Japanese doesn't always translate well to English.  The character of \"Big Bo\" was by far the worst offender with his constant use of \"aight and bro.\"  Ugh.- Stupid AI constantly runs in front of you while you're firing and then proceeds to chew you out for shooting them.- Cut scenes stuttered from time to time.- Use of the spacebar for sprinting/tumbling/cover was troublesome at times if you were too close to objects that provided cover.- No real character choices that could change the outcome of the game.- Characters were very slow to recover after a knockdown/resuscitation.  Often you would go down immediately after being revived as the enemy would just stomp you again.- Game ending was predictable and the final boss fight was lackluster compared to other bosses you encountered throughout the story.- Character movement while climbing ladders was stiff and jerky.- NPC movements can be glitchy, especially when they're next to each other.- Teammates constantly yell at you (Over here! Follow me!) when you're trying to explore to find collectables and ammo.  This gets to be a bit annoying.- Bosses have no health bars and at times it's difficult to tell if you're damaging them or wasting ammo.  I learned that if you see blue sparks/lightning when you're firing at them then they're taking damage.- Some characters are not available to select for your team at times.  This can be bothersome if you just spent a lot of credits upgrading their skills rather than your own.- Some poor water/rain effects early in the game.- Story can be a tad too predictable at times.- Shallow team \"trust\" based system.- Lacks depth for character/weapon customization.- Stereotypical characters.- Requires use of Steam.- Linear gameplay.- Checkpoint save system.- No crouch option.- Console port.- Too short.Despite a lengthy list of Cons (mostly minor), \"Binary Domain\" was a relatively short but extremely entertaining action filled shooter.  Filled with challenging and fun gigantic robot boss fights and a storyline that keeps you playing, Binary Domain was well worth the play through.  The level designs, while linear are varied enough that the game always has a fresh approach as you progress.  Unfortunately, it's easy to be put off in the early levels of the game because of the incredibly annoying teammate (Big Bo) you start with.  Luckily you're able to swap him out after you meeting up with the rest of your team in the beginning.  I should mention that I purchased this game during Amazon's Summer Sale for only $9.99 and for the 13 hours of gameplay it provided me I felt it was well worth the purchase price.  If I had paid the full MSRP price of $39.99 I might have been a bit more disappointed in its short length.  That being said I'd definitely recommend Binary Domain to anyone looking for an entertaining team based robot shoot'em up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2012"}

Richardson","summary":"A fun, flawed budget title for the 3DS","reviewText":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars is a fun shooter strategy game. Customization aspects are limited for your units, as you can't change classes or really do much of anything in terms of customization except deciding between similar pieces of equipment for your guys. Classes themselves differ mostly in terms of their equipment, although these allows enough variation to be satisfying. Most of the classes (sniper, medic, heavy weapons guy, etc.) are are fairly balanced, but there is at least one class (assassin) that is so overpowered that it takes away most of this title's difficulty.In fact, most of the difficulty in this title is artificially imposed by time limits and such, although when enemy units are gunning for your weakest team member, it can add to the challenge (one universal fail condition for any of these missions is if any of your guys die). I recommend only playing on hard mode, as normal mode poses no challenge whatsoever.The multiplayer for this game is awful. There isn't even any typical local play. No download play either. You have to pass THE SAME 3DS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PEOPLE when you want to play multi-player! This is so insulting that I wish they would have just integrated the so-called \"multi-player\" missions into the single-player campaign.The game's cut-scenes are atrocious when they try to show any kind of actual animation, which is why the game mercifully limits most of the cut-scenes to dialogue boxes between different characters.Story-wise, this is mostly uninvolving. It involves an attempted take-over of the Russian government by a cabal of ultra-nationalists who wish to unseat the current, more democratic administration in power by instigating trouble in neighboring countries. It's okay, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. The characters are flat and stereotypical, but this didn't bother me too much.With all of that out of the way, I'd like to note what the game does right: quite a bit, actually! The 3D effect is hit-and-miss at times, but it can add a lot of depth to the battlefield, so I usually play this with the 3D enabled. Atmospheric effects are actually pretty good, although they can kill the frame-rate at times. The single-player content is quite a bit of fun. The gameplay mechanics themselves are very tight. Gameplay style is actually unusually varied for this genre of game, which I was definitely happy to see. The main campaign is of a decent length, and then there are extra \"skirmish\" missions on the side that mix things up a bit. I had a lot of fun with the single-player side of things.Overall, I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this, but as an under-$30 title, this is a great value for strategy fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2012"}

And personally, as a girl gamer, I'll be the first to admit, that stuffs just TOO HARD for me, I LOVE the PUZZLES, and slower moving of it, cause when shit gets TOO HARD, I hand the controls off to my boyfriend or son to beat the bossman (after I try and die several rounds mind you) and I go back to my game.  The newer games just got TOO HARD for me.  So when my bf and our friends got me a 3DS for my birthday with Revelations, I was nervous it would be too hard as all the recent RE have been, but yay!  It is like going back to the Mansion, but on a boat!  Literally.  Only with new zombie-creatures, new plot-twists and story developments, more to sink your teeth into.  And it's hard as hell sometimes, as expected, I still have to have help on the stupid bosses... So everyone wins, right?  I have my puzzles, and I was so thrilled to get to push stuff around again!  And in a hurry, too, because stuff is coming for me!  Back are the days of zombie nightmares!  (NO other video game has EVER given me nightmares!) I love my Resident Evil for this!  And another plus that I love with this newer edition, the back and forth between the two teams, the team on the boat and the team on the beach coming to rescue the team on the boat.  Always with new plot developments, mind you.  Amazing stuff.  It's like being on the Titantic, but with Zombies!  Braaaiiinnnssss!  Nom Nom Nom!  Highly Recommended to all!  If you love the older style Resident Evil like me, you'll love this!  Must have!  Wish they were ALL made like this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2012"}

So I went into this game blind not knowing much except what the first teaser trailer showed. But having played it I have to be honest its my least favorite game of the series. I'll explain pros and cons with detail.>PROS-&lt;-Gorgeous graphics and superb lighting the best in the series no doubt.-Detailed enviroments they all look and feel alive.-Lots of challenges to complete.-Its a lengthy game if you take your time.-Very good voice acting as always.-Instincts is cool to use.-Contracts mode is a cool bonus.-Great situational music.>CONS-&lt;-There's no map,which means less strategy and even more trial and error.-Too many scripted AI's, predictability in later playthroughs.-Disguise don't always work, especially in the higher difficulties.-You don't have any options when it comes to weapon choices, whatever you find is what you can take.-Weapons don't carry over to the next part of the level even though the whole level is in one general area.-There's no quick saves.-Checkpoint system is flawed, meaning every enemy respawns yes even the ones you've killed.-End level upgrades are barely noticeable.-HUD is annoying if you don't care about scoring,you'll constantly see negatives for doing normal things you'd expect to do in previous games or stealth games in general like knocking out a enemy still gives you a negative.-Heavy emphasis on set pieces.-Linear levels, the most in the series.-Instincts was a bad idea and does't go well with the disguise mechanic.-Faceless targets,your given targets to kill with no backstory as to who they are or why they should be killed aside from the ones that appear in cutscenes.-Conclusion--The game is not bad but its missing a lot of things that the previous games had and in that feels stripped down in the end. The game doesn't look like it will have a lot of replay value as I mentioned the levels are linear which means less options, there are a few levels that are big but the linear ones outway the bigger levels. Contract mode is neat but unless you have a bunch of friends playing and are really into the whole game as a hardcore fanatic you probably won't play it often.Absolution is still a entertaining game if you don't compare it to the previous games in the series but if you've played the previous hitman games and find yourself disappointed with this one I don't blame you. I went into the game blind and ignoring all the negative pre-conceptions that followed before the game released but yet I find myself dissapointed with the game after playing it. If you want it wait for a price drop or rent it. I payed $38 by using coupons and I feel it was worth it but truthfully I think I should of waited and bought the HD trilogy instead and then finally buy it later. Anyway enjoy the game for what it is I suppose, and do check out the HD trilogy when it releases, I know I will.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"The Nintendo that didn't have a fair go","reviewText":"Nintendo will never be out-done, just out-priced.Nintendo started off making small hand held electroic games before creating the 8 bit system in the 80's. And when they released the Super Nes they had the 2 greatest home video game systems of the day. Sega never stood a chance because they rushed things just to compete with nintendo, where as nintendo took there time when releasing systems to make sure they where the best they could be. Only the people whose mothers bought them a Sega instead of a NES or SNES where the ones who would defend the Sega systems. But the segas where slow, graphics wernt as good and the sound was as bad as the game play handling.Nintendo had completly beaton Sega in the market of games. But sega brought out an attachment for the Genises/Mega drive that allowed you to hook on a CD ROM drive to the machine. And nintendo decided to make an even better one to attach to the SNES. If you look on the bottom of a SNES console, you will see where it would attach. The CD Rom for SNES was being developed by Nintendo and Sony. But arguments arose between Sony and Nintendo and Sony seperated themselves from Nintendo and went solo on the project that eventualy became the Playstation!The playstation was only twice as powerfull as the SNES. The snes was 16 bit, the PS was 32 bit. So ninetendo developed a 64 bit system, twice as powerfull as the playstaion, better graphics, better controll, and better potentiol.But when the 64 was released, it did not get the fair attention it should have. Why? Because of the CD's Sony used. Not because they where better, not because they where slower, not because they where more fun...no... it was because people where buying them ripped / copied / burnt / bootlegged for a small price. And this still goes on today. That was the biggest reason why Sony was having more succsess then nintendo. Because those CD rom games where able to be copied and the cartridge of the nintendo was not.The PS games only surpassed with slightly better sound, the 64 could play high quality sound, but it was up the games developer on wether or not to use up space on the game with sound or not. That is about the only advantage the PS had, sound, particuly just music. Some people say the controllers of the PS where better then the N64, but I preffer the 64, it did take some time to adjust to it, but that is personaly taste rather then anything.The nintendo 64 suffered a blow when more game developers wouldnt make games for the 64 anymore because it was easier to put them on a CD and develop them that way, then to program them for cartridges. So, that is not nintendos fault, that is the game developers fault for being lazy and just wanting to make quick games instead of decent and good games.Nintendos team called RARE where the ones who always pushed the boundry on games. Just like they did with Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, they broke new ground by not just using the full potintiol of the system, but by finding ways to go beyond it's full capabilty! They released one of the best games on the 64 called \"Golden Eye\". The James Bond game was the 1st to use the full potentioal of the 64's capability. The game is amazing and still hard to beat by todays standards. The game did not even need the expansion pack the 64 soon offered.The best games where coming from the game developers who put the effort into making the great games, and the playstaion never had anything as fun to play as the 64 offered. The graphics where so much smoother, the game play was so much more responsive and the fun was there. One of the first games I compared was WWF ATTITUDE. And pretty much like I said, the PS version took longer to load, wasnt as responsive, the graphics where horriblly blocky, and the only thing that was better was it had more sounds from the commentators. And maybe some of the entrance themes where longer. But apart from that, nothing (maybe video footage) but that was never apart of what you where playing which is what counted and the PS was the thumbs down, but because of people able to buy copied games, the PS became popular that new comers to the sytem THOUGHT it was the better system. It isnt.These days the battle goes on between Nintendo, Sony & Microsoft. But I know for sure, Nintendo will always supply quality games, games worth playing, games using full potentiol of the systems capability, and most important...respect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Alex","summary":"Fell in love with this game right away","reviewText":"This game is great for all ages.

LIke several of other Tom Clancy's games, STEALTH is the operative word.  True, you do have some freedom in blasting away any moving thing. but the freedom is not to be utilised in every and any situation.  The details of Sam Fisher is absolutely fantastic, down to the circuit for his wetsuit.  I have yet to describe the environments.  In the first mission, Sam encounters a burning apartment complex, and exploring it is quite fantastic with the glows and embers of the fire flying every which way.  The patrols are much more realistic than in Metal Gear Solid, and they actually wear different suits and have different statures and facial features.Now about Sam Fisher.  He does a split jump to keep above enemies, able to hang, zip, and dangle and has some of the coolest gear out there.  The fiber optic camera for use beneath doors is awesome. He has the abillity to interrogate captured persons and utilise them as body shields when necessary.  Also, the voiceover for Sam Fisher  is great.My one and only criticism regarding the game is that Sam should have a first-person view for much better head-shots, particularly in intense situations.Other than that, the game is exceptional for the XBox, and it is must-buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2002"}

Story-wise, FFX-2 actually elected to discard all of the elements of maturity while keeping all of the elements of immaturity. Paine's character is PAINEfully underdeveloped, for which there is no excuse in a 128-bit game with only three playable characters. This game is the only one in the series with poor music, which is campy and repetitive, with the exception of the two vocal J-POP songs, which are decent. The animation of the 3-D models is also noticeably uninspired in this game, with many NPCs engaging in unrealistic and irritating animation loops.Despite having a weak story and poor music, this is still a good game, and probably the best in the series in terms of diversity of play. Less time is spent battling in this game than any other in the FF series, and more of that time is spent playing mini-games. Rather than having field screens be bland paths seperating towns, there are many things in each environment to interact with. 'Hanging out,' in the world of FFX-2 is fun at times, but the poor overall presentation of the game keeps the player from wanting to do too much of it. Although FFX-2's battle system is slightly worse than FFX's overall, the battles in FFX-2 can be fun, with the combination of FFX's battle camera and ATB. Re-working ATB to consider the position of enemies, and giving the characters the ability to delay enemy attacks by hitting them at the right time, was a good idea, but the variety of mechanically-unique battle scenarios in the game wasn't sufficient to encourage players to actually formulate tactics around this mechanic.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

This is simply because any concentrated effort to play 'all' of an RPG that is so large it is almost unwieldy surfaces all the little irritating quirks that almost have to be there in a game of that genre.  Secondly, I wasn't sure whether I would immediately replay it or not.FFX-2 is a derivative of FFX, both taking place in the same world, with many of the characters that FFX made famous.  Kimahri discovers an ancient holographic sphere on the heights of Mt. Gagazet.  In it Yuna sees the face of someone she thought was gone forever - Tidus - appears in an artifact that is centuries old.  This awakens Yuna from inactivity, and she joins Rikku and a new friend, Paine, to become sphere hunters.  They seek both treasure and knowledge.From these beginnings a massive tale begins to spring.  Sphere hunters compete, opposed factions on a Spira move towards war, and a tormented spirit from the far past threatens to completely undo what Tidus and Yuna sacrificed so much for.  And I do mean massive.  You will ride the good airship (kind of a giant flying Harley) on quest after quest.  The world shares topography with the Spira of old, but it ranges far deeper.  And countless side quests fill out your journey.If it is really that good, why did I hesitate?  Mostly because the game comes impossibly close to being too big.  Nothing is impossible with sufficient leveling up, but the price of leveling up is having to endure some player control features that can irritate after a time.  A huge number of side quests mean too many senior moments when you discover you forgot to do something important.But the truth is that this is certainly the best RPG of 2003, and could very well simply the best game for the year.  Artwork and cut scenes are wonderful, the changing costumes that reflect the powers that the Yuna and the other Seagulls, and the creatures - friendly, boss, and otherwise - all this contributes to the final effect.  A touching and human story and magnificent music complete the grand scheme.  Square Enix felt they had to outdo all their previous efforts, and they did exactly that.If you haven't played FFX you will find that this game is completely playable without it.  The story stands on its own.  Of course, if you have played FFX, you have some idea of what is coming.  Overall this gets top grades, and will have a share of the crown for some time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2003"}

Exploring/roaming is also cool.- Climbing/jumping on buildings is very fun and easy to control.- Finding the various hidden flags is a nice touch, but there are so many!- Climbing the viewpoints is always fun and the views on top are incredible. I also like the swan dive you take off the top of the viewpoint.- Good sound effects and a decent musical score.The Bad:- Mission design is very repetitive. You essentially do the same thing for each mission... a little investigation, then an assassination. It gets old.- Guard/alert system is tedious. It is very frustrated to \"blend in\" every time you walk past a guard.- Controls are overly confusing. Try holding \"blend in\" while walking and trying to look up at a guard on a building. I don't have three hands, so why do I need that many to perform this simple task. Perhaps \"blend\" shouldn't be a push and hold control. The fighting controls also get tiresome. The climbing controls, while easy, don't always work as anticipated. Sometimes instead of scaling a wall, you bounce backwards right into the guards you're trying to escape.- Stealth aspect of the game is underdeveloped. You can't hide behind objects, peak around walls or even crouch down. But, you can jump in a bail of hay, and that loses the guards... right. You can also sneak up on guards, but again it just feels underdeveloped. Perhaps they should have referenced Metal Gear Solid if they wanted to do stealth right.- The cut scenes after an assassination are silly, and they are all so similar. The cut scenes with the head assassin (old guy in robe) are also silly and much too wordy.- After picking up a flag, the screen twinkles with DNA effects, which is pretty, but it essentially makes you blind for 2-3 seconds... not good when escaping guards.- I have gotten an error \"Disk is scratched or dirty\" a few times when trying to leave the assassin's bureau. The disk is perfect... it's a glitch.- Some graphical \"pop in\", especially when running or riding horse. Entire crowds of people just pop into the screen. Unacceptable for a PS3 game.- Weapon choices are limited. A sword, some throwing knifes, and a smaller sword, that's about it.Overall this game is a cool concept, but it falls short in the key areas of gameplay, control layout and mission design.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}

This is the sequel to the sleeper hit, Mercenaries (mercs) that came out with the last gen consoles near the end of their popularity. A lot of its fans claim that the first game was better, but I have to disagree. Also you should be aware that this game is ARCADEY, this is not a realistic game! This is not a simulation like GRAW or RS6 or COD.In Mercenaries, you can pick from three different character mercenaries (mercs) and they each have a unique advantage over the other characters: Mattias, can regenerate health faster than the others, Chris can carry more ammunitions, and Jen can run faster on foot than the others. The storyline, missions and the game's ending however, remains the same for all of the characters regardless of whom you choose to play as.The story is one of its weakest points, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. In the previous Mercs game your character drowned if they went into the water, you couldn't pilot boats and trees were indestructible and impassable. In this sequel, your character can swim on water and even pilot all types of boats! Trees and bushes can be destroyed and are passable with any land vehicle. These are minor improvements but they make the open world experience more enjoyable.The game is open world which means you can go just about anywhere and do about anything you want. You can choose to play campaign missions or side missions by going to any faction that is friendly towards you. The factions are: Universal Petroleum (UP),Venenzuel (VZ), Pirates, PLAV and VZ (whom are always hostile), Allied Nations (AN) and Chinease also become available later into the game.Aside from doing side missions for friendly factions, you can buy weapons from them by going to their shop. You can also take weapons from dead friendlies or enemies that drop them to the ground. There are also bombs and airstrikes which can be found through out the world map (they have unlimited respawns for free!) You can buy vehicles at the shop too, but you also have the option to hi-jack any vehicle in the game; as long as you don't anger a friendly faction.The number of varied vehicles and weapons is enourmous! All the standard stuff are there such as: smgs, rpgs, c4, lmg, grenades, but the airstrikes and the destruction they cause are a sight to behold! Buildings crumble, walls break down, vehicles demolish all in a blaze fire and dust. The explosions and destruction that you can cause is amazing. And best of all you can play co-operatively online with another person!What are the bad points of the game? The game has a lot of little glitches offline, such as floating objects and stupid AI. The major gameplay glitches seem to occur online co-op play which is kind of bad but do not occur all of the time. Hopefully the game's developer will fix these issues with patches. The graphics and animations look like a last gen game and need to be update for a nextgen title.Aside from the glitches, If you like open world gameplay, third person shooters or arcadey gameplay, I do recommend Mercenaries 2 though I think there is lots of room for improvements in the future.Pros:+open world gameplay+two player co-op+destroy just about anything+great explosions+best airstrikes in video game+lots of weapons+lots of vehicles+you can swim and pilot boats+hijack any vehicle+cool side missions+campy humorCons:-cannot fly planes-lots of glitches-no customizable characters-no multiplayer-last gen graphics-weak story-short campaign","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2008"}

I love the story line, although a bit confusing since our hero isn't really aligned with Assassins or Templars initially. I also find the setting to be much more fun than the previous games. Not to detract from previous games, they're all 5 star, but this is the best in my humble opinion. Sailing the Caribbean under the Black Flag, exploring the various ports, harpooning hammerhead sharks, fighting Spanish and English ships, it's all good fun. Game play is the familiar AC style so there are no new moves to learn although the shipboard commands are somewhat new but not greatly different from AC III, just some new armament. Ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore battles are too cool. So, that's my take on it. Figure it out for yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Chad E. Munn","summary":"This is NOT a console game. This is NOT your kids RPG.","reviewText":"I'm a 40 yr old gamer with about 22 years of gaming under his belt. I've been a D&D; table top gamer for almost 18 years. This is the first time those two worlds have come together.Witcher 2 is THE single best game I've ever played in my life. Period. It ruins every medieval themed game I own or did own. It absolutely defines RPG for computer gaming because it is SO close to a real table top RPG with a real life DM. And best of all- Witcher 2 has the best, most rewarding combat I've ever played. The finesse of Soul Calibur, the severity of Dark/Demon Souls and the beauty of a novel dreamed of in your head. The plot, the acting (voice and animation) the script, the animation and texture work... they're all without peer on consoles. IF you have the ability to play this on high settings on your PC- naturally go for it there. I don't. I don't know anyone who does as a matter of fact. So for me and those like me- this is the only and best way to experience the masterpiece of this genre.A word to the wary: This is NOT a hack and slash game. This is NOT a casual, pick it up every month or so for a day or two. This game demands skill, tactics and dedication. And for that, you're rewarded with the most satisfying game style and combat mechanics I've ever experienced, and I've played them all.This game is also- VERY MUCH SO- not for kids. Parents who foolishly buy this for their kids without paying attention to the M rating will have their hair fall out when they see the realistic world of the Witcher.I could go on and on about the amazing graphics and art direction, but save your time by visiting the official website or any game review page. The game is brilliantly executed and illustrated. I will say that if you can't install the game onto your drive (13.5 gigs) then be prepared for loading. Once you do have it in the HD though, those loads are often less than 2 seconds each. In other words- MAKE ROOM, you won't regret it. I'm only half way through the game- maybe- and I can't stress enough how this is without a doubt, my game of this generation. I can't wait to see how I feel when I'm done for the first time.For those looking for the ultimate Western RPG- look no farther. You've undoubtedly purchased an Xbox for it's dedication and noted Western RPG reputation and this is the highest form I've seen of that style yet. If you're more into Japanese RPG's (the majority of what the PS3 is known for attracting), this will likely be of NO interest to you as it is a VERY mature plot and cast of characters. No kids looking to discover \"love, friendship and true courage\". Nor are there any cute talking animals or flying ships. I don't mean to offend anyone- just giving a warning for the system/player types that have created the stereotypes out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2012"}

I am really impressed and am glad that I did.  There are two modes: racer and police.  You can customize features on the vehicles such as color and license plates.  There are a decent amount of features to make the car your own while not overwhelming you.  In the past I hadn't liked the idea of the open world as much as just picking races.  Rivals changed my mind.  When you are connected to PSN, your world is populated with other players.  These players can be other racers or cops that race against you or try to take you down.  It adds a whole level of immersion that hasn't really been done before.  As a racer you can pull up to another car you can challenge them to a race or as a cop you can flip on your lights and start chasing someone when they blast past you.  This is cool on its own but it's even better when you throw in other players.  The game gets your adrenaline pumping especially when your losing a cop and hope he doesn't catch up to you.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Roman","summary":"A pretty decent action game, but nothing shocking.","reviewText":"When Infamous first came out, it didn't look all that great to me. We've seen tons of games that try to do the good/evil thing, and there are only a few games where your decisions really make a big difference in the game. I also wasn't impressed by the gameplay videos I'd seen- a dude with lightning powers running around a bleak city with comic book-style cutscenes here and there. But when the PSN fiasco happened last year, I still chose it as one of my two free games, mainly because I didn't have much to loose. After playing through the game, I can't say that Infamous is a bad game...not at all. But I don't feel like it's a \"must own\" or one of the best on the ps3. Infamous is a decent semi-open world game where there's a lot to do, but it's more quantity than quality here.The story starts out with a bang- Cole MacGrath is a bicycle courier in Empire City who is caught in a massive explosion when a device called the Ray Sphere goes off. It destroys part of the city and ends up giving him the power to manipulate electricity. Soon after the explosion, a plague starts making its way through the city, leading to a quarantine that keeps the Neon District (where the game starts) from the other two districts: The Warren and The Historic Districts. Cole has a girlfriend, Trish, that blames him for her sister's death, and begins to shun him early in the game. Cole's only real friend seems to be Zeke: an Elvis-looking dude that envies Cole's powers but has his back through thick and thin. An FBI agent named Moya is also in contact with Cole, requesting his help with missions in hopes of finding another agent named John White. At the same time, there are gangs that are wreaking havoc through the Districts, and it's up to you to either be the City's savior or rule over everything with an electric fist.Where Infamous shines is being able to run around doing as you please. You can just stick to the main story missions, or clear out other ones on the map that, when completed, are no longer under control by the gang of that area. The first couple of hours I played, I just took care of these side missions and had a bit of fun doing so. Some of the missions have you finding hidden packages, freeing captive civilians, escorting gang members to the police, restoring power to trains, and more. Aside from the missions, there are Blast Shards to collect. These are little blue crystal-like objects that you need to collect in order to add another unit to Cole's electricity storage used for his special powers like electric grenades. As you take out enemies and do other things to gain XP, you can use the points to upgrade certain abilities, though some of them can only be unlocked based on your karma status. Whether you choose to be good or evil, you can have different takes on certain abilities, with the evil versions being much more violent than the good versions. If you want to be good, then you'll want to do your best to make sure that no innocent people get hurt, heal the sick as you're running around on the streets, and do the right thing in missions that affect your karma. But if you want to be bad, you can suck the life out of hurt people instead of healing them, and drain the life from downed enemies as well instead of simply binding them to the floor.The thing is...as time goes on, a lot of these things get very repetitive. The variety in missions is very low, and by the time I got to the third District, I was predicting which one would be an escort mission and which one would be another 'help, kill all the bad guys!' one, of which there are many, and was usually right. This wouldn't be so bad if completing a mission freed up more than 3% of the map. Yes, nearly every mission will free up a mere 3% of the map, so you'll be spending lots of time doing the same kind of mission over and over...over the span of 3 Districts. Transportation being on the slow side didn't help matters either. At first, you're stuck just running around or scaling buildings and jumping from rooftop to rooftop until you finally get the power to grind like a rollerblader on electric wires and rails. It gets old when you die just before starting a mission, only to be revived at a medical clinic on another island, and you have to travel all the way back to where you were, which can take quite a while, and you're still being gunned down by the more-accurate-than-usual enemies. Them being accurate isn't a bad thing, but when there's tons of them chasing after you, and all you want to do is get to a certain spot, it can be a hassle to turn around and try to take them out without being blasted apart until you get stronger powers. My main problem with the game though is how Cole had the tendency to go cling to objects that I wasn't aiming for when I was trying to navigate on a building or land after jumping off a telephone pole wire. There's a type of mission where you have to run past objects on the roofs of buildings within a certain time frame. Sometimes you have less than 10 seconds, and when jumping off a wire, Cole would turn and grab onto something I was moving -away- from. This happened a lot when I was trying to take cover from enemies in the streets too, leading to many deaths. Hopefully this isn't a problem in the sequel.As for the plot, it's pretty standard until the end, which isn't anything new, but still caught me by surprise, and that was cool. I liked how certain characters didn't have much of a resolution, but I can't help but feel like the choice you make should have a bigger impact than they do. There's one point towards the end of the game where you have to make a big decision in who you save, and when you play through the game a second time and make a different choice, it's disappointing to see what happens. Combat is pretty fun with the range of powers Cole has. Regular lightning bolts that he shoots from his hand, a giant shockwave that launches enemies and objects back, a huge Pikachu-esque storm that eradicates everything in your way, electric grenades that can bind enemies when they're fully upgraded, thrusters that let Cole hover, and a really cool orb that can be guided towards enemies. There's even a neat precision targeting attack that takes up a lot of energy, but slows down the action and lets you get easy head shots. Combat is probably where people will have the most fun.It feels wrong to give the game 3 stars overall, and if I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars instead. But with all the problems caused by Cole clinging to things I didn't want him to, and quite a few bugs that made Cole jump through the ground and into a blue oblivion, making me reload my file, I have to round it down. If you can get it for a good price, then by all means go for it. I plan on getting the sequel soon and hope that they fixed most of the problems I had with this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses. When foes get close, they fare no better, as they come face-to-muzzle with her pistol and her shotgun &ndash; or perhaps the jaws of her faithful black hound. Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...ReinhartReinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar. Reinhart is known for his unconventional thinking and innovative magical techniques...and for his eccentricity, too.","reviewerName":"Eddie the Lizard","summary":"ok for a little while, i guess..","reviewText":"bought it CHEAP, played it for about 2 hours then got tired of it.

God of War III is one of the best games available on the PS3 right now.  The graphics are incredbile and the scale of the battles is like nothing that has been done before on a console.  Right from the start it is epic as you start out battling on Gaia, a huge rock titan, it is pretty amazing.  If you don't enjoy hack and slash you might not enjoy this but honestly it is more than just \"mash button x\" all the time.  If you get frustrated easily make sure you choose the easiest difficulty setting because this game is pretty brutal on the harder settings.  You can't just run up to the bosses and mash the buttons randomly and get the easy kill.  It takes more skill than that.  The various weapon, magic, etc. upgrades are a nice touch also.  If you're not sure whether you will like this game I suggest downloading the demo from the Playstation Network first.On another note this game is certainly NOT for younger kids in my opinion.  It is filled with gore and has some sexual scenes so buy accordingly.  It is rated M for mature after all.  Personally I love this game.  It's a blast to play and one of the best looking games out there.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins.

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Incredible looking, Incredible campaign","reviewText":"You don't need to play the first Crysis to play this game. It stands out on its own. I just have to say that the campaign is incredible for many reasons. It is more open world uses to allow you to play the game in either a stealthy or go guns blazing. Unlike many other games, this one gives you the ability to use camouflage (like Predator), gives you armor to boost your protection, and allows you to move extremely fast. These abilities share a meter. When you use them, it will drain and you have to wait for it to recharge. Unlike most other games (are all games that I can recall) this game lets your survey the area and target all enemies in view so you will know where they are at all times regardless if you can't see them.Just like a lot of other games, it has set pieces, those dramatic cut scenes. They are done here in impressive fashion and wrapped around what has to be said, easily one of the best looking games on consoles. It does draw distances to view everything ahead of you better than any other game. It boosts sharp visuals without any grainy effects. It has impressive lighting that foreshadows multiple objects. It is a stunning looking. Besides the graphics, the gameplay does compliment it by giving you those choices how to play but also giving you smart A.I., great weapons to play with, and great and varied locations to play in.Besides the great campaign, the multiplayer has its problems. It is great in concept. It can still be fun but its riddled with bugs every so often. These problems can be fixed with a firmware update. its still playable but can hamper the game at times. I tried to shot at one point only not to see my gun and one person looked as if he was hovering in the air. Not good stuff but it hasn't been a occasional affair. The game though does some great things by mixing Halo and Call of Duty together. You can still use all your abilities from the campaign but you can also enhance them with upgrades. There is a whole level system that ranks up your abilities by what you use. The level up system is pretty deep. Its fun and at times can be pretty addictive to play but I wouldn't be surprised if you run into a bug or two.I recommend this game. The campaign is one of the best this generation, especially for a game will garner peoples' attention on the multiplayer. It does some unique things, has an interesting story, and some amazing encounters. I can't say its a hard game. Its learning curve isn't steep but when you encounter mechs, they are a pain.

Sure, Crysis 2 looks nice (but it's still only marginally better looking than a lot of other xbox 360's top games) but that's ALL it has going for it.  This game is about as much fun as watching paint dry.  Actually come to think of it, I think I'd rather watch paint dry.  This is the anti-action game.  Oh sure, there's an occasional enemy to take out and hey you can even use a stealth mode (which stupidly punishes you for using it).  Mostly though-my experience with this game consisted of walking around a lot admiring the scenery.  I really tried hard to slog through this game, but man it was a complete snoozefest.  After experiencing a lot of bugginess in the game, I finally got to a point where I hit a serious game glitch and I could not get my character to proceed at all.  Somehow quitting the game and shutting off the console did nothing to counter the bug.  Every time I started playing again the game consistently glitched in the same place from there on out.  I figured that was a sign from the gods to give up on this bugtacular boring as nails throw away game anyway so that's exactly what I did.  What a worthless waste of time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

I've played a LOT of shooters, and this is one of my all-time favorites. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is fluid and awesome, and (most importantly), it's just plain fun. Story is decent...way above average for a shooter, though shooters aren't known for their stories. The fact that this story is decent is actually saying a lot, then.But it almost doesn't matter because the gameplay itself is so good. Just so well executed. Lots of upgrades that make you want to keep playing, and this is by no means a short game...one of my pet peeves is all of these \"marquee\" games that have skimpy single player campaigns (I'm looking at you, COD games!). I'm a SP games...couldn't care less about online, multiplayer nonsense. Local multiplayer is one thing, but I'm not getting online with a bunch of teenyboppers who love to park themselves somewhere and snipe people at a spawn point. No thanks. Crysis 2 has one of the meatiest SP campaigns I've played (especially for a shooter)...and it's not just that it's got decent length; it's that it's all quality, fun stuff that you're doing throughout.Overall, an absolute joy to play, and I can't recommend it highly enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVMYA","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Best Handheld Ever","reviewText":"I've had my red Nintendo 3DS for a little over a year. I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of this handheld. To me, the 3DS may very well be the best handheld video game console ever. Here is my review of this awesome little device. Just a warning, it's a long review, but I think it will help.*MY STORY WITH THE SYSTEM*To be honest, at around the time the 3DS was about to be released, I was very skeptical about the system. I really thought that the 3D effect would be a total gimmick and that it wouldn't work that well. I stood firm to that opinion until one day I was with my friend who had recently got a 3DS. I told him that I thought the 3D didn't work well, and that's when he plopped the system down in front of my face and I saw the 3D effect for the first time. I was really taken aback. The 3D effect was amazing. It took me a moment to see the effect (as it was my first time seeing it), but once I did I was amazed. I was still sorta skeptical about the system. Then my mom told me that she got a 3DS and Mario Kart 7 for my younger brother for Christmas, and that she wanted me to test it out to see if he would like it. So I did. One day in the whee hours of the night, I set up my brother's system, fiddled around with it, and then put Mario Kart 7 in and played every cup in the game. Three hours later, I wanted my own. With the help of my dad, I sold my DSi and bought a red 3DS. My mom even wrapped it up and gave it to me on Christmas to surprise me (I was expecting it to arrive after Christmas).I do not regret my purchase. I had my DSi for only a year-and-a-half before I sold it. And, to be honest, I never really played my DSi that much. At one point it went without being played for four months. The same cannot be said with my 3DS. I play it on a daily basis and I love it.So here is my review. It will sound a little more critical than my Wii U (which was glowing) review mainly because I'm moreso pointing out the negatives.The 3DS runs on a \"glasses-free 3D\" effect. So, how exactly does the glasses-free 3D effect work? The top screen of the 3DS acts like two separate screens. It is designed so that one eye sees a certain amount of pixels while the other eye sees another amount. When you look at the 3D screen at an angle, you will see a double image. That's the pixels at work. When you look at it straight on, the pixels collide, creating a stereoscopic 3D effect. The 3D effect of the system is not so much as \"pop out\" (although there are some wonderful examples of this) as it is \"in depth.\" The 3D screen is basically a little window that you look into and see the world in depth. This received some criticism, as most people are used to the wowing pop out effect of 3D movies. However, the effect is done beautifully and it really works...just as long as you look at it straight on. That's the main problem. The 3D \"sweet spot,\" as it's called, is very small. Move you're head or the system just a little bit and the 3D effect is gone. You have to hold your head very steady and if you move, be sure to adjust the system accordingly. But what if the 3D effect starts to give you a headache, or starts to make your eyes strain? No biggie, just slide the 3D slider all the way down, and you're now looking at a crisp 2D image. The 3D effect has been used in many different ways in the different games released for the system. In Super Mario 3D Land, the 3D is used for levels specifically designed to use the 3D effect to show where a hovering block is positioned as opposed to 2D mode, the same exact block would blend in with the wall. In Mario Kart 7, the 3D is used to give a sense of distance. In Paper Mario: Sticker Star, the 3D is also used for distance, but, when you go into \"paperize mode,\" AKA, make the world into a flat piece of paper, the 3DS INSTINCTIVELY turns off the 3D and puts the system into 2D mode...making the whole \"flat like a piece of paper\" gig work...and it works well. And when you exit \"paperize mode,\" the 3D turns back on. This little detail was well carried out.Now for the build of the system itself. The system is rather small, yet it fits perfectly in your hand. The system features two outer cameras, which, when used together, can produce a 3D image. It also has an inner camera that can only take 2D pictures. The inside top half is painted black to make the 3D effect of the top screen pop out more. The bottom inside half features a resistive touch screen, a 360 degree analog control stick called the \"Circle Pad,\" the standard D-pad (the + button located under the Circle Pad), the typical diamond pattern of A, B, Y, and X buttons, a power button, and Select, Home, and Start buttons along the bottom of the touch screen. L and R trigger buttons are found on the back of the system. The system also has a headphone jack, an extendable stylus for the touch screen, a charging port, an SD card slot, and a 3DS/DS game cartridge port. The system overall is very well built, however, when opened, the top screen does not lock into place as is implied by the clicking noise it makes when opened. The hinge just seems poorly built, however, it is not loose and it has not broken...yet. The system also has a shiny, glossy finish over it. Although it looks nice, it makes the 3DS prone to sunlight glare (which makes it difficult to see the 3D) and fingerprint smudges.The 3DS has a rechargeable battery which, unfortunately, does not have good life. The battery life, with the 3D effect turned on full blast, the volume turned all the way up, the wireless turned on, and the brightness turned all the way up (brightness level 5 of 5), only lasts at most 4 hours. I keep my 3DS at full blast 3D, brightness level 2 of 5, volume halfway turned up, and wireless on, and I can squeeze out 5.5 to 6 hours of battery life. What makes this worse, however, is the fact that it takes 2 hours just to charge the system. This is a big problem...a poor battery life with a recharge time that sometimes takes half as long as the battery life. Not very convenient for an on-the-go system.Now let's move on to the features. First and foremost, the 3DS features Mii Maker, an updated version of the Mii Channel on the Wii. On Mii Maker, you create a personal Mii, or an avatar of yourself. You typically image your Mii after yourself, or you can get creative...for example, I made some of the Harry Potter characters on Mii Maker. The head Mii (or the 1st Mii created on the system) is shown as the \"owner\" of the system and it is used when saving files in games. Your Mii is also how you indicate yourself in online interactions, such as online racing in Mario Kart 7. Next, the 3DS has a friend list, which you use to friend other people you know who have a 3DS. Only problem is that your friend code is a really long numerical code that is inconvenient when it comes to exchanging codes. Nintendo luckily fixed this problem with the new Wii U, where you can simply search for your friend by name in Miiverse, a social network similar to Facebook but for Nintendo games and applications. I heard the 3DS was going to get Miiverse at some point this year, so hopefully we can say \"Be gone!\" to the long numerical friend codes when Miiverse finally comes to the 3DS. Next, the 3DS has a camera and sound app, where you can take pictures and record 10-second sound clips and you can alter them in funny ways. The 3DS came preinstalled with the \"Face Raiders\" app, an app that utilizes the 3DS's outer cameras and gyroscope to simulate you moving around to shoot enemies. The system also comes with 6 AR cards, which are used for the AR Games app. The 3DS's outer cameras can recognize these AR cards, and you can do really amazing things, such as create a hole in the surface the card is placed on. This technology is truly brilliant and is really fun to play with. The 3DS also has an Internet Browser, but it's pretty much useless as it cannot do anything that plays videos or requires Flash (such as YouTube) and it's very slow (slower than the Wii U loading times, it's that bad).Lastly, let's talk about the 3DS's online store, called the Nintendo eShop. On the eShop, you can purchase small mini-games or games from the Virtual Console, which features games made for the NES and the Gameboy that you can download and play on your 3DS. You can also download the classic Super Mario Bros. from the eShop. You can also download free apps such as Netflix, Nintendo Video (a video service that features 3D videos), and Swapnote (an app where you \"swap notes\" with your 3DS friends). Also on the eShop, you can watch game trailers and previews, download demos, and learn about brand new games on the eShop exclusive show, Nintendo Show 3D, hosted by Jessie Kentrall (spelling?). On the show, Jessie teaches you about the newest features and games coming to the 3DS and the eShop. And, starting with New Super Mario Bros. 2, released in August of 2012, you can download full retail games from the eShop. Most first party games and some third party games are now available for purchase from stores and from the eShop. While the eShop sounds great, it's lacking in appealing content. It sadly suffers from \"Apple App Store Disease,\" meaning it has a lot of apps but only a small amount of apps are worth purchasing and downloading. Most of the apps are pointless and aren't worth your time and money. I think Nintendo is trying to turn this around by allowing full retail games to be purchased from the eShop.The 3DS is backwards compatible with all DS/DSi games. Unlike the Wii U's surprising upscaling the quality of Wii games, the 3DS actually makes the DS games a little bit blurrier. Also, since the 3DS's top screen is widescreen while the DS's top screen is standard format, there will be black bars to the sides of the picture on the top screen. The Circle Pad IS compatible with regular DS games, but it is immediately obvious that it does not work that well. DS games were not developed to use the Circle Pad, and it makes the controls really slippery. And it's very uncomfortable to use the D-pad considering it's awkward positioning on the system.RECAP ON NEGATIVE CRITICISMS:-Glossy finish, although nice, distorts the 3D effect-3D \"Sweet Spot\" too small-Hinge is wobbly and feels cheap-Poor battery life, depending on the settings-Long recharge time-Extremely long and frustrating friend codes...hopefully will be fixed when Miiverse comes to 3DS-Useless and slow Internet browser-Content-lacking eShop-Problems with backwards compatibility*FINAL VERDICT: 95%*I love my 3DS. I love every second I spend with it. I'm worried that now that I have a shiny new Wii U, my 3DS will lie forgotten, similar to how my DSi was forgotten for a while after we got our Wii. However, I know this will not happen. The 3DS holds a stronger place in my heart than my DSi did, and I can tell that I will be getting the best out of my 3DS. I still play it daily and I will never stop doing so. The 3DS has a very strong game library as is and there are more games coming. The 3DS has a bright future on the horizon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

I loved the fact that I didn't have to go recruiting companions this time around like in Mass Effect 2 which became a tedious chore, a welcome change.  Regarding Mass Effect 2 and it's companions, I wish some of them would've been included as party members other than being relegated to guests on secondary quests.  The conclusion was a good one and obvious really due to it being the conclusion of the protagonist.

I've been defending early reviews of it saying these people didn't know how to play a MGS game.  Once I got the game, I quickly understood the hatred for it.  Not counting the beginning and ending cutscene, I died twice and still beat the entire game in 63 minutes.  It is embarrassing.  I know it's a prologue but really....an hour?  Not even worth the 30 bucks.  The only redeeming factors of this game are that the sound and graphics are better than any next gen game I've played (which are pretty much all).  The storyline isn't even fun or grasping.  You just rescue two people, put them in a helicopter and watch the end movie which is probably the cost of the production of the game in just making those sweet explosions.I am excited for The Phantom Pain and will buy it; but this game does MGS fans no favors.  Please rent this if you can.  Otherwise, just wait for it to be free with Phantom Pain (which I'm sure it will be)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

When I got a wireless controller for my Gamecube a while back it was very sluggish when you tried to move a character or to do any action it would send the information so slowly that by the time you hit the punch or kick button and the data was sent to the console 3 or 4 seconds had already passed.  So when I saw the xbox 360 wireless controller I was very skeptical on how it would play but after a few games I was quickly pleased by the speed that the controller sent the data info to the console there was no lag time with the movement or actions you would do with the controller.  I was shocked to see when I would hit the punch button or action button it was instantaneous there was no 3 or 4 second pause time for the response during the game playing.I have now bought another one as well for a second player this to has connected excellently with the Xbox 360 and of course plays just as well as the first one.  As you see on Amazon you can get different color controllers and it's up to you which one to get for myself I just got the black and blue one and am going to buy my sister the pink one for her to play with but again whichever one you get you will not be disappointed...Oh yes I would also say if you get this you should also buy the play&charge; kit as well it will save you a greatdeal of money on the batteries...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2008"}

I've followed the company's career with interest through the years, getting just about every game they've put out...including Jak and Daxter:The Precursor Legacy. That game was an interesting change for Naughty Dog but a welcome one and, I must admit, I loved the game(Not too difficult, not too easy....jusssst right!). So, it was with great enthusiasm that I looked forward to Jak II. I figured, when I found out he'd be toting a gun in this game, that it'd be something along the lines of what Insomniac(makers of Ratchet and Clank) was putting out but set in Jak and Daxter's world. Yet, I was wrong. It ended up being alot like Grand Theft Auto III, with platform elements thrown in. Not that it's a bad thing....Grand Theft Auto is a classic that will always be revered in time to come by the masses, including me. Thing is, it just wasn't quite like I imagined it to be. Course, Change is good and, for the most part, it works. I'm glad to see Naughty Dog is trying to give us something new...not the same old same old. I applaud them for that. Graphically, the game is absolutely stunning, overshadowing the original. The game is definitely worth getting and adding to your  collection. One thing, though, why did they have to make it so infuriatingly difficult, at times?? Not that I mind a good challenge....in fact, I live for one in my games....but, why to the point where I throw down my controller in disgust?? Maximo:Ghosts to Glory is the only other game that I can remember in recent memory that was as hard and, even then, this game makes it look like a cakewalk. Course, the reward afterward makes it all worthwhile, I guess. So, it depends on how you look at things.Overall, Jak II is a solid platformer further pushing the envelope in the genre. Just come into it looking for a challenge, cause you're definitely going to get one. I just hope they continue to push the envelope and give us something even more new with the next game. If they can do that, they will still have me as a fan....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2004"}

In this world an hour goes by in about a minute real time, so this gives you barely over an hour real time to do the job. Sound stressful?Luckily, Link can use his Ocarina to go back in time whenever he wishes, in essence resetting that 3 day countdown. This can be helpful at times, and REALLY annoying at other times. Reset in time and you lose all cash on you, as well as any quest items, but somehow the bank still has your money and you still have your masks. You lose your maps, you keep your sword. Does this make sense? No, but it's the way the game works.The first section of the game is perhaps the worst designed, and unfortunately this might turn players off before they give the game a chance to shine. It is relatively difficult to get to the ocarina in the first place - meaning you have to play over and over again without ANY ability to save! You can't leave the town either, or do much of anything, so the frustration can get high. Just work through it, or refer to a walkthrough, because the game gets MUCH better once you get the ocarina.Once you've got it, you can save, become Link or many other creatures with the neat masks. The characters in the game react to you differently based on what mask you are wearing, and you even get different skills based on the mask.There are a wide variety of interesting quests going on. Meet one character, and they are looking for another character. Ask around, and arrange to meet someone at a certain time for more information. You start carrying parcels around to various people, and in the end, you've made a group of people happy! A notebook you carry helps you keep track of who you talked to when, and who you still need to help out.The time changes are great. Dawn becomes slowly rosy, and night descends with gentle dusk. Thieves only come out at night, characters go around on their business rounds, and depending on the time of day or day of the week characters are doing completely different things. Start back at Day 1 and you can see it all happen again.The game tries to help out players with the time, too. You can slow time down so it goes as slow as molasses, or you can jump ahead to the next day if you're finished with your tasks for a day. You can jump back to Day 1 at any time as long as you have the Ocarina, and owl statues let you save the game exactly where you are, just in case you have to do something boring like eat dinner.I find, once you get past the initial stage of the game, that it is greatly challenging and fun. It might be stressful for younger gamers, because everything is extremely deadline based. Instead of the old Zelda, where you could wander around and enjoy the journey as much as you wished, in this game you have to race from point to point to get your current quest in before the 3 day cycle begins again.If you enjoy time-based challenges and lots of jump-exactly-here-and-then-there kinds of action, along with a bit of RP puzzling added in, then you will love this newest member of the Zelda family!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2000"}

Really happy that it's released 1 week ahead of schedule.  But if this early release caused this technical glitch, rather waited.There is a very noticeable slowdown anytime there is animation in the battles.

Ninjutsu is a special power that results in an explosive electrical force to either stun enemies or protect oneself from attack. Only true Ninja Masters can achieve this technique.Interactive quick-time events:Scattered throughout integral parts of the storyline, characters will come across various quick-time events where players will have the opportunity to directly interact with in-game cut-scenes.

While games like Ninja Gaiden are smooth, difficult, and epic, Ninja Blade feels more like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vs. Godzilla.Story: 4/10Alpha Worms infest the human population, turning them into violent and deadly mutants.  The Worms can also create giant Godzilla sized monsters for epic boss battles.  You play an American Ninja who's father was Japanese, but was created in a lab, and there's some mention of your mother...  Umm... you're basically a video game character designed to kill monsters!  That's pretty much all you need to know.  The story doesn't make much sense and the dialogue is more befitting of a surfer movie than an epic action film.Gameplay: 8/10There are 3 types of gameplay in Ninja Blade and all are fun.1. Hack and Slash Sword Fighting and Ninja Magic vs. Zombies and BossesThis is the core of the game.  There are 3 weapon types (katana, massive heavy sword, and fast twin blades) and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.  There are a fair amount of combos for each weapon and the combat is fluid and complete with finishing moves.  You also get elemental Ninja Magic for fighting enemies and using the environment to your advantage.  All of your weapons and magic can be upgraded by collecting orbs found in the environments or by killing enemies.2. Quicktime EventsReminiscent of Dragon's Lair, a crazy action scene plays and you press the right button at the right time to keep the sequence going.  If you mess up, it's ok, the scene rewinds a few seconds and you can keep trying until you get it right.  These action scenes are so over the top... It's like watching a Popeye cartoon if Popeye had 10 cans of Spinach...  It's like a Jason Statham Movie x 100... We're talking Superman on meth!  They're so ridiculous, you can't take them seriously; but they still manage to be fun.  (Mostly because the game doesn't overpunish you by killing you if you make a mistake.)  Also, if you have having trouble with these, you can adust the Quicktime Difficulty on the Options Menu!3. Rail ShooterThere are some scenes in the game where you're on a helicopter or vehicle, firing a .50 cal machine gun or rocket launcher.  These scenes are very exciting and pretty easy.  Simply put... FUN.The game mixes all 3 types of gameplay fairly often and it keeps the game from feeling stale.  If you die, Checkpoints are fairly generous and you can continue at the last one.  At the end of each of the 9 Missions, you get a score based on how well that you did.  THIS IS THE ONLY TIME THE GAME SAVES.  Unfortunately, you can't save during a Mission.  (Each Mission is about 60-30 minutes.)Sound/Music:  6/10The explosions and roars of the giant mosters are LOUD, and the sound contributes to the action, but the soundtrack is pretty weak.  It's almost as if the team was finishing the game and somebody said, \"Hey, we should put some music in here.\"  The background music is just there.  Some tracks are exciting and others are bad.  One of them sounds like a guy with a saxophone is in an electric chair.  (If you played the game, you know what I'm talking about.)Art:  8/10The art is pretty good overall.  From the visual effects, to the character designs, to the Tokyo Skyline, the graphics and animations are all very good.Overall: 7/10The game is fun and it doesn't try to be anything else.Ninja Blade is Rated M for Violence and Gore.If you're looking for a fun action game that's not too hard, this is it.  With a Shadow of the Colossus Soundtrack, a Real Story, and Less Silly Action Scenes, this could have been in the same league as God of War.  Unfortunately, the game is more 'action cartoon comedy' than epic masterpiece.  Because the game is fairly short, the hero is completely forgettable, and replay value is limited, this makes a great rental.Avoid this one if you hate Quicktime Events, Ridiculously Unrealistic Fight Scenes, or Bad Dialogue.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

If you give the title a chance however, you are likely to find that its quirky characters and story will engage your attention in a way that other games with their multi-million dollar budgets simply cannot. With that much money on the line, no mainstream studio would ever greenlight a project as weird as this game.The graphics are far from terrible, and in a way they have a certain charm that requires you to use your imagination to fill in the blanks. Deadly Premonition reminds me of the sort of bizarre japanese games that were de rigueur on the Dreamcast, games like Illbleed, Maken X, and D2. The investigation is over 20 hours long and there is an abundance to see and do in the town of Greenvale. Gamers with an open mind who would like to see something different, or maybe just to revisit an earlier era of far-out gaming that is now all but dead, should not hesitate to give Deadly Premonition a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

READ ON!","reviewText":"Okay, so most of us know about how popular the original Goldeneye was for the Nintendo 64. I just want to get it out of the way that I am not here to compare the two games. I am instead simply going to tell you why this game is total garbage...First off let me just say that the graphics are very good. The character models look very nice and, although subtle, the facial expressions that characters express help them come to life and feel real. The weapons look excellent and the level environments obviously had a lot of effort put into them.But all these things won't save the game from the wreck that is to come...Immediately, right off the bat this game is just another generic shooter. Sneaking has been, for the most part, removed, instead being replaced by killing 50,445 people over the course of the game. Many times will you move to a section, kill 50 enemies, move to a different section, kill another swarm of 50 enemies, so on and so forth.The game has a few areas where you are allowed to sneak, but they are incredibly obvious and run on a very basic set of rules. You can always tell when the developers intend for you to sneak. Allow me to explain. Sneaking in this game means you cannot get too close to moving enemies. Even though you make no noise while crouched, enemies who are mobile will see you through walls should they get in close enough proximity to you. Enemies who are standing still will NEVER MOVE and can only see you if you literally walk up to their face. Mobile, or not, enemies will not notice if you gun down their comrades, unless you do so with a loud weapon or if the enemies you are killing are in a group. That's right, some enemies chill in a group, usually consisting of 2-3 people. They never move and just stand around. The challenge to these guys is that in order to kill them, you have to neutralize them all in a set amount of seconds or else reinforcements (who didn't even see anything) will become alerted to your presence. The AI is so basic in this game you can actually sneak up behind immobile enemy groups and melee one of them down with your nunchuk (an instant kill at close quarters) and the remaining members of the group won't hear him grunt in pain, hit the floor, or anything, as long as their backs are to you.So one can see just from playing for an hour that the developers put no time into the AI. This is one of those games where enemies either know exactly where you are, or have no clue. It's cheap. The whole game is basically one big firefight with no way to outsmart or get the drop on the AI. Then, during the occasional sneaking part, the AI has no way to see you as long as you're careful enough not to trigger the basic programming. The enemy also gets grenades, whereas you get none.... ????? Explain...The story is trash and goes downhill after the Dam level in the beginning, which I'll admit is easily the best level in the game. I won't delve into it so as to not spoil anything for anyone but let me just say, it's nothing worth getting excited over.The only thing helping this game is the multiplayer. The ability to hop online and play against others who aren't dumb like the AI is a great thing to have. The game connects fast and loads matches in no time at all. For the little while that I played I also experienced little to no lag. The only reason the MP isn't that great is because there's really no community (like, 26 people play) and the game doesn't support Wii Speak or any other way to communicate.I'd say if you absolutely must play this, rent it. I bought it and after I beat it I looked up info on extra content and discovered you get NOTHING for beating any of the difficulty levels or time trials... This makes no sense considering the original rewarded you for beating just about every level/difficulty level. I don't understand why they didn't add ANY unlockables at all in light of this. Time trial sucks because the inability to skip cut scenes can actually cost you the mission even though you finished the level in time but were forced to watch Bond pick his nose for 0:43.End.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

It's definitely taken my music listening to a new level with 7.1 surround sound. I've played multiple new tracks from iTunes and the sound is incredibly clear and it's a joy to hear the tracks like they were meant to be heard without interference of sounds around the home or the acoustics of my office and family room altering the sound. I would be curious to know from Logitech exactly how many speakers are in the headphones and would love to see an \"inside\" picture on this products web page.As long as some volume of music is being played through these wireless headphones they are noise isolating and it's helps me to concentrate on whatever I'm doing.I'm currently using these for skype, music listening, and for listening to audiobooks while I move around the house. I have had no trouble with sound quality despite being at the other end of the house. There are also some interesting voice effects, none of which I cared for but gamers would probably enjoy them. I also like how they instantly mute my end of the conversation by simply flipping the mic up.The headphones are very well built although the comfort level could use some improvement. They also feel awfully heavy on. If your headphones run out of battery power, they can be charged while in use, and the cord is VERY long at around 6 feet. It also has a nice touch - the charging cord has a USB plug about 1/2 way down the cord so it doesn't displace anything currently plugged into your computer. The plug that charges the headphones is also very standard. It's the same one that charges my bluetooth, cell phone, and Western Digital My Passport drive.Gamers, music listeners, skype users, and audiobook listeners will probably enjoy these headphones as much as me, but at this price, they would have to serve more than one purpose. I wouldn't buy these to do just one of those things.Also, these worked just perfect for me on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2010"}

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"IRVING","summary":"Action, Thrilling","reviewText":"Good game, one of the best after re4 series, and the six is good too i have the 3 and i cant complain, better in multiplayer online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

The art direction is really beautiful as are the graphics. I was a little surprised at the comedic approach they took in terms of the enemy bosses during the cutscenes but it sort of works.  The fighting mechanics consist of regular, quick and heavy attacks.  Your character will constantly block without having to press any buttons.  The kink is that you have to be in either regular or heavy stance in order to block the enemies' regular or heavy attacks, highlighted by their glowing blue or yellow swords as they attack you...it keeps you on your toes as some enemies can attack you with both combinations during their combos.  You also cannot jump which some people may not like. There are quick time events which I don't really like, but they're not too invasive.  You also have shooting moments where you will have to use the six axis controls.  It takes a little getting used to, but you grow accustomed to it, and it does mix up the gameplay a bit.  Some people complain about the length, but this is not meant to be an rpg or anything.  I actually like shorter games...6-8 hours, which I can finish on a weekend.  The last boss fight was a turn off for some, but it is really easy once you know the trick. I usually play a game and trade or sell it, but I am keeping this in my collection because it is unique, standing apart from the Ninja Gaiden's and God of War's out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"A.

Plan your strikes when your energy is the highest and connect with devastating blows instead of throwing blows when your stamina is low.Your opponent's anatomical damage gauge is lava red which appears that he/she will go down at any moment.BUT THEY NEVER DO..Then, all it takes is for the computer to get a few shots in on you and you go down or get knocked out.

However, when the game in question is Half Life, arguably the best selling and best reviewed game in modern computer history, the rules that apply to other titles simply do not apply here.  With a endless supply of fan made levels, modifications, dominating hard the world over, and with a mod, Counter Strike, being the most popular online game, one would wonder if Valve is in no rush to release a follow up to the game. The Highly anticipated Team Fortress 2 is over a year and a half past its anticipated release, and has yet to make it onto the release radar for the near future. Half Life 2 is a top secret project that has a tighter lid of security around it than the next Star Wars film and the Colonels secret recipe.  So what is a Half Life fan to do with nothing on the horizon save for a few fan mods? Well, the folks at Gearbox have created a follow up to their smash success Half Life Opposing Force and retuned to the Black Mesa Facility with  Half Life Blue Shift.  The original Half Life cats players in the role of scientist Gordon Freeman as he attempted to escape from the Black Mesa facility following a accident that saw the facility flooded with all manner of deadly creatures, as well as ruthless government troops sent to silence anyone who saw to much.  Opposing Force expanded the role by casting players as CPl Sheppard, and Special Forces soldier dispatched to Black Mesa to restore order.  In Blue Shift, players get to take on the role of security guard Barney Calhoun. The events in the game take place at the same time as the other two games, as Barney attempts to get out of the Black Mesa facility. Along the way, players will battle monsters, soldiers, solve puzzles, and help stranded scientists along the way.  While the game was fun, it was far to short. I was able to complete the entire game in under five hours, and found myself wanting more after I was done. The game does not offer any new weapons and while the graphics engine is updated, and updates the graphics on Half Life and Opposing Force, there really is little here to make it stand out from a fan made mod.  There are no new weapons, monsters, or settings in the game, and I was surprised to discover that the game did not feature a boss monster anywhere along the way as the previous games in the series did.  A further piece of concern, and yes it is nitpicking, is that the character you play in Blue Shift often interacted with Freeman and Sheppard in the previous games, but Freeman is seen only briefly, and has no real impact on the game.  That being said, it is important to know that Blue Shift was originally designed to be a console only game, and it was decided to offer the game for PC users as a bridge to the upcoming Half Life 2.  Blue Shift also comes with the full version of Opposing Force, a utility to update the graphic resolution of Half Life and Opposing Force, as well as a rebate for those players who have previously purchased Opposing Forces. The game also does not require any previous version of Half Life to play, though understanding the Half Life Story will greatly fill in the games storyline.  In summary, Blue Shift is a nice return to a classic game scenario but is far to short and fails when compared to the previous titles in the series.  7 out of 10 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS P233, 32Mb RAM 300Mb HDD RECOMMENDED SYSTEM PII-300, 64Mb RAM 3D accelerator","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2001"}

I pre-ordered mine and started playing as soon as Steam unlocked it. I've played about 30 hours, and have developed some opinions based on that game play.First off, the excellent bits:1) Graphics are great, and run smoothly even on mid range graphics cards.I run two 4870s in crossfire, but even my friend with a HD4670 can run all settings on high with 2x AA. That's really impressive for a game that is this visually appealing. Cut scenes are very well done and even well 'acted' since all character animations were based on green screens. This might be the game with the most lifelike human facial expressions, movements, etc. that I've ever seen. It pretty much pushed gaming forward in the same way Half Life II did a number of years back.2) The characters and storyline are for the most part excellent.Sheppard is back (and really back if you kept your ME1 saved game--you can start off right where you left off) and is better than ever. I love the voice actors they have for him/her and I love the voice acting in general. They went after some top-shelf talent including several of the cast of Battlestar Galactica for voices including the amazingly good Michael Hogan who's voice is spot-on perfect. Martin Sheen does the voice for Illusive Man and gives some respectability to another Smoking Man/G-man cliche character who would otherwise just be irritating (Seriously EA can't you have a little more imagination that this?). With a few exceptions characters are multifaceted and engaging. Interestingly, Miranda (the main female companion) is the most shallow and really doesn't interest me that much as a character. To bad, because both the Asari and Ashly from ME1 were amazingly rich and interesting characters. While it's likely Ash is coming back (no spoilers, she's shown in multiple of the trailers), so that might improve the 'relational' aspect of the game. Basically you can hit on just about anyone of the opposite sex as your Sheppard, which is pretty funny at times.3) Dialogue options are numerous and occasionally very funny or very sad.You can spend a lot of time talking to characters and learning a lot about the universe. These rarely open up new missions/options however, and I wish they'd done a better job of making conversation bring about new results or opening new missions. The only dialogue options that appear to lead to new things are those directly tied to the Paragon/Renegade options (you can pursue being good or bad in the same way you do in all Bioware games).4) The universe is more varied and detailed than ME1.Planets have a variety of flroa/fauna and cities and interiors have a lot more diversity. Omega is particularly good and really does feel like a seedy space station similar to Nar Shada from the Star Wars universe. Planets feel unique, not just another ball of dirt you drive a vehicle around on finding junk. I've heard a few complaints that Normandy II doesn't have a Rover--to me that is an improvement as I found the driving around bits to be tedious and didn't really add much to ME1.5) Normandy II is gorgeous. I love it. Enough said--check it out for yourself.6) Powers are more useful overall.They have limited the number and you could argue 'dumbed' the game down in this area, but my initial disappointment with the leveling system has been replaced with a respect for it's simplicity and usefulness. This is not a complex or deep RPG, but it provides enough of that element to keep me engaged.7) They've broadened the romance options in the game to allow for a grater number of choices and outcomes. This adds some interesting texture to the game, especially if you are playing a female Shepherd. Allowing for some inter species romance (outside of the Asari) really make things interesting._______________________________________________The Bad:1) The combat system is nowhere near as good as I had hoped.First off: They added clips. Seriously a huge mistake. One of the things I liked about ME1 was its avoidance of cliched clips/ammo/crates. Heat buildup was a very interesting alternative that ME1 used and it had real advantages (primarily not having to run around collecting clips to keep weapons ready). I wish they'd NOT changed this.From problems with combat tactics being totally cover dependent (more on that to follow) to squad behavior that defies reason, to certain weapons just feeling useless, the whole combat just feels like a muddle and not nearly as fun as I had hoped. The cover system is just plain bad: you will take cover, but hit the wrong side of a square/rectangle which leaves you open to fire--getting unstuck and back to the correct edge takes far too much time as the cover feels 'sticky' and doesn't allow for repositioning easily. Secondly, when you take cover, so does your team, even if they have superior position and firing lines. There is no way to get them to bloody charge when you want them to (especially if you are using the Krogan armed with a shotty) accept endlessly point them in the right direction using Q/E keys. I find that getting them to do anything tactical is a nightmare, and so playing on anything north of Veteran difficulty is very, very hard.The weapons are disappointing big time. The sniper riffle is over the top powerful in a way that makes the other weapons nearly useless by comparison. The shotgun is a prime example; there is no effective way (that I've discovered at least) to employ it like you could in ME1, whipping around corners and head-shotting several enemies at close range. It feels useless. Similarly, the assault weapon class also feels very useless. Pistols and the sniper riffles own the type of combat ME2 provides.Because of this, certain squad members feel much less useful than others, and my usual preference of having a shotty weilding Krogan for taking territory quickly and brutally just doesn't work in ME2. Sad. Basically if you arm all three team members with sniper riffles you can just waltz through almost every level very easily, since as soon as the sniper riffle is out of ammo, you just switch to the second best weapon like the Hand Cannon.2) Mini games are lame.Most of the mini games are lame. Especially scanning planets which takes forever, but is also mind numbingly repetitive. They did an ok job on all the in-mission ones which feel short enough to not distract from the overall immersion factor.3) Certain characters just feel stereotypical or boring.No more WREX. My favorite hands down from ME1. The sad Krogan they replaced him with just doesn't cut it. The new Krogan shouts things like \"Right on your A$$\" in combat. Not very Krogan like or threatening--it reminds me of some of the lame things the soldier shout in Far Cry I.Miranda is shallow. She just is. And why doesn't she have any armor? I know that she's for teenage fantasy world kids, but surely she could use some body armor just like Sheppard/other characters? This is a game designed for teenage boys when it comes to the female characters--sad that Bioware and EA don't recognize that there is a small (but growing) number of female gamers who would appreciate characters who are not so 'sexed up.' I'm not being prudish, just asking that female characters be given some semblance of realism and likability for more than being hot.(SPOILER ALERT--SPOILER AHEAD)Garrus? Really? He was lame in ME1 and they brought him back and not WREX?4) DLC has been a disappointment so far (once I even got it working).EA botched the DLC release when the game came out. I was unable to log into 'Cerberus' their online authentication server until days after the game release. Typical EA customer service nightmare ensued.Once I got my DLC, it was pretty lame:a) Inferno armor = poor quality and much worse than what you get soon into the gameb) Normandy crash site = ok; 5/10I hope they release better stuff in the future, like some of the really good Fall Out III DLCs. Maybe something that introduces a new character or powers or a set of missions that is expansive in more than a superficial way.5) There is a real lack of meaningful bosses in this game. There were few in the game in general, and the only two that felt challenging were the final boss and the boss of the Krogan's loyalty mission. ME1 had a number of diverse and entertaining bosses that ME2 sadly lacks.6) The game is shorter and feels 'smaller' than ME1.While art direction and locations have been improved over all, the game just feels small in many ways. For example, the Citadel has been made tiny by comparison to ME1 (probably because people complained about having to run around too much) and all the other 'worlds' are just as small. It makes it feel like you land on a whole planet just to explore a tiny warehouse full of small rooms. There are no real expansive levels that give the sense of being on an actual planet. I remember that KOTOR I and KOTOR II really were able to capture that feel, even with much inferior graphics. ME2 offers environments that are just linear, boxy, and small.The game ends too soon--I can't really say I felt like I got enough game play for my dollar, especially compared to a game like Fallout 3 or even Oblivion. Different sorts of games I know, but I thought there would be MUCH more content than there is. (I found all N7 missions and there are only about 10 of them vs. 30+ in ME1).Conclusions:ME2 is a great game. It's not perfect, but it's still well worth buying and playing. It doesn't quite live up to all the hoopla pre-release. It's not god's gift to gaming, but the strong story elements keep the game entertaining even when the combat isn't spectacular. For a team style game, ME2 is certainly rudimentary with leveling and powered minimized. Think of it as a movie you get to play through and you'll like it more. Hardcore RPG gamers will be left disappointed, but the average game fan is going to love ME2 for all the things that it does right.____________________________________________________Some responses to comments:To those who feel I'm being too critical:This game has been the most highly promoted game I've ever seen. Cross platform, mass appeal, and marketed intensely, it's safe to say this game has been hyped by everyone from EA to web pages devoted to gaming. Because of that, I think it's fair to be more critical of this game than others out there, since expectations were set so high. EA and Bioware have a history of making great RPG party style games (when they've not been crippled by DRM) such as KOTOR I, KOTOR II, etc. I feel that they should progress and learn from older games and IMPROVE from game to game in meaningful ways. I expected ME II to be that much better than ME I, and honestly, I found it to be a great game, but not a big step forward for Bioware. I may be more critical than the casual game fan, but that's because I genuinely love games and want to see them move forward in excellence. ME II is NOT A BAD GAME, and if any of you read into my summary that I dislike it or think it sucks, you need to read the review again. I tried to be very honest about what I really liked and what I didn't, with no agenda other than evaluating the game.Thoughts on the female characters:I do feel like the female characters in this game (with the exception of the Quarian who is fantastic) are shallow and stand in as mere sex symbols more than characters. Deep V neck armor (seriously, the Justicar should be on the front of one of those cheezy fantasy novels), form fitting outfits that defy logic for someone engaged in combat, the list goes on and on. I'm not opposed to SOME of the females being of that variety, but COME ON, give us a few characters that a female gamer can actually relate to! Not to mention EA/Bioware's strange inclusion of frequent lesbian gay relationships but not a single male gay relationship. This is strange considering the game's extremely flippant take on sexuality in general (inter-species relationships, pole-dancing in clubs, e-mails/coversations throughout the game about sex). I guess in the super open and futuristic world of ME II there are a whole race of space babe lesbians (Assari) but not a single gay male? This is a pandering double standard designed to appeal to juveniles who think girls getting it on is 'hot' but will shout epithets over TeamSpeak playing Halo. I'm not saying any game should support any agenda what-so-ever, only that that Bioware should take some notes from guys like Robert A. Heinlein and make the world they create be 'honest' and not manipulative.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2010"}

How well does this concept work?First, the controller, since this is the main aspect of the game. You generally need to have a table in front of you. Otherwise you'd be hunched over on the floor which would kill your back. Your right hand goes on the turntable, and your left on the slider switch.The right hand pushing the buttons and turning the turntable up and down is fairly easy. However, the slider on the left is a royal pain. You're supposed to slide it left, center and right. You have to get it exactly to each spot. Left and right are of course easy - but the center is challenging. Especially when the song is moving quickly, it just doesn't \"stop\" there well. The tiny notch you're aiming for is not indented enough.What I think they should have done instead is made a V shape. That way you go to the center of the V, or to either end. That way you can move quickly, but there's an actual \"notch\" to catch you in the middle.Gameplay is much like the other music games. Colored spots flow down the screen at you. When they reach the front, you press the corresponding button. There's a left-right component as well, which does add a tongue-twister kind of challenge to it. Can you slide forward with one hand while sliding left with the other?Again I loved the mental aspect of this challenge, trying to do two things at once, but the physical controller to slide is a royal pain.The song list is geared towards dance music. You might love this - you might dislike it. I'm more of a Rock Band song list person myself, so I'm on the side of \"less fond\" here. Still, music is a very personal thing and I'm sure others adore the list.While in the other music games there are equal men and women around, I do have to complain that DJ Hero has dancing girls on the stages which are provocatively dancing around. I suppose it's no worse than MTV videos, but it's not what I like to look at when playing music. Even worse, in my mind, the audience is NOT dancing!! They're all just standing there staring at you. That would be a pretty odd dance club! Surely they could have built in some dancing code so that your audience was actually dancing to the music?I only had access to the demo set, through Amazon vine, so I didn't see the full range of locations. For me it wasn't a big deal - I don't play for locations, I play for the song list. That was easy enough to see online.I do like the ability to play guitar with the DJ, so that will help guitar players happy when their friends want to DJ.In the end, if you love the song list, then you'll be happy. You get a ton of songs here that you probably don't see in any of the other music games. However, I think they could have done better with the controller and with the audience characters.Rating: a low 4/5 for fans of dance music.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

Herzog","summary":"Not just a great deal, a great game","reviewText":"The metroid trilogy may just be one of the best deals around.  I've always been surprised I don't see more collections of games that were hits.  I know there's the Sonic games and sega collections, but really there's not enough.  Luckily Nintendo decided to give people who didn't get a chance to play the awesome first two metroid games a chance.  But Nintendo didn't just port the game (which would've been fine with me), they actually added motion control and widescreen visuals.  This awesome addition made the games feel like I was playing the game again for the first time.  While I remembered some puzzles and bad guys, when I confronted them with the new controls, it made the game so much more fun to play, both being more interactive, but also adding a level of extra concentration to make sure you're doing everything correctly.As to the three different games, they remind me of the star wars trilogy.  The first is the begining of something new and fresh and is in a way stand alone.  The second is darker and more complicated, requiring more dedication from the player.  Then there is the third, which is more of a return to the first in style, but added a slew of other characters and story to round out the trilogy.I love these games, and replaying them with the new control was suprisingly more fun than I expected.  I highly recomend you give them a try if you have the wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2009"}

I am about 3 hours now into Doom, 5 hours into Doom 2 and about 6 hours into Doom 3 and if you're looking for a goodscare for Halloween this just might be what you're looking for.Graphics: Doom 1 and 2 are smoother but mostly the same monster textures are smoother though (doom 1 and 2) Doom 3 looks Fantastic with it's HD makeover and is so creepy compared to most games from this gen. 5 starsSound: excellent and exact in D1 and 2 Doom 3 really shines here I am talking sound effects that will set you up to be scared and you will jump, trust me. easily 5 starsGameplay: thankfully they tuned all THREE games to run perfectly off the dualshock which makes the game control without effort, also lots of options for gamma, and sensitivity for the speed for turning etc. 5 stars!Fun: after all these years Doom 3 still makes me jump and I love it. Doom 1 is as fun as I remember with all secrets right where they were in the original release. Doom 2 looks as good plus all hidden areas are still hidden well and the game plays perfectly Doom 3 is the perfect halloween scare game for me with it's Moody sounds and Creepy effects plus the Hd graphics. 5 stars!Overall: some long load times and slightly intrusive Game Saves (autosave)(sometimes the autosave takes you out of the moment and is annoying fortunately it's mainly before a cutscene or at the end of a level. these are about the only mar on an otherwise perfect Doom release package. Multiplayer is a blast and the single player is just as fun if not more fun then I had remembered.the graphical overhaul will have you on the edge of your seat since it really brought out the creepy atmosphere of this game. I'd recommend the Doom 3 BFG edition to anyone not just FPS fans. that's saying something. 5 stars for a perfect collection, possibly the best HD collection this year!if you're question is \"is it worth it?\"the answer is simple and easy \"Yes it is!\"UPDATE: it seems Doom 1 and Doom 2 have Online MP as well as offline split screen.I just found this out today as I began playing and got an invite froma friend, I was shocked we were co-op (ing) the campaign together. just too bad they Removed this option from Doom 3 but still a superb package of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

This is a traditional 2D platformer from the people who invented the platformer, Nintendo.  Similar to recent releases like Super Paper Mario, Bionic Commando Rearmed, and Mega Man 9, this game goes back to the roots of what made gaming fun back in the 80s, the levels.  Holding the Wiimote sideways, you use the traditional button layout to control Wario, and shake it to release coins from enemies and money bags.  Another cool feature of this game is the excellent hand-drawn animation from Japanese studio Production I.G.  Not only do the animated cut scenes look great, but the in-game animation of Wario and especially his enemies is amazing to watch, and enthralling to play.  If you remember the good old days when gaming wasn't all about the polygons, then this one's for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

I was really excited though that while it \"can\" be an FPS, it can also be played as a 3rd person shooter.  I had no problems at all, I really loved that you can create and customize your own character.  I prefer to play as a character I create rather than some predetermined character which is usually a generic looking white guy.Anyway, I was really pleasantly surprised by this game.  I took a risk on it, unsure of whether or not I would like it but I really did.  Theres good and bad though, so here's my thoughts, first the bad:1. The main quest is pretty short I think and you can knock it out quick, but you don't want to because one of the drawbacks of the game is that once its done, the game is done.  There's no freeplay after that last main quest mission.  I would have liked to have been able to go do more exploration or quests after the final main one or even to talk to people afterwards to find out their thoughts at that point.2. There's a real lack in different bad things to kill, I count roughly a dozen or so different creatures and that's about it and you see most of the different creatures pretty early on in the game, so there's really not a lot of surprises.  Further, I found I could kill pretty much anything I ran up against fairly early in the game, so the stuff didn't really get more challenging.3. I think there's a disconnect between levels and experience.  Either theres not enough levels or you get thru them too quickly.  I found myself maxed out at level 20 maybe 1/3 of the way thru the game.  That meant that I didn't see any motivation or benefit really to continuing to do certain activities as there was no experience.4. There's a real limit to how much cool stuff there is in the game.  Again you see the same stuff over and over and there's not a lot of rare items, nor do the items get better as you progress.  That would have made more sense to me, better weapons and armor as you progress and encounter harder and harder foes.  Also, because of this, I found myself with lots of lots of caps (in game money) with nothing worthwhile to spend it on really, this took away motivation to bother to gather things because I didn't need the money anyway.5. I get that there's only so much they can do, but still, every house seems to have the same internal layout, the tunnels all look the same inside, etc, just the configurations change.  Its not a big problem, but its consistent with weapons, armor and creatures in terms of a lack of real diversification.6. There's a lack of diversification of faces, maybe a dozen or two and so you tend to see the same faces over and over, especially on the raiders.7. Shooting when you're not in VATS, especially on a PC is a little tricky, but not impossible.8. I would have liked to have seen some romance options, but that's just me, a romantic at heart.9. It ends kind of abruptly.  I would have expected the last mission to be a really tough battle royale kind of a \"the biggest test\" of the game if you will, but it wasn't.  That's consistent with the fact that nothing really gets any harder or more challenging throughout, it all kind of stays at the same level even as you get slightly better weapons or much better skills or attributes, really it just gets easier as you go so for me, the end was really easy and I wasn't expecting it to end when it did.and the good:1. I really enjoyed this game and felt sad when it ended, I think because it really does have a great story that draws you in and truly makes you feel connected.2. The voice work is nice.  Liam Neeson plays the father.  Malcom McDowell as the President, both have amazing voices.3. While more diversity of music and radio station choices would have been nice, I did enjoy listening to the music and news of Galaxy News Radio.  The old style music was a neat contrast against the wasteland.4. The world is very big and the environment is beautiful and detailed.  I would have liked to have seen it be a fully usable/destructable world like in some other games, but walking around, especially at sunrise or sunset, this is a really cool looking place with lots to see, lots to explore.5. Tons of little side quests ranging from small nothing things to bigger things, so plenty to do.6. I liked the karma system and how people respond to you is based on that.  Its not something you set in a window like I'm going to have X karma and be evil, its more based on your choices which I think is how it should be.7. VATS makes shooting pretty easy and the slow motion of body parts flying everywhere when you hit something is a neat bonus.So for whatever shortcomings the game has, I highly highly recommend it.  It plays out more as an RPG (role playing game) than a pure shooter.  You're not just shooting at stuff with no reason, this has a real story and you're a character in a world that you feel connected with.  There's a bunch of DLC add on content too but I didn't buy into that.  So if you're good with 3rd person shooter games (or 1st person) like GTA, Saints Row, Dragon Age, etc, you may very much like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"CJC","summary":"Good game but a little frustrating","reviewText":"The ability to run around the Disney worlds that we've grown to love is a very cool feature to this game.  To interact with characters from the movies, with a few Final Fantasy characters thrown in, is pretty dang cool.  The game has some nice visuals and decent bosses.  The camera angles are fairly worthless and the controls are bad enough that you'll never quite get used to them even after hours of play.  The weaponry is decent and the choices are definitely there.  My only real complaint about the game is that Square Enix doesn't really allow you to use their characters throughout the game.  The Disney character are the only ones you can use.  I kept wanting to rock it up with Cloud from FF7.  But this sadly isn't really an option.  You only really get Donald and Goofy as companions.  But aside from that, great game and definitely worth playing all the way through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

There are five multiplayer maps, which look allright, butyou're not able to traverse the enemy spawn point, as they're elevated platforms with no steps.The mechanics are similar to the campaign, but not much effort was given to your damagerecognition to others (you often wonder how many bullets it takes to drop them) and charactermovement smoothing (this game has last-gen players in a modern setting, the distant framerateof players is appauling).  Once I figured the best routes in each map, I enjoyed things more,but now I'm pretty bored because the gunplay just isn't satisfying enough.  The melee attacksare a joke, and believe it or not it takes precision and luck to pull it off (unless you get someonefrom behind); buckle up for a duel in which both players drop, or at least in rapid succession.Aside from the general violence, the campaign gameplay's childlike, and you may feelthe character models are rotated on swizzle sticks.

This game introduced some staples in the series, such as the Master Sword,a hammer, the hookshot, teleportation, Zoras, and a few others. One of the strong points of this game is that it is easy to pick up for most beginninggamers, and there are plenty of environmental varieties such as an ice lake, a desert, forest, and a steppe. Aside from the controlsbeing simple to master, and those important staples introduced, getting around is not very difficult at all, and the dungeon locationsare pinpointed for your convenience, and the dungeons are balanced in difficulty, though the difficulty increases quite a bit later on.Once the player receives the Master Sword, it does not stop there. One can actually upgrade the sword two times, and it is stronglyrecommended that you do, because the game increases in difficulty, and it will be necessary to have the upgrades in hand for thegame to be bearable later on. The two upgrades are the tempered and golden swords, and the golden sword is necessary to be able todefeat the final boss somewhat easily.Overall, this is not only the best SNES game to be released, but it is the second greatest Zelda game toever be released, only Ocarina of Time besting this one.

{"product_name":"B0030GBSUC","description":"Yakuza 3 is the next cinematic chapter in the prestigious video game saga offering an authentic, gritty and often violent story set in modern day Japan. Following the events of the previous game, Kazuma and Haruka (his adopted daughter) have left Kamurochoto to seek a new life in Okinawa where they manage an orphanage for children. However, their peaceful life is soon interrupted when a series of events unfold pulling Kazuma back into the shadowy past he thought he had left behind. Making its first appearance exclusively on the PlayStation 3 platform, the rich story and vibrant world of Yakuza 3 lets players engage in intense brutal clashes within the streets of Okinawa, and the pulsating and often dangerous city of Tokyo where only the strongest will survive.","reviewerName":"D. Blizzard","summary":"The Dragon Goes West","reviewText":"Yakuza 3, known as Ryu ya Gotoku 3 (Like a Dragon 3), in Japan makes its Western appearance after two years following the second installment.  Because the Yakuza are the Japanese mafia, more or less, Yakuza 3 has been described as Grand Theft Auto Japan, but the story, and many of the key gameplay elements, are very different from that successful title.  The Yakuza franchise is also very popular in Japan with Yakuza 3 selling 500,000 units in that country alone, placing it second after Final Fantasy XIII and ahead of Capcom's Resident Evil 5 for sales.Story:  If you haven't played Yakuza 2 on the PlayStation 2, it will take a while to fully grasp the story.  It is told from the perspective of Yakuza 3's main protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, a Chairman of the Tojo clan in the Yakuza.  After spending time in jail, and the events of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, Kazuma chooses to raise children in an orphanage as he was.  Kazuma moves from Tokyo and relocates to Okinawa near the beach.  Shortly thereafter, the land the orphanage is on gets embroiled in various crime plots and politics.  The government wants to establish a new military base there, but business leaders, including members of the Yakuza, want a resort on the land as well.  Because Kazuma in currently residing on the property, and many in the Tojo clan do not want evict Kazuma, this sparks backroom dealings, assassination attempts, and outright extortion, to try and get him to leave.  Yakuza 3 takes place in two locations, a fictional Tokyo district called Kamurocho which is modeled after the real Tokyo district of Kabukicho, and the fictional Okinawa district of Ryukyu which shares similarities to Naha's Ichiba Dori.  The cast of characters is quite large and the story can be convoluted as it carries over from previous Yakuza installments.  There are, mercifully, videos included with the game that details events from the previous games.Yakuza 3 is about as Japanese as you can get without actually having to buy a ticket and go there.  The characters speak in Japanese with English subtitles, the fashion and culture is paired very closely with modern-day trends in Tokyo and Okinawa, and many of the locations in the game are inspired by, or are direct copies of, real-world areas.  To keep with the sense of realism, some Japanese brands have their stores or products on display in the game.  These include Don Quijote, which has a store you can buy from, complete with the catchy song \"Miracle Shopping\" which plays in all their real stores, Club Sega which also has arcade games you can play, PRONTO Cafe which you can dine in, Vivi and Weekly Morning magazines, numerous items which can be bought in stores and restaurants that exist outside the game, and many ads plastered all over the Kamurocho depicting real companies.  This is a very Japanese game complete with all the quirks that add to the atmosphere of recreating Japanese areas.Gameplay:  Many people see Yakuza 3 as Shenmue 3 in the West, but this is very inaccurate.  This game takes elements from many different games, but also changes them.  Shenmue was more of an adventure game in a kind of less-gritty Japanese town.  Shenmue's developers, also Sega, wanted to immerse gamers in the story and location, just as Yakuza's developers did.  Aside from this, Yakuza 3 and Shenmue are very different, with Shenmue being more of an adventure where many inane or pointless activities or items to be looked at or used.  This game has also been compared with Grand Theft Auto.  Yakuza does have the gritty adult nature of that franchise, but, unlike GTA, Yakuza 3 has a richer story and a world with much more to do, immersed in Japan.  Yakuza 3 is a type of blending on Shenmue with GTA, combined with a dusting of a fighter game.There are several modes to Yakuza 3.  The main mode you will be spending plenty of time in is the adventure mode.  This is the part of the game where you move around, at first like a tourist in Japan, in the various districts.  Here is where you acquire the 100 side missions, called sub stories, which add character to the game and hitman contracts.  You can also find hidden locker keys and go out on dates with people you meet, for some reason, always hanging out in burger joints and ice cream stores.  You can also spend your Yen and buy items from healing drinks, to weapons, all the way down to frivolous items like rings and magazines.  While exploring, you can also partake in the myriad of minigames, such as the rhythm-based karaoke, Club Sega arcade games, a bowling game, darts, golf, billiards, baseball, fishing, and a slew of other gambling games.  You can also participate in two different fighting tournaments, one under West Park and the other in a back alley near the Champion District of Kamurocho, foot races, and the occasional drinking game.  All of these minigames are well done with the golf game being as full featured as many retail games, only lacking other golfers and a larger number of courses.  Kazuma can also acquire revelations by pulling out his cameraphone, and snapping pictures of an event.  After the quick time event picture taking session, you have to choose from three options about what just happened.  If you pick the correct option, you get a new skill.  There is always plenty to do in this game.Aside from the adventure mode and the full motion videos in the event mode, lies the battle mode for Yakuza 3.  Not being a fan of fighting games, I was a little apprehensive about this part of the game, but the battle sequences are not that difficult to figure out and are not ridiculously hard.  There is a button for punches, kicks, grabs, sidestepping, blocking, and locking on.  Kazuma has a health meter and another called heat.  The heat gauge allows for you to do special moves and can KO most standard enemies outright and heavily damage bosses.  Heat moves are standard special moves, but, since this is Yakuza, you can pick up an enemy and slam him into another or face first into a car.  Kazuma can increase his health, learn new moves, and increase the heat gauge by earning experience, Exp., and leveling up four different areas.  Each of the four areas max out at level ten and require increasing amounts of experience.  The battles are usually against a small party of enemies with some rare boss battles being one-on-one.  The lock on feature is largely useless in most battles as you can only lock onto a single enemy.  Maneuvering Kazuma around the battle arena can be a little tricky as you have to factor in the camera direction and getting lined up properly.  In Yakuza 3, you can also use any item which isn't nailed down to fight with.  Thus, trash cans can be effective at taking enemies out, as can couches, dropped stun guns, street signs, bikes, and any number of random objects.  Every item, both random and actual weapons, can only be used a limited number of times before breakage.  Because of this, it makes little sense to buy and upgrade weapons since they break so easily. Many opponents carry weapons into battle so you don't have to buy any.  You can simply KO an enemy holding a baseball bat, pick the bat up, and swing away against the remaining enemies.Misc.:  I was a big fan of Shenmue for the Dreamcast and was eager to try Yakuza 3.  This game captures the immersive nature of that previous game very well while fleshing out a very grown up, if not convoluted, story.  Although the game is loaded with minigames, secondary stories, and even romance at love hotels, it is not the exact title released in Japan February 2009.  To meet certain deadlines, and to make the game a little more relatable, and in some cases, less offensive, to Western audiences, certain content was cut.  The Japanese trivia game was removed since few Americans or Europeans know contemporary Japanese trivia like \"Which famous band played on which Japanese Sunday morning show?\" along with other obscure questions. Another element taken out was the hostess clubs.  The concept of these clubs are totally foreign to many audiences but there was a lengthy sub story surrounding these clubs which had to be removed.  Strip clubs, however, still exist as does the two host clubs tied to the main story, Stardust and Canal Grande.  The erotic massage parlor minigame was also cut, as were the Mahjong and Shogi games.I really enjoyed this game, despite the barrier to entry, mainly not having played the first two Yakuza's and not knowing any of the characters or back story.  Yakuza 3 caught me up fairly quickly and I at least had a vague idea as to what was going on with everyone.  The sub stories do vary widely in quality and scale, but really add to making the game feel like a living world.  Like every game, this one is not perfect.  For me, the most irritating factor with this game is the random battles.  At first, they were quite fun, once I learned how to handle Kazuma.  However, as they dragged on, the battles became grating and I could only play the game for a short while because of them.  The battles, which can take place in large public streets  filled with pedestrians, police, and security cameras, are against the Japanese version of the white suburban rappers or pudgy daddy types in sweaters.  These battles would be frequent, fighting on one street, then, three blocks later, fighting again.  Occasionally, they would be against the slightly more difficult Yakuza but usually they were not.  These battles are quite easy, more often than not, none would lay a finger on me or cause very little damage.  When these battles are over, I usually got a worthless item, like comfy soles or charcoal, which can be used to upgrade weapons which, in turn, are totally unnecessary to buy.  By chapter nine (Out of twelve) or so, the absurdity of these battles really set in.  They were nothing but speed bumps keeping me from doing sub stories or other, more fun, activities.  To recap,  here you are racing through Kamurocho to your next date or sub story, run into some Eminem looking dude throwing signs, wait ten seconds or so for the battle arena to load, which, if you're becoming increasingly annoyed always takes too long, hit six buttons to take out one enemy then do it again over and over, finish the battle, get a stuffed toy, run a few blocks and do it over again.  If these battles took place on side streets or back alleys, or were not as frequent, I would have no problems with them.  By chapter eleven, I had enough and decided to complete the main story.  I liked everything with the game, except this one thing.On the more technical side of things, this game runs at 720p, and looks ever so slightly dated.  It's not too bad, but it lacks at times.  The full motion videos are well done and are highly detailed.  The voice acting is top notch and I think it was a good idea not to have English voiceovers.  Some people may not like reading subtitles, which can be turned off, but with a game so immersed in Japanese culture, anything other than the language in which the game is set, would be a serious blow.  The music is also well done covering everything from standard orchestral, to rock, to Enka, to J-Pop, and J-Rock.  The soundtrack is worth buying as many of the songs are quite good, even if you don't understand some of the lyrics in a few of them.  I competed the game in 36 hours having leveled up all four areas to eight, finishing 68 sub stories, and playing, not high scoring, all minigames.  Even after all that, I still only had 30 percent completion.  As for trophies, get ready to play this game for many, many hours.  Trophies favor completion, you have to perform all 100 sub stories, some sub stories go away as you complete chapters, get the high score in all minigames, find keys to the coin lockers, and beat the game on the highest difficulty setting in addition to other equally involved tasks.  Most trophies are bronze and expect to spend over 100 hours doing everything with multiple playthroughs.  Only the most dedicated fans, or obsessive trophy hunters, should even think about getting platinum.  This was a great game and is suggested for anyone who liked Shenmue, Japanese culture, or rich and lengthy games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"The Bayonett is Dead, long Live the Mini-Chainsaw!!!!","reviewText":"Once upon a time, the next generation of consoles was released and the world waited eagerly for some titles it had been promised. Of those, some were not what had been promised, some were stray bullets that hit and sometimes missed, and some were landmines that people couldn't help but feel the effect of. Enter the long-dead utopia called Sera and the heavily-armed disease called the Locust Horde, and enter the otherworldly Delta Force and the once-imprisoned Marcus Fenix as a counterpart to said menace.The bayonet is dead. Long live its replacement, the mini-chainsaw.When I first saw that skeletal cog I was intrigued and pushed forward. This threw me headlong into a story about interpersonal worlds and about the struggle a world was engulfed by, introducing both The Locust Horde and the Cogs in Delta Force. At first it seemed like the game would be complex, too, but the way the game takes time to ease a player into the game really helped with the learning curve. Utilizing both control sticks and allowing for full use of cover and weaponry, it seemed like everything would keep gaining momentum throughout the story. It did, too, and I was glad for it.  The more I pressed myself the more I saw how things looked, noticed how well the controls handled, and how beautifully the variety of weapons would work. You have four weapon slots with some interchangeability, and the quick press of a button can make you spray an area wildly, take cover, or use the chainsaw at the end of one of your weapons. This led to a game that easily surpassed most of the tactical 3rd person pieces of flair that are hailed with armadas of praise, notably powered by the Unreal engine and showing something that I both recognized and didn't at the same time.There are quite a few modes of play here, a good gaming experience waiting to be had (I'm discussing single player because multiplayer is always whatever people want from it), and a story arch worth playing. The AI you work with isn't totally terrible, either, with them laying down suppressive fire when they need to and sometimes taking bullets that were meant for their commander. That isn't to say that they are without their flaws; too often they stick their heads in the way when the timing couldn't be worse or they end up wounded and need you o come and help them out. You, yourself, are your own keeper in a lot of ways; you have a symbol that pops up on the screen and, as it turns terribly red, you turn terribly corpse-like. While you help your buddies out and give them rudimentary commands they don't always do what needs to be done, and some of the enemy movements are smart enough to flank and nail you.Combine that with burned out building husks and you have a pretty piece of time-killer.This is one of those games that works because it seems to keep giving. The enemies don't do annoying things like respawning, the checkpoints come often enough that you don't have to repeat things too often, and the difficulty is reasonable (unless you lay on insane - then you asked for it). I keep thinking the 3rd person genre is dead only to be stunned by something I want to play like this and that is a good sign.Constructive weapon design, intuitive enough design on motion, meeting bizarre creatures and introducing them to shells that blow them into tiny bits; even if you don't father a child like that, it is hard not to love it. Recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2007"}

The graphics really show off on 360 you can tell that you're xbox is a monster when it shows you what it can do graphically and gameplay wise. All the new cars are pretty and the paint shimmers on them in the digital sun. The driving mechanics are lacking pretty bad in comparison to previous GTA games, It's kinda hard to drive fast and stay in control any more (especially in corners) but its still nonetheless entertaining. The city is big, sprawling and alive with all types of digital people, i've yet to see all of it. The min-games are even better with the addition of darts, bowling,drinking (driving drunk is fun! In this game I mean) and Im glad to see pool is still there. It seems like they based the aiming and shooting system off of Gears of War which make it really fun to shoot undesirables.

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Morally and Thematically Complex","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed III is a melting pot. It's both a level above and away from the previous iterations, and it's going to alienate some people. It has a new protagonist, a number of entirely new features, some improvements, and some problems.This review will be long and I will try to keep it in a cohesive order. Apologies for any tangents.The game opens right where AC: Revelations left off, after a few minutes of cutscene summarizing the events of the past games. Once into the Animus, the game opens in Britain, not what I was expecting. Depending on how many non-story-related things you let distract you, the first three sequences of the game can take as little as two hours, or as many as (???). This is both good and bad. Good because the game takes the time to establish the characters, which causes we the audience to emotionally connect to what we're doing. Bad, because I don't know about anyone else, but after the first few hours I started to get confused, as I thought the game's protagonist centered around a half Mohawk Native American, and a Brit. Maybe that was common knowledge to other people, but I try to stay away from information regarding games before they are released.I have heard a few people say that the entire story leading up to where it shifts focus to the protagonist is a tutorial, but I disagree. The opening mission in the opera house is a tutorial, after that we stay with the same character because it is necessary to establish who he is, what he's doing, and why it matters.Before getting into the features and improvements/problems, I would also like to address the issue a lot of people seem to have with the protagonist, Connor. It's true he isn't very a very likeable person, but to me, characters can be unlikeable and still be interesting. That's how I feel about him anyways. Through pretty much the entire game he is angry at many different people and groups of people. One of the things I think the game succeeded greatly at is establishing that Connor is on his own side, and he's pretty much the only one on his side. In the game there are seven British-controlled forts in Boston, New York and the surrounding wilderness. Once you eliminate the fort's captain and raise the \"American\" flag, you get a cutscene showing the Redcoats leaving the the Patriots taking control of the fort. But once the Patriots are in control, they still show as red on your minimap, as though they are the enemy, exactly the same as the Redcoats. It's a small thing, and it was very confusing to me at first, and then you realize that from Connor's perspective, who is participating in this war only to try to protect his people and their land, anyone who disregards what is most important to him is an enemy. It comes across really well in the game, and I understand that to be the main reason (among others) that he is usually very angry or impatient with multiple important historical figures who have been lionized by mainstream American politicians and education systems.Coming back to Connor being unlikeable, it is worth mentioning that Altair starts off as being very unlikeable in the original Assassin's Creed. He starts out very arrogant and little better than a murderous thug. Over the course of the game though, his arc sees him realize his mistakes, and fundamentally change as a person, thus becoming a better person and more likeable. Connor likewise has an arc, but it's more subtle, and thus easier to gloss over. As previously stated, whether or not a character is likeable, I hate sloppy writing and poor characterization. When people do things that don't make sense it bothers me, far more than Connor not being as charming or as funny as Ezio, or not having such a noticeable shift as Altair. I understand why Connor is the way he is, and I have absolutely no problem with him. Ubisoft spoiled us with Ezio. I mean, he got two and a half AC games, and Brotherhood especially saw his arc fully realized. Connor is a more complex character, in a more complex socio-political setting, and I would encourage people who are dissatisfied with him to give him another chance.The same is true of the story. One of the things I really enjoyed about the main story was how all of these important historical figures were humanized. George Washington wasn't seen giving epic and inspirational speeches before murdering a thousand Redcoats with only his wig. Just the opposite in fact, it's more shown how he was kind of an ineffective military commander. Not to say the Assassin's Creed games are factually accurate, but I was definitely worried about bias in the game, which I saw absolutely none of.There are two new features to the AC franchise, being the ability to hunt in the wilderness, and new naval battles at sea, which, to reiterate almost universal sentiment, are awesome.The latter aspect could be a game in itself, but the best part is it's not. Firing a broadside into an enormous man-o-war and watching its hull be devastated, taking cover as they barrage you, taking out the enemy's masts with a chain shot, or destroying schooners with the swivel guns, pretty much the entire thing is incredibly fun.The former new feature, hunting, reminded me a lot of Red Dead Redemption, and that's fine. Obviously this is slightly different as you're more likely to use bow or blade in this than a gun, but it's very similar in most other ways. Once in the wilderness (known in-game as the Frontier), it's very easy to get lost in it and just wander around killing wolves, bobcats, cougars, bears, rabbits, hares, foxes, elk, deer raccoons, etc. For people who enjoy it even more than I do, there are also snares and bait that can be used to lure unsuspecting prey into an ambush.Aside from the entirely new features, there are a number of changes that have been made to combat, free-running, and free-climbing. Some work, and some not so much.Combat has very much been simplified, and to me, not for the better. I didn't really see a need to simplify it further, and now it feels more like a button masher than it ever did. There is obviously some sort of way to achieve kill streaks or combo's, but over forty plus hours of gameplay I never found it. It doesn't seem like previous games, where you press the attack button at evenly spaced intervals to keep your combo going, now it's more just like press attack a bunch of times in a row `til you've killed `em real good. It's a minor complaint really though, since the ways in which you can attack people is still quite varied, and even if it takes less finesse now. It's worth noting at well that your kills are different depending on the surroundings. If you're near a wall you're more likely to incorporate that into your finishing move, which is neat.Free-running has been improved, and has incorporated trees into the climbable geography. In general, climbing and running along an uneven path along rooftops or ledges is easier now and there is a much smaller likelihood that you will jump somewhere you don't intend. I'd say it's about as good as you're going to get, since there will always be at least a few issues where you want to jump down to the ground but you continue along an elevated path instead. No complaints here.Onto the problems the game suffers from now. Clipping has always been an issue in the Assassin's Creed games, but it was more noticeable this time around. It wasn't a constant annoyance, and to me unless it's terrible and constantly distracting, it's pretty much a non-issue, but if you absolutely can't abide it, you'll probably be more annoyed than I was.I had two instances of glitching over forty plus hours of play, which also isn't bad. It's probably more than all the previous games, but considering it's a new engine, that's not bad at all.For me, I think what is probably the biggest problem to me is the new cover system. Connor can now hide among tall bushes or grass or what have you. But there is no sort of camouflage or anything, so while the game does read you as being concealed, it is ridiculously obvious that there is someone hiding right in front of you in the grass. I realize this series is not supposed to be the most realistic, but it is laughable how bizarre it looks when enemies aren't detecting your presence and you're clearly visible.Along with the cover system, the map is also a step down (it seems) from all previous games. It is not topographical, and thus two points on a map might be separated by a huge valley, or mountain, or whatever. Synchronizing at high points also don't fully reveal a map, leaving you to explore areas on your own to find treasure chests, feathers, almanac pages and all the rest. This is good, as it forces you not to be lazy, but it's bad because I'm lazy and would rather just have the game do the work for me. You can still buy maps that show all the locations though.The end of the game was mildly disappointing, but to be honest, but it was pretty clear after Revelations that the present day story was going to fall short of expectations. As with all long franchises, the expectation of the outcome of the story is crushed under its own epic nature. It wasn't a surprise, and they probably did as best they could, but I was kind of left wanting.Overall though, I was and continue to be very pleased with the game. It has some problems, but for me those were hugely outweighed by the things in it which I enjoyed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

At times the graphics can seem a bit blocky and not very fluid.  I was dissapointed at the way the space ships took off, because it looks the way they did in Jedi Knight (they kinda just lifted up in a straight path, stopped for a second then went forward ina a straight path).  Other than that this game is all gold.  As many other people have said, the death animations are awesome.  I like how now the Force Jump is holding down the jump key.  It makes it easier.  Force saber throw is now just the secondary fire for the lightsaber.... the Multiplayer experience is awesome, just like in Jedi Knight. One thing I'm afraid of though is hackers.

Using a variety of upgradable weapons, take the fight to the alien army of the Black Viper and reclaim Earth for Mankind in single-player or 2 player co-op mode.","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"The Challenge That Improves Gaming","reviewText":"CONTRA 4 is on the verge of becoming another Citizen Kane --- its greatness is being tarnished by its reputation.  What is this game's reputation?  According to Amazon reviews, CONTRA 4 is the pinnacle of toughness; therefore it either won't appeal to the masses, or is fundamentally flawed.  CONTRA 4 fans have defended the game's challenge because it's designed that way.  I'm gonna side with the supporters on this one.First off, what is the game?  Simply put, it's a side-scrolling shooter where you kill bad guys and aliens.  CONTRA has been that way for 20 years, as have hundreds of other franchises.  This \"fourth\" game (it's actually the 12th one, I think) has some throwback levels & bosses to pay tribute to the series' history.  But it never feels stale, because there's always a barrage of enemies trying to stop you.  NEW SUPER MARIO BROS did the same thing, and just like the platforming plumber's DS debut, CONTRA 4 is fresh and familiar.There are 9 levels --- three are the \"3D\" perspective that first saw in CONTRA back in 1987, one is an on-rails vehicle stage, and the other five are traditional side-scrolling.  You shoot, jump, and make your hands sweat.What separates CONTRA from other shooter franchises is its level design, music, weapons, and enemies.  There's practically no story in the game, and other than the style, nothing distinguishes CONTRA from other shooters.  If you're looking for a conceptual reason why this series has been a leader in the genre, there really isn't one other than CONTRA is more fun.  It's a toughie, but I'll address that later.Unlockables for CONTRA 4 include:Challenge Mode - a variety of short but difficult tasks.  Examples include finishings levels with no ammo, time limits, and/or no civilian casualties.Unlockable Characters - other than their appearance and voice, each character plays identically.NES Games - the original CONTRA and SUPER C.  Each have two screen ratio options.  One fits the game to the DS screen.  The other improves the resolution, but makes you use the shoulder buttons to see the top or bottom of the screen.There are a few other things like an interview, comic pages, and the history of CONTRA.Alright, now onto the main event!  What is the deal with the difficulty of CONTRA 4?  Let me confess that I think having the Easy Mode only have 7 of the 9 stages is kinda cruel, especially because it isn't exactly \"easy\".  Other than that minor gripe, my take is that CONTRA 4, while it might frustrate from time to time, is tough for all the right reasons.  The controls respond perfectly, I've found no glitches, each challenge is beatable, and it's always a blast to play.

Well, lets drain resources from other planets by cracking them open like eggs and exhausting all resources. You are Isaac Clarke, part of the Maintenance crew stationed on Ishimura - a ship that has been overrun by Necromorphs - disturbing alien creatures. There is more to this story, but I'm not one for spoiling anything.Dead Space is a third-person action shooter/survival horror. Most of your time will be spent traveling through creepy corridors and fighting many Necromorphs which seem to just pop up out of anywhere. There are plenty of jump moments throughout this game, if you like tense edge-of-your-seat games then this is definitely for you. Dead Space breaks up the monotony a little bit by throwing you into zero-gravity areas that allow you to jump on ceilings and walls thanks to your anti-gravity boots.One cool thing about Dead Space is the fact that there is no HUD (Heads Up Display). Your health is displayed on the back of your armor and your guns display how many shots are left. There are areas in Ishimura called \"Benches\" that allow you to upgrade your weapons, Stasis (which I'll talk about in a second) and Armor. Ishimura also has shops so you can purchase ammo, health packs, stasis packs, weapons and more.The primary method for killing Necromorphs is by blasting them with various weapons. Each weapon has a primary and secondary firing mode. You can also stomp  on them, or punch them. Stasis is a cool feature where you can aim at a Necromorph (or other fast moving objects) and cause them to slow down drastically. This is especially handy because it makes killing the enemies much easier - however you are limited in the amount of statis energy you can use before you have to use a stasis pack or find a recharge station.When disposing of enemies it's best to go for the limbs rather then the head. Different Necromorphs have different weak spots, some die easiest if you blow off their arms, some are easiest to dispose if you blow off their legs. Head-shots are not a guaranteed kill, in fact often-times it results in a Necromorph becoming aggressive and blindly attacking you before it finally dies.Now for the review, I'll rate each aspect of the game independentlyGameplay 8/10The gameplay in this game is pretty straight forward. You run around in different corridors blasting away at enemies that tend to jump out at exactly the wrong time. It's a lot like Doom 3, but with more in the way of weapon upgrades. Stasis adds a cool element to the game allowing you to slow down the enemies and stop them in their tracks. The anti-gravity areas are pretty neat at first but they became my least favorite aspect of the game, it just feels a little bit tacked on (and it makes me dizzy!). The 10-16 hours it takes to beat this game is just enough time, any more and it would become too monotonous. The gameplay is solid, but it's far from breaking new ground.Sound 10/10The sound in this game is amazing. When you hear the heavy horror movie style music you better watch out! There are creeks, bangs and whispers heard throughout the game. The voice acting is solid as well.Graphics 8/10As far as textures, lighting and visuals are concerned this game is top notch. I will ding it because the environments are very repetitive. Most areas look about the same, which becomes a bit drab after awhile. Animations are done very well!Controls 7/10The controls are pretty solid for the most part. It does become a little bit of a hassle at times because of the button combinations, a lot of actions are done by pressing the left trigger and something else, at times it just feels awkward. This becomes more of a non-issue the more you play. Overall the controls are pretty solid.Story 5/10While I wont give away anymore of the story I will say that it does start off well but it didn't hold my interest too well. This game has a suitable enough plot, but it's far from gripping. I don't care though, I just want to kill more Necromorphs!Overall this game is pretty solid. This game will take you 10-16 hours to beat and if you're like me and don't really care about achievements then a single play-through is probably enough. Because it doesn't have a high replay value I would suggest renting this game, you can easily beat this game within a week.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

True, the graphics and sound really convey the feel of a futuristic damaged vessel teaming with mutated life forms. Special credit has to be given to the lighting and background audio - it all works really well and I also liked the totally functional but minimal HUD. You feel like Ripley must have felt at the end of Alien - never knowing what's around the corner. Fabulous atmosphere.As with the demo, the main character always being to the left still is strange; sure I realise this is so you can see what's in front of you but sometimes you need to see what's on the left of the screen and you can't. A part where you are dodging asteroids on the hull of the ship totally showed how flawed the 'guy on the left' mechanic was (see Batman Arkham Asylum for a great example of how to deal with this though).At first I was totally getting into the game, everything was thrillingly spooky and downright made me jump initially. But drudgery soon kicked in as I discovered that it's just a case of go to room X, press button Y then return to room Z. Nothing really changes as you progress in the game except when silly minigames are placed in front of you or 'quick time events' pop up, presumably to break up the monotony. The mandatory defend your ship from asteroids was the breaking point for me - seriously it played and looked like a flash game. And bad guys pop out at such frequency that they know longer hold a surprise. Their constant 'boo mammy' appearances become so predictable it loses its spark very quickly and clearly a very basic AI is covered by cheap scares. Other frustrating parts of the game didn't help - no ability to jump... seriously? And why do futuristic space suits only manage to have 60 seconds of breathable air? Laughable really.I loved System Shock 2 - truly a scary game for its time but the only thing I found scary in Dead Space was how boring it all quickly became.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2010"}

But it didn't dissapoint and no its not goiong to leave that much of an impression but I don't think that is what the makers was shooting for and what they ended up with was something different, something new, something fun and something that could be a movie if someone picks it up.

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"J.  Martin","summary":"Nice addition to the series, but has its share of flaws (Warning: possible spoilers).","reviewText":"I'm not completely new to Civilization-style games. My first was Call to Power 2. In some ways, I see Civilization V as a significant improvement, and in other ways it seems lacking. While Civilization V features vastly improved graphics, achievements, cloud saving, in-game instant messaging capability (no need to alt-tab :), diplomacy interface, combat animations, online gaming/multiplayer, and a whole lot more - it falls behind a little bit on the content side of things.Lets start with the bad things first - game content problems. Recalling my childhood years spent playing Call to Power 2, I seem to have vague memories of the game including approximately 3 historically/geographically based scenarios being provided for free with the game, apart from the obvious and ever present ability to play on randomly generated maps with various fundamental properties you choose. These scenarios were things like playing as Alexander the Great, complete with more or less historically/geographically accurate maps, special units, etc, which helped to add variety and spice you can't really get from randomly generated maps. Unfortunately, this is a category in which Civilization V is rather deficient, providing the player with only ONE scenario with the initial purchase of the game. But don't worry, they have another couple scenarios you can download - for additional payments of ~5-8$ or so. This leaves me with the bitter sense that the devs actually probably made a lot of these DLCs ahead of time, choosing not to release them with the initial game - only so that they could later sell them as DLCs... selling the game to you in pieces to milk it for more cash.The other downside in terms of content is that Civilization V seems to include far fewer technologies and units to explore relative to Call to Power 2. To put it in perspective, Call to Power 2 included gameplay from stone age times (roughly similar time era as the earliest-possible time era you can choose to begin the game in in Civilization V) all the way up to the most distant and intriguing of science-fiction based futures... long after the year 2000. Sure, many of the units, wonders, buildings, and forms of government to play with in the game were fictional - but many (if not all) were based on real science-fiction scenarios and concepts, and had a pretty rich intellectual appeal to them in some cases.Civilization V, in contrast, has the tech tree stopping completely by the time I tend to reach approximately 2050AD in game. After you research nuclear fusion and particle physics or whatever the options are, the game simply provides you a generic \"future tech\" research item that can be researched repeatedly to increase your score... and doesn't provide you any new buildings, wonders, or units beyond that point. When reaching this point, the most technologically advanced units you can build are a woefully unimaginative giant-killer robot, for those pursuing military victories. Perhaps the only majorly interesting science-fiction oriented wonder you can construct in Civilization V is the interstellar colony ship to Alpha Centauri - permanently expanding your Civilization beyond Earth for the first time, and achieving a \"Science Victory.\" While that is quite interesting, Call to Power 2 simply included a vastly greater quantity of Sci-Fi based technologies you could explore when going into the future era. The decision to have the game simply end there without the ability to go further into the future just leaves the game feeling somewhat incomplete to me, which is slightly disappointing. That said, the space-launch Science Victory is definitely a nice feature.On a more positive note, Civilization V has taken many great strides over its semi-related predecessor games. The graphics and combat animations are phenomenally improved. It's really quite nice and satisfying to see your units engaging in combat, and the depiction of things like nuclear weapons and infamous world leaders in Civilization V is just worlds better looking than similar units/diplomacy windows in Call to Power 2 or for that matter in Civilization IV. For one thing, in Civilization V, you will actually get to sit face to face with the leader of the opposing civilization, such as Augustus Caesar of Rome (who amazingly actually appears to speak to you in Latin in the diplomacy window!) While Civilization IV may have had animated leaders in diplomacy screens, the game-art and sense of refinement just wasn't there. Civilization IV had a cartoonish sort of appearance to it, while Civilization V has a more refined and immersive art style - a vast improvement over Civilization IV.Civilization V also includes a variety of convenient features many modern gamers would probably demand and appreciate, like the ability to instant message people from within the game without needing to alt tab, browse the internet, save your games to the cloud on the internet (allowing access to them from any computer you have the game installed on), a variety of achievements for some added replay value, and more.People considering purchasing Civilization V who are having second thoughts thanks to the large number of 1-star reviews should bear in mind that many of the game's low reviews are actually due to anti-DRM activists complaining about the fact that Civilization V is the first in the series to include Steam. No doubt, there are legitimate criticisms to make for Civilization V, but the vast majority of these negative reviews appear to be people criticizing the game for its inclusion of Steam support, rather than for the actual game content... and indeed many make note of the fact that they haven't even bought or played the game yet. Therefore, I would suggest those who think they might be interested in Civilization V should forget about all these reviews on Amazon and just give the game a try! (There is a free demo available on Steam.) After you've tried the demo, you should have a much better idea of whether or not the game is a wise purchase or not.Overall, Civilization V is a pretty good game with more modernized graphics, a better art style than the previous version, and a variety of convenient new features. I'm pretty glad I purchased it (at the price of approximately $25) some time ago. That said, due to concerns with the DLC issues I mentioned above, I would suggest waiting for the total price of the game plus DLC (at least a couple of the currently available scenarios) to make itself available for less than $50. In any case, you should at least go give the free demo a try!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

Unfortunately, I can confirm that I have NOT gotten any better at FPS games...as much as I love to play them. Therefore, Resistance 2 is simply easier and shorter than Resistance 1.One thing is for sure: Resistance 2 is at minimum as much fun to play as Resistance 1. So why, you may ask, would my overall rating of the game be only 3 stars? Because Resistance 2 was: 1) too short, 2) too easy and 3), most disappointingly, did not allow for co-op play (like Resistance 1 did) of the campaign. There are indeed on and offline multiplayer co-op modes...but not of the campaign. And that's a big minus for me. I played through the campaign of Resistance 1 in co-op mode several times with my kids and friends and that option is sorely missed in R2.Don't get me wrong...playing both on or offline co-op in R2 is indeed very fun. There are various missions that you can set up and play with friends. But it's just not the same as playing through the campaign...it's just not.The campaign consists of (only) 7 levels of exhilarating battles against a plethora of creatures that you use a plethora of weapons to defeat (and they'll use most of them against you too). To really put the campaign plot of the game in context (if you care about the plot), it's well worth the visit to the official Resistance web site; there's a ton of story there that I'd bet 90% of the people who start the game are unaware of. For me, the story helps me \"get more into character\" for the game, and R2 picks up right where R1 left off.Your campaign weapons in R2 are as plentiful as they were in R1. HOWEVER, and I actually liked this better, you are only able to carry 2 weapons at a time instead of stockpiling every weapon you come across. Most of the R1 weapons are back...some slightly modified. The Bullseye Mach II is readily available right at the early stages of R2 versus only in the very latter stages of R1; it's very useful on the enemies that you encounter most throughout the game. You also get several mean weapons that are new to R2 (like the Wraith and the Chimaran Marksman). I found that grenades were not as key to survival in R2 as they were in R1. There were level in R1 that were virtually impossible without grenades; I didn't find that was the case in R2.Perhaps the most improved feature of R2 is the health system. In R1 everyone who's played it will recall the annoying system of having to find health syrums throughout the game. R2 has moved to a moreCall of Duty 4like system where finding cover immediately replenishes your health. Although, now that I think of it, this probably contributed heavily to how much easier R2 seemed than R1.  The controller's aiming and meleeing schematic was also rearranged a bit to be more Call of Duty-like.Again similar to R1, there are no maps in R2, which at times was frustrating. Let me tell you that if the phrase \"the best route is not always the most obvious ever applied to trying to get from here to there\" it applies in this game on more than one occasion.Finally, unlike R1, in R2 you'll never be required to control any vehicles or Chimaran craft.If you just like wasting nasty beasts without regard to a story, then my concerns about a short game and no co-op to enjoy with others won't affect you as much as it did me. Rest assured, the story won't help you beat the enemies or evade the barrage of defenses that will be fired at you by them. I'm glad that I played R1 before R2, and I recommend starting with that (and R1 is cheap on Amazon tooResistance: Fall Of Man). But playing R1 first certainly isn't necessary to enjoying R2.Resistance 2 has an M (mature gamers only) rating just as Resistance 1 did. There's a bit more cursing in R2 than R1, but both Resistance games really only deserved T (teen) ratings. But I'm perhaps a bit more liberal when it comes to what I think will warp a kid's mind, so you'll need to use your own discretion if you're thinking of this as a gift for someone under the age of 18.Multi-player is cool too. Multi-player is not like co-op where you play missions with friends. In Multi-player you battle (with or without your friends) against other onliners.You've been promoted from Sgt. to Lt. Nathan Hale. As far as you know, up to the start of R2 you've been the only one with a Resistance to the Fall of Man. But things may be different than what you thought before being introduced to R2's Doctor Malikov...very different. Prepare for some surprises and some serious battle.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3V0","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Hidden Gem","reviewText":"The current climate of the gaming industry is very detrimental to games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I will say that this is my first experience with the XCOM series, as my gaming career began a scant 13 years or so ago. I'm taking a wild guess, as I can't really remember how old I was when I seriously began playing video games, but 7 years old sounds about right. Add this to the fact that I am a console gamer through and through. I have played a few strategy RPG's and the most recent example that comes to mind is Valkyria Chronicles. I am very much into FPS and action heavy games. I like fast-paced, chaotic games. But, I also have a very soft-spot in my heart for strategy games. These are the games that truly get my blood pumping. The idea that I am in command of an elite force of soldiers, who live and die based on my decisions, is very nerve-racking. For as much fun it is to play the role of the unstoppable one man army like in Call of Duty, or Solid Snake in Metal Gear, sometimes it's more rewarding to control a band of soldiers that are very much expendable. If you lose a soldier, the mission does not end. You have to cope with the loss, and move on. One thing that I am particularly surprised with is the range of emotions that I feel when I am on a mission. If I lose a soldier, it isn't like losing nameless grunt 1. I lose a soldier with a name and a unique set of skills. Rookie Hernandez was my very first soldier to become a Squaddie. Now he's a lieutenant, and he's become a pillar for all my missions. Make no mistake, you will lose. You will have soldiers die, and you will have a hard time completing missions. You aren't an unstoppable force, you are a facing an enemy that is organized and very deadly.The graphics are pretty great, and the music is very fitting for a game of this type. As I understand it, this game is long. This is a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill 6-8 hour game. This is game that is worth revisiting, and worth pouring time into.I never say this, but I am genuinely excited for what DLC Firaxis has to offer.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

In retrospect of how they had the movie tie in with the video game, I simply don't get it.  Okay okay, let me explain.  BloodRayne the video game is hugely better than the movie, so those movie goers who saw that first, don't let they shirk you from playing this game.  That being said, I was very pleasantly surprised at how fun this game was to play!Naturally you're playing as BloodRayne and she's more than just your average vampiric character.  She's what they call a Dhampir, half human, half vampire.  Naturally her character concept is incredibly alluring.  Anyway the game starts with a video sequence of her being watched by the Brimstone society and her essentially getting recruited.  Now this is all taking place a little before World War II era.  Which obviously doesn't mesh with the movie, because in the movie she got involved with Brimstone in the Middle Ages, how you screw that one up is beyond me?  Anyway, the game starts you off in Louisiana hunting down some anomalies.  This is basically a training level so you can get used to using BloodRayne and your mentor Mynce is there to help you out.  After you complete this section of the game your real mission begins, but five years has passed.  The Nazis, on their rise to power, made a group called the Gegengheist Gruppe (Anti-Ghost Group) or GGG and Rayne's mission is to essentially bring this group to their knees.  You get a list of targets to assassinate and you are sent through a large amount of harrowing missions!I should forewarn any parents of how violent this game is, sorry just a good thing to throw out in a review.  You do dismember limbs and heads from enemies.  I was even surprised at all the harsh language in the script.  To be honest the swearing seemed out of place and forced, so it had a fairly goofy quality, but that's from an adult perspective.  So parents might want to know about these specifics because the target audience for this game is most certainly not young children, you've been forewarned.I thought this was going to be a fairly quick game originally and I was pleasantly surprised it took me a lot more than six hours to beat, which is kind of what I was expecting.  Unfortunately the story and missions get a little monotonous towards the end, because basically you have to assassinate the people on your target list.  The only variation is the location you're in.  Some of the areas are hard to navigate and you can get lost kind of easily because the way through isn't very obvious all the time.  The worst part was jumping up to a certain level in the middle section of the game.  Basically you had to jump upon a series of small ledges to a very high location in order to get out, which was a horrible area to play, but I will admit it was very different.In terms of game controls, it does take some getting used to.  Rayne can jump really high, which is a boon when you want to get somewhere tough!  However, sometimes this can prove detrimental when you want to land someplace very specific, in flight she is sort of hard to control and you don't get much say.  Rayne also has the ability to walk on something as thin as power lines (which is necessary in the Louisiana chapter).  Like I mentioned above it's a boon, but it's not always easy to land on those power lines.  Other than this general movement controls are fine and smooth.  The camera can be rotated, which is a must for any newer game as far as I'm concerned!In terms of combat this game can handle itself pretty well.  I was surprised at the assortment of weapons I could choose from.  Naturally Rayne has her arm blades (my preferred weapon in this game), but she can also pick up guns and you can use stuff ranging from pistols to rocket launchers.  I wasn't expecting this, but I thought it was awesome.  So if you have an enemy standing in water and you don't want to cross or get close you can shoot them from a distance.  Rayne also executes automatic combos, which I suppose takes away from some of the challenging factor a game like this could use (however, I think it's challenging enough as is).  However, your bloodlust can rise, in which case Rayne goes into a sort of berserker mode and she's nigh unstoppable!  As you go further in the game she also levels up a bit and her attacks become stronger, but you have no control over that so it's not like a role playing game by any stretch of the imagination.  I also like the way they handled the health/damage issue.  If you get damaged all you need to do is suck some enemy's blood and your health meter will go up.Added into this game is a whole series of different cheats you can enter to either help beat the game or make interesting things happen.  Like you can get god mode or you can get one that adds extra dismemberment.  I don't really like the way they made the interface for the cheat code section because it's fairly cumbersome to use and if you turn one on then have to stop playing the game, when you start your game up the next day you need to re-input all the cheat codes.Ultimately I thought this game was a lot of fun.  I have to take off a star because after a while the Nazi story-line, regardless of how interesting, does get rather mundane.  I think the writers should've made a series of missions of the length of the Louisiana game, but with slightly different objectives each time.  Rather than having a short introductory section with Louisiana and then having an incredibly lengthy assassin mission with the same objectives/concepts for the rest of the game.  I think this would have split the game up a bit more and gave it a less monotonous feel.  The writers did try to break it up fairly well, especially when you ended up going to the castle stronghold, that part was actually really fun, but again, the mission objectives were the same as the prior level.  The game is definitely challenging and I will admit I had to turn on god mode a few times to get through certain sections because I simply couldn't find my way out!  If you can beat this game with ease not on god mode, you are a better gamer than I and I salute you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2008"}

I played it back in its release days on the XBox platform. I've long since traded in for an XBox 360, and was curious to see how well it had held up.The most important thing to know here - the game plays just fine on the XBox 360! I had no problems at all playing on the newer platform. And even better, SWBII still provides great, engaging gameplay.Where many games from the XBox era feel dated and old on the XBox 360, Star Wars Battlefront II manages to hold your attention and keep you engaged. The training section is great. It avoids the \"shoot at targets. Now move to station 2\" start-up that many games force you to slog through. Instead, you're tossed into the action, get to try out a variety of options, and you keep wanting more.The game provides a wealth of combat styles. You get to run around on foot with guns, with a variety of character classes. You hop into various vehicles and explore locations which show an attention to detail in their design. There's space combat as well, if you've always wanted to fly a TIE fighter.It's amazing to think this game was released in 2005. So many games from 2005 are painful to play - and yet this one draws you in right from the start.Now, of course, the game does show its age. The graphics aren't quite as sharp or crisp as the latest games, as one would expect for a game designed for the XBox. Certainly there's areas of the game that you might wish played more smoothly. We've learned a lot about game design and user interface in the intervening years.With all that being said, though, the game absolutely deserves a \"classic\" title. If you're a fan at all of the Star Wars storyline, and if you enjoy combat style games. I highly recommend you give Star Wars Battlefront II a try. You might find you play it far more than the latest releases on the market.Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

You fly through the air and do some of the craziest tricks you'll ever seen in a racing game. The environments are gorgeous and lush. You'll travel all around the globe to race through a series of ten circuits with about 4 challenges each. You can create multiple bikes that specialize in speed, tricks, control and other items. The only down side is that their are a limited amount of challenges that sort of just repeat themselves throughout the game. Theirs the standard 3 lap race. A challenge mode where you have to get the highest score doing just tricks before you run out of gas. And lastly a  5 lap race with a much shorter track that relies more on technique than tricks and speed boosts. You'll have tons of fun unlocking new levels, characters, bike parts, and save slots for new bikes.The only other con I can think of is the soundtrack choices and how the game doesn't allow you to use the new XMB function to play your own music while playing a game. Also a lack of trophies is a bummer. Everything else about this title is stellar and nobody expected the best racing game of the year to come from Disney.

I like action.When I saw this game on the shelf at first I kinda just blew it off. I didnt even hear of it before it was released.

Graphically superior with an incredible sound design (If you have a good sound system, I recommend turning it up) which adds to the incredible tension. This game is fast paced while throwing a few puzzles in here and there, but not too repetitive to turn off an impatient gamer as myself.As I said earlier much of this game and its theme are borrowed and they dont pretend to be 100% original (see if you can find the reference to Dr. J. Carmack in your travels). However, they have made some gameplay innovations. Whether you are receiving an audio or video message, viewing the map or scrolling through your inventory, you never leave the games enviornment... it shows up in a small holographic screen in front of you. If your lost and need to know where to go next, you simply click a button and your suit lays a temporary path (think laser pen) for you on the floor. Your gauges (health and oxygen) are actually incorporated on the back of your suit.

If I wanted to read a comic book of this game I would have went out to buy one. They have a few new vehicles you can drive but they are just different variations of tanks/helicopters. There is also more area to cover in this game it feels like with 3 islands. I would say its about the same as the first game. It has more polish then the first game but the plot is worse so it kinda evens out.If they make a third game (which doesn't seem like they will because this one looks like it didn't sell well) they better really work hard on getting a good story together and keep it polished up otherwise it wont really be worth it.

The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Technohead","summary":"Sweet...

Whether you end up liking the ending or not, ME3 is a quality game overall. My qualms with the conclusion are secondary points when considering the quality of the game start from to finish.If you haven't playing any of the Mass Effect games, I highly recommend playing the series in it's entirety. There is just too much that is overlooked without experiencing ME1 & 2.

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Dark, Bloody, Addictive Fun!","reviewText":"The story of the Lord of Terror continues with 5 new player classes, amazing spells and effects, an incredible musical score, and very addictive gameplay.The story begins on a darker note...the town of Tristram, the very location of the first battle with Diablo has been stricken with a terrible fate, as the very hero who defeated him seems to be harboring a great curse...and as he travels eastward, this 'Dark Wanderer' leaves behind him a wake of evil, spreading throughout the lands.Enter: The heroic Paladin, the mighty Barbarian, the mysterious Necromancer, the quick and agile Amazon and the elementally-powered Sorceress.  These 5 character classes each have 3 unique skill 'trees', all of which have powerful skills that your characters can perfect, which lends easy customization of your character(for example, you can have a Necromancer who is unmatched in raising the dead to do his bidding, or one that is a master of dark spells, or a mixture of both).  Tons of enemies block your path, with literally thousands of magical, unique, and 'set' items that players will find themselves hunting for throughout the game.  Battle.net capability makes Diablo II a very entertaining experience both off- and on-line.The Paladin is the definitive choice for those that want to lead a party.  With a tree of deadly attack skills, and 2 trees of 'auras' which enable the paladin to enchant himself and other party members with defensive or offensive abilities, he is a force to be reckoned with.  A great choice for those who favored the warrior in the first Diablo but wanted magical skills as well.The Barbarian is easily the most formidable fighter in the game.  Immense strength and agility make this character very hard to kill.  His skill trees include 'Battle cries' which can be used to power himself and party members, as well as cause damaging effects to enemies.  He has a tree of attack skills, which include the ability to 'bash' and knock enemies back, dizzying them, or leaping into a group of enemies with enough force to scatter them.  his third tree consists of 'Masteries' which allow him to increase his ability to wield sword, mace, and axe class weapons, as well as the ability to search corpses for potions and treasure.The Amazon is a quick and nimble warrior, with the mastery of spear and ranged weapons.  She also benefits from spiritual abilities and excellent attacks.  The perfect choice for those that were fans of the Rogue class in the first Diablo.The Sorceress is no different than the Sorcerer of the first game, save the fact that she learns her elemental magics: fire, ice, and lightning on each individual tree.  Players can choose to master one tree, or blend all three to have an excellent elemental warrior!The Necromancer is by far the most unique and mysterious of all the classes.  He has the 'evil' ability to raise the dead, making the corpses of his foes into skeletal slaves!  He also benefits from 2 trees worth of magical attack spells, which do incredible damage if trained properly.  However, the ability to raise undead minions to do your bidding is the best aspect of the Necromancer.  It may seem at times that you are being SWARMED by an unprecedented number of enemies on screen at once.  all you have to do is continue to train your summoning skills, and soon you'll have your enemies on the run with your own personal army of the undead!These 5 diverse classes alone are worth playing the game over multiple times.  When you beat the game, a harder difficulty opens up, and new, more powerful items and creatures are yours to discover!The cinematics are breath-taking.  Blizzard once again delivers by giving us excellent quality and story telling.  Each Act is followed by a cinematic that spans anywhere from 2 - 5 minutes long.  Some of the events that occur in these cinematics will send chills down your spine, especially the end of Act IV....The gameplay is VERY addicting, and you will find yourself looking at the clock and watching hours go by as if they were minutes.  There strange thing is that it is nothing remarkable...go, kill, do quest and gain experience.  Perhaps themost entertaining aspect is the multiplayer, which keeps the game going no matter how many times you've beaten it.  The bottom-line: GET IT.  You will LOVE it.  A great story, great voice acting and tons of items and creatures to discover make this game well worth your time and money!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2001"}

In general, the graphics are good, cutsie, and intended to be on lines with the wii mii's as far as being smoothmapped and cartoony. For what the game is, you get what you need out of the graphics.Gameplay: For those who are not aware of exactly what boomblox is, Boomblox is simply an assortment of minigames on lines with Rayman: RR (replacing grossness and strangeness with cuteness). Each minigame is build on blocks, which take on a variety of shapes and sizes. The games are sorted in easy to follow menus. The variety of the games follow a few \"trends\". Either you toss bombs at structures or people to blow them up, toss tennis balls or the slightly larger bowling balls to knock down structures, or pull blox out of the structure. Some games are time based, others are point based, others are based on using the least amount of turns to knock down everything. The games are fun, and range from Jenga Like games, to protect the castle type games, to a blox shooter. There are essential 4 different types of themed backgrounds, such as jungle and med evil castle.  The games are fun and can be addicting, especially if you are determined to get a gold in each game. When you start, nothing is available and everything must be unlocked, a bronze is the minimum required to do as such. Many of the games are really just puzzles, where you try to figure out the weak spot(s) that enable you to knock down everything or pull out everything in the given time. Most of the games are really simple to do, and anyone teen level and higher will figure out most of the puzzles instantly. Occasionally, you will find one that you just can't figure it out. Other times, your success has to do with more dumb luck (as to where the explosion goes) than actual skill.Story: The game does actually have a story. In adventure mode, you face 4 of these stories, they consist of a small cartoon scene from beginning to end that roughly explain why your doing what you are doing with the blocks. It is weak in story, and really just done for a laugh.Multiplayer: It consists of a pretty good multiplayer. People can verse each other for the best score, or work together to get the best metal. It is one of the main reasons to get this game in my opinion, as it has several games that can be played easily as a group.Overall: The game is a fun game, potentially addictive, and best played with a group or party. It is fun for kids. The reason it scores a 3 instead of a 5, is that it really just doesn't have much to it. The story mode is lacking, and is just loosely done as a joke more than for a reason. The games are limited, and most of them are similar, not really offering much in the ways of variety. The single player has absolutely no re playability, once you solve the puzzle, there is little point in replaying. The one exception is the save the castle modes, where you try to protect your jewels from oncoming attackers. But most of them are so easy you will get a gold on the first try. Multiplayer has a little more re playability, but since levels don't change, once you complete one, there is very little point in returning to it. This game has tons of unlockables, since just about everything needs to be unlocked on every level, including a large amount of the pieces you can put in the 'build it your own' mode. However, it is a simple and easy game, and once your done playing and beating all the levels(maybe a 10 hour endeavor assuming you don't get stuck for 2 hours on a specific level)there is nothing else to the game to keep you interested.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"AMD","summary":"Not the Best Zelda but it still Must be Played","reviewText":"First, I'm not going to compare Skyward Sword with Ocarina of Time as there is a big difference between the two games, also since 1998 things have changed.Speaking about the franchise, Twilight Princess was my favorite one, it has all the gaming aspects I was hoping for. However, if you have played Twilight Princess on GameCube only you might find skyward sword little awkward. The reason is, it takes time to adapt to the functionality of Wii Mote Plus, I can understand the frustration of some people about how you should swing the sword, using the shield and moving Wii mote which result in big time fatigue!! Absolutely difficult for people with disability, but in the bright side it demonstrated the full potential of the motion plus. Twilight Princess had the same controls build up but with limited motion dependency. Skyward sword was designed to utilize the capability of motion plus.This Zelda is different; it is not like the old dungeons and the complex temples you used to know, not like the open area while you roam with your horse exploring the land. This game centralizes on the sky as its title implies, and your adventure will always start from the sky and ends in the sky.If you are willing to experience a new Zelda, don't miss Skyward Sword. Overall, controls are the biggest problem, once you get over it, and you being open enough to experience a new trend of Zelda, you will enjoy this game as any other Zelda games stood for its magnificent title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

The frame rate is good, no tearing and the install is clever, it only caches data if your HD has room. The Pawn system is brilliant, you make a main pawn which people online can use and earn you rewards. You can also barrow two other pawns that others have made. So you can make a great party and change it anytime you want. Your main character can also learn other classes and use other equipment starting at level 10, so if you don't like using a sword, change to a mage or strider or assassin, etc. Anyhow, the star of the game is the combat. The boss monsters are epic and you really feel a great sense of accomplishment every time you kill a large beast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

The LEDs are a gimmick: Sorry Logitech, most people aren't going to be switching between the modes enough for the colors to be useful.2.) The buttons are hard to use without moving the mouse. That makes about 3 of them useful if you are doing anything that requires precision aiming.3.) The mouse occasionally jumps around.

Sure, some of the maps are meh, and I'm not too sure about the token/pointstreak system being an improvement over the old system, but it's a interesting change and certainly manageable.

The original was scary and this is just the same with even more monsters longer game and great new monsters. I like how they added new gameplay elements like fighting in space with huge monsters and the train level is extremely epic with a stand out story other games need to study the gameplay design to this because its marvelous I think only Assassins creed Brotherhood is the only other game that has the best of both worlds like this. A huge frightening story at 2o hours and a great multiplayer where your are both 4 isaacs fighting the beasts or you are the beasts hunting the humans being the kiddies as i like to call them jumping on their heads and splitting them open. Plus they added a free map pack which is great to keep supporting the game and you level up your online character to get new stuff a la call of duty. And also the ps3 version has the exclusive dead space extraction which is great with 2 player coop me and my girlfriend loved it and she rarely plays games much like rockband littlebigplanet but the ps move controls were excellent. 3 games for the price of one and now at 39.99 is like a steal.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBT8","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"Falls into its own traps","reviewText":"People Can Fly gave us the outstanding painkiller, a no-holds-barred run'n'gun in the tradition of Serious Sam and Unreal, so when they announced they would be making a current-gen shooter that would once again thumb its nose at the sissy mechanics of modern shooters in favor of hardcore fragging, gamers were psyched. PCF even released Duty Calls, a 1-level parody game mocking the conventions of Call of Duty- a pointless experience system, needless game mechanics, and an overwrought REAL WORLD PLOT.Sadly, Bulletstorm itself jumps into modern gaming conventions with both feet. While touted as \"not another cover-based shooter\" it is TOTALLY a cover based shooter- get shot a few times and the game will warn you (invasively) to seek cover. Why? So your auto-regenerating health can kick in OF COURSE. There's no cover button, but when the game makes you use cover anyway, that kind of makes things worse. Levels are painfully linear yet still rife with invisible walls, a condition made more apparent by the fact that you cannot jump. Space becomes a movement action button, causing you to dash, and, when EXACTLY in the right place, vault over scripted obstacles. But good luck REACHING the sweet spot when scenery and your NPC helper's collision boxes make rapid navigation of the environment a huge hassle. And are there totally automatic cutscenes where you must pointlessly press buttons to progress? YES THERE ARE. A lot of them. There's also a totally unwanted experience system that serves to break up the action.For an ostensibly humorous game, Bulletstorm also kind of fails. It may be meant to be comedic, but the story and characters come across more as serious in a late 90s kind of way- perhaps funny in a metatextual sense, but not very. Comparisons to Daikatana are not inappropriate, although your helpers in Bulletstorm require mercifully less babysitting.In Bulletstorm's defense, it is a lovely game. Animations are very well achieved, the music is good, and lighting is great; and since it's Unreal technology the requirements are quite acceptable. And the combat controls always do what you want them to, although the leash, the kick, and their associated bullet time are all mechanics we've seen before. I actually found myself preferring to not use the leash because it jars the camera around and suspends your aiming, but the game forces it upon you for a number of puzzles.PROS:-Looks sexy-Good combat controls-Music and other audio are decentCONS:-Embraces nearly every worthless convention of the modern shooters it claims to be an antithesis to-Awkward motion made more so by tight, restrictive levels-Vague, generic plot could belong to any shooter made in the Voodoo generationFINAL THOUGHTS:-Buy Painkiller instead","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"zombies, zombies, and more zombies","reviewText":"Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is sometimes called the forgotten installment in the Resident Evil series.  Other people just call it the least popular.  Let's face it: all the attention went to Resident Evil 1 and 2 because those were the games that were revolutionary.  Those were the games that not only brought realistic, never-before-seen gameplay and 3D survival horror graphics to the original Playstation, but the Resident Evil series also made it *very* difficult for any imitators to come along and try to overtake the popularity and success of the Resident Evil series.  Capcom knew they had something amazing with this series, and that's why when video game fans think about being scared and trying to stay alive, the Resident Evil series *immediately* comes to mind.Now, here comes Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but, at the time of its release, this game didn't receive NEARLY as much attention as the previous two Resident Evil games.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that video game fans were anticipating the upcoming release of the Playstation 2 in the year 1999, or maybe people thought the Resident Evil series was starting to run dry.  Nah, I highly doubt that second one is true.  Nemesis was just the Resident Evil game that didn't really stand out, despite the many positive reviews of the game that I'm sure you've read about.  Yes, the game is fantastic, and the fact that so many people would agree with me is more proof that the Resident Evil series was nowhere NEAR ready to be forgotten.  Not in this lifetime, baby.  It's just that Nemesis wasn't really a drastic jump forward in terms of innovation, like Resident Evil 2 was.I honestly believe, if you have an appetite for running around destroying zombies, that Nemesis is the *perfect* Resident Evil game for you.  I was completely taken by surprise as I continued to progress through the game and notice that the amount of zombies and other familiar enemies are absolutely LOADED almost everywhere you go.  Zombies left and right!At the very beginning of the game, when I looked inside that giant item box beside the typewriter, I couldn't believe Capcom was so generous as to give me more than enough ammo right from the beginning.  I really mean it- you receive a LOT of ammo from your item box.  After beating the game, I had a ton of ammo leftover.  Now, I realize people will probably look at this as a bad thing, and complain that lots of ammo greatly decreases the challenge and makes progressing through the game a cakewalk.  They'd also have a point if they wanted to complain that giving you loads of easily-available ammo straight from your item box doesn't really define \"strategy game\", since you aren't spending the majority of your time dodging enemies- you can simply walk up to them and shoot them and have *more* than enough ammo available for the next enemy you encounter.  They'd be absolutely correct, on both counts.Capcom is also pretty generous when it comes to those green herbs and first aid sprays.  You can find plenty of them throughout the game, just sitting around on the table or floor, making the challenge level go down even more.  Oh, and let's not forget that, in addition to having lots and lots of ammo generously offered to you, you also receive a few awesome weapons such as a machine gun and a shotgun straight from the beginning of the game.  Another thing- when you pick up, for example, handgun bullets, you actually receive a LOT of ammo.  I believe in Resident Evil 2 each of those orange packs of ammo contained about 15 bullets.  In this game, you receive, and I'm honestly not kidding, around 40-50 bullets per pack.  Capcom made running out of ammo something you will NEVER have to worry about.However, in a few ways, the challenge has been increased from Resident Evil 2.  For example, remember how slow the zombies would walk up to you in Resident Evil 2?  You could practically stand next to them and blast away, and not have to worry about taking any hits.  In Nemesis however, zombies are almost RUNNING at you, forcing you to turn around and allow yourself room to shoot.  This is awesome, because you won't know which zombies are slow pokes and which ones are speed runners until you see one on screen.  Oh, and thankfully a quick turnaround button has been included.  Press down on the directional pad + the run button to turn right around.  Very convenient button.This game is also much scarier, not to mention much bloodier, than the previous Resident Evil game.  The last time around, only *sometimes* zombies would break a window and try to attack you (along with crows, dogs and other dangerous enemies).  In Nemesis, not only do windows break all the time, but zombies can pop out of cars, jump down from buildings, and other incredible things.  Many times you will be caught completely off guard when it happens, too.  This is awesome.I love the fact that you actually go back to the police station from the previous Resident Evil game for a short while.  You go back, grab some things, and then head back out to the streets again, where most of the game takes place.  Interesting how the music from the main hall of the police station has remained exactly the same, and it's also interesting when you notice certain places blocked off that were very important to access in the previous game with Claire and Leon as your playable characters.You're probably wondering why the game is called Nemesis.  Well, Nemesis is the name of an enormous, persistent and dangerous maniac that, throughout the game, constantly tries to attack you.  He can either smack you with his arm, or shoot rockets at you.  This doesn't make the game as hard as you probably think, because most of the time you can simply run away from him. However, when he appears, get ready to either fight or run away.  Don't stand around too long.  Decide quickly!I want to set the record straight about something.  People writing reviews for this game will probably tell you that Nemesis chases you around from the beginning to the end of the game.  That's not exactly true.  Yes, it's true he will be a problem for you until the very last level but, you should know that Nemesis does NOT follow you around for the entirety of the game- he just appears *sometimes*, messes with you by following you into rooms and whatnot, and then he disappears for a while.  If you haven't played this game yet, some reviewers will have you convinced that Nemesis will be chasing you around ALL the time -nonstop- and this is NOT true.Probably the biggest challenge comes in the way of puzzle-solving.  Now, think back to Resident Evil 2.  What did you have?  You had three or four puzzles to solve.  And they were EASY!  In Nemesis, let's see, you have 10-12 puzzles to solve, and some of them simply can't be completed unless you're either a really excellent puzzle solver, or you look the answers up on the internet.Yes, I'm talking about that famous, dreaded water puzzle near the end of the game.  Honestly, the best way to successfully finish the darn puzzle is to just look up all the possible solutions on the internet, and then write them down.  I found seven different answers so far.  Don't feel ashamed for having to look up the answers.  This is one of those rare nearly-possible puzzles that you shouldn't feel bad about for not being able to understand it.  Don't get me wrong- once you find out how to do the puzzle, it's easy.  But if you happen to be mostly familiar with Resident Evil 2, and think you can go through the game on your own without a walkthrough, looking up help will probably be the best idea when you finally arrive to this puzzle.  You'll be glad when it's finished!The game has a good storyline too (well, by video game standards anyway) with excellent, action-packed cutscenes located throughout the game.  If you consider yourself an action-type person, you will enjoy some of these cutscenes a LOT.  I guarantee it.  One of them has something to do with a helicopter, and you'll love watching it.Also, Resident Evil 3 includes an infinite amount of ink ribbons to save your progress, and you now also have an option to skip over dialogue conversations and cutscenes by pressing the select button.  You didn't have this in the last game.Overall, I give this game the highest possible score you can give, and that would be 5 stars.  It truly deserves it.  The fact that you have to face about TWICE as many zombies this time around, and the fact that you are basically outside roaming the streets the entire time are major, major highlights for the game.  These streets are deadly.  Pick up this game today, and have fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2006"}

That has been the case with great games that really showed it like Excite Truck and the dramatic The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. With all that said about great games, mini-game excitement has also delivered too with the return of the Mario Party series. It has been almost 2 years since the franchise had its last game on the Nintendo Gamecube, and worked like a charm by being innovative and fun for all ages. Now, it has finally made its way onto the Wii, but is it worth the wait.Mario Party 8 for the Nintendo Wii is a wild and addictive game that brings out a simplicity for gamers young and old alike, as you unlock and play over 70 minigames that are easy and fun to play. There are also a few new additions here too, as you can also unlock players including Blooper, the sea squid from the Super Mario Brothers games, and Hammer Brothers, which recently returned in a great set of guest cameos in Super Mario Strikers and Mario Superstar Baseball. The graphics are delightful but the gameplay is definitely what brings the game to its success, as you use the Wii remote to play in games like waving a magic wand and using an energy ball to strike Bowser in a one on one showdown, punching a statue to smitherines with a boxing glove, or using it you are shaking a soda can and creating a gusher in one of the duel minigames. You can also use your Mii characters that you've created from games like Wii Sports and have them play in the Star Carnival and play games like ping pong. The graphics are delightful and the sound carries well throughout each of the boards, but the gameplay really does deliver for new Wii owners as well as die hard Mario fans alike.All in all, Mario Party 8 is a delightful game that welcomes the party franchise Wii owners well. I loved what the series brought out for so many years, and I know that this edition does a great job as well. Considering there are so many great games coming out for the Nintendo Wii like Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree, this one is definitely a wonderful addition to your Wii library.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo players; A- for Multiplayer ActionOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2007"}

Saenz","summary":"My most anticipated game of 2012, a kick ass!","reviewText":"After playing the beta and the full version for hours... I want to share my thoughts with you.First of all, I want to say that I am a huge ssb fan, I even bought a Wii just to play that game. So my expectations regarding Sony's brawler were high, thankfully the game is a sleeping beast very fun to play.STORY 7/9:The story or singleplayer campaing is the weakest feature in the game. Comparing to its competition, the singleplayer story mode will not fill your expectations, having the oportunity of making a cool and unique story mode. the developer, superbot, has created an arcade mode instead, pretty similar to tekken, but less polished. There are no animated cutscenes (expect for the 15 seconds mini cutscene between the character's rivalry), no cgi animated ending... instead the prologs and endings are static 2d art images;Although since this is a barely new franchise, its quite understandable that the game doesn't have a strong story (superbot polished the multiplayer and gameplay), perhaps further sequels will give us something better in this aspect, non the less you would expect something better coming from a first party game.PRESENTATION 9/9:Game graphics are superb. Each of the characters are very detailed and resembles perfectly, no jaggies, very good anti aliasing, light effects and shaders. The stages are also very well detailed. In this aspcet all stars does a great job. Although I'm substracting 1 point because the game menus and screens don't have the same level of quality; they do their job, they are easy to use, but there is no eye catching in them. Also, you can play ranked 2v2 matches with your buddy (he can be on his house playing online, or sitting with you on the couch playing together, although there is no multiple psn singups here :( )GAMEPLAY 10/10:Here is were the cherry in the cake is. The gameplay is superb, the game is super fun to play and the more you play the more you don't want to stop. The game mechanics are different from SSB, there is no heath bar or meter, instead the game is based on kills made by character's specials, in paper this seems to be not that fun and challenging, but is quite the opposite, there is a high level of satisfaction when you kill someone with your special power, more if it is a level 2 or 3 were you had to earn a lot of action points to fill your special bar to perform them. Actually is more satisfying than SSB in my opinion. Multiplayer plays extremelly well (no lag from day one). Each character is different to use than the other, no as generic as SSB, more like tekken where every character has its own unique fighting style.REPLAYABILITY 10/10:There are tons of content to unlock, from costums, badges, to minions. There are many customizable multiplayer modes for you to try and play with friends and the online modes are incredible. The game is so fun to play that every mode is great. The arcade mode will help as a tutorial and practice (even though these modes do exist as well). You can play this game for hours and hours and never get bored.OVERALL: 9/10This game is a must for every playstation and brawler fan. Haters gonna hat, wii users will hate it since its SSB's competition. Do a favor and play it before judging, this game may suprise you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"GameMaker","summary":"Good for games, worthless for media","reviewText":"First and foremost I got the Xbox One to play games on.  And for that, it is fine.  I'm enjoying Dead Rising, and have some other games pre-orderd, and I'm very excited about the system for such games.But then there is the &#34;media hub&#34; part...owch.  Like I said I mainly bought this for games, but I was hoping to at least replace my blu-ray player, and try out the new media features of Xbox one.  I re-wired my DirectTv box to go through Xbox One, I went through their tutorials and set up the guide, I took the voice control tutorial and played with that for quite a bit.  Then after a few days I gave up on it all, put my directv tuner back to going directly into the tv, and turned off all those features on the x-box.  It's half-baked at best.  The interface is terrible.  It takes twice as many controller-clicks to accomplish the same things that I could do simpler with my tv, cable, and blu-ray remotes, and while I love the xbox controller for games, it's not fun trying to tune your tv without a numeric pad.  And while the voice stuff is kind of fun and exciting, when it comes right down to it, it rarely does what you want it to.  The headset that it comes with is perfect for a 12-year old boy, but certainly not an adult.  Also it had real problems tuning the channels that I wanted (in HD) from the directv tuner.  It seems to me like Microsoft had really grand plans, some really good ideas but shipped it before they really got it working.  Shame, but I'm not too surprised given Microsoft's incompetence with a lot of their other products.So 3 stars for me.  5-star for games, and 1 star for media.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"dan boon \"dan\"","summary":"What a disapointment","reviewText":"This game was the bigest disapointment of the year. Every one kept sayin how great it was and all this hype about the best rpg of the year. Well you were all wrong this game is garbage. I hated it and it was soo dam boring i never even wanted to keep playing. But the worst part was that i actualy paied 50$ for it when its worth about 15$.I will even admit the story was prety good and it had a good idea but the story didnt stick together and the good and evil part was stupid. As much as i wanted to keep going evil its like it wouldnt let me even if i helped 1 person for money it still brought my meter up to the good side, it just didnt go good with the game.And the combat was horible it was the worst fighting ever it was like fighting on a ps1 game it was clunky and cheezy, and it seemed like i just kept doin the same moves over and over. It did sound cool that you could turn into a demon but that was even lame when u you get it, like who the hell wants to turn into a big ass ugly frog? The game is just straight up boring and every convo you have its like they make you think about every single answer you give even for the stupid convos , that just gets boring , Well over all it had a  good story but it wasnt enough to save the game cuz this game was lame and boring and too repetitive. I might have liked it more if so many people didnt hype it up so much and i didnt pay 50$ for the dam game. My advice if you didnt play it , rent it or wait till it gets cheaper to get it.

The game was a blast, the story was fun to follow and the scares were not as jarring as the first but still fun - the opening scene was one of the coolest I've ever seen in a game, very intense! I played through the game three times (Normal, Zealot and Hardcore) so I really got a feel for the game. The weapons are fun to use and upgrade, the graphics are really cool and the necromorphs look as gross as ever. The few new enemies in the game were a fun addition as were the weapon changes - but my trust plasma cutter and force gun were my go-tos for all three play-throughs.While some of the major set pieces were great, I'm a little disappointed there wasn't more variety in all of the levels and scares. There's a difference between the tense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere of the first game and the \"oh, something is behind you that you didn't notice\" approach to the second. I think it's really an issue of newness. Like Isaac Clarke, I knew what to expect this time around and it might have taken some of the edge off. Then again, hardcore mode is a white knuckle, tense experience but I think that has more to do with losing a few hours of progress to a stupid mistake than a scare issue.Overall, great game, I loved it and I hope they come out with a third.Pros:Great storyCrisp graphicsTight controlsZero-G is much better to navigateCons:More of the same (that's not really a bad thing!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

Kim","summary":"Can't help it but Disappointed","reviewText":"Gosh,,it's really painful to give the game 4 stars (actually I would give 4 and 1/2 stars),which I thought I was gonna fall in love with like I have with the first Metal Gear Solid,, I just finished the whole game and left with this feeling of 'incomplete' sorta,, The best thing I loved about the first MGS is that there was this very strong sense of being fulfilled, satisfied, completed,, However, I couldn't feel as same as I have felt with the MGS when I finished the whole thing..Ok, may be that's so because of high expectation, perhaps too much expectation I had for the game. What you have to understand here is that this game itself is such a great game, I wouldn't hegitate to give a perfect score,,Only if I haven't played the first Metal Gear Solid. This second 'masterpiece' is a very solid game. You can definitely witness the power of PS2 with the much enhanced graphic and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.I really liked the MSG 2 (but liked the first one better) where it shows the sign here and there that the team of Hideo Kojima have put so much effort into this very game. The enemy soldiers have gotten tougher, which gives more challenge and because of clear graphic, using first person mode to use your weapon becomes natural. What I missed from this second installment is that I felt it would've been better if there were more boss fighting like the first MGS.There were also lot of complaints about putting too much cutscene for a game and I do admit that I got the impression that it was little bit overdone (but what you have to realize is that all the cutscene is there to bring this game's real quality up to the expected level, meaning they are there for the reason)I thought there were interuptions here and there where I felt bit annoying (since the first game implemented that where it tells you to push action button to get on the ladder and etc. it was funny in the first game but thought it wasn't that necessary to do the same thing because i'm sure almost everyone has played the first one. it did interrupt the flow of game where the flow of story line is one of its strongest asset of this game) To add little to that complaint is that everytime you are trying to save your game, Raiden's girl friend Rosemary talks about her feeling and love talk. It does add to the game but time to time it took away the urgency and the seriousness of the situation like when you are on the way to save president (but that becomes justifiable toward the end, but not 100% though,,)The game does end in a way where it leaves this open ending, doesn't give this completeness. At least the first game gave a great ending where you can definitely feel the accomplishment of the mission. Somehow the second game leaves this opening too great that I didn't expect that was the ending of the game whereas the first one gave more endings after endings (like when you thought you finally finished the game, then there's more fighting you have to do in the first game)However what really consoled my 'shattered' expectation is that since it leaves this great 'opening' for the ending, I was sure that there would be Metal Gear Solid 3.MGS 2 was like Star War Episode 1, which will work like a good solid ground to build next episode. I sorta wished that if they could work on the flow of game with more 'controlled' cutscene and could bring the climax more dramatically, I wouldn't hegitate to give a perfect score for this game.I still have this impression that they have overblown the twists of the story to top the first game, but can't also deny the hope that the third installment will be surpass the first two Metal Gear Solid because of its 'giving a headache' twist.To wrap it up, the very 'EXPERIENCE' I've felt from the first game was there in the Metal Gear Solid 2, but not as strong as the first one. Regardless of everything I said about this game, it's a masterpiece, you don't wanna miss it. The awesome intro itself is worth buying this game. =)ps: I had so much expectation from Solidus, and I was disappointed to see him.  I was sort of expecting this man, who doesn't talk much, really cool.. but Solidus looked and acted very cocky and someone who's not really worthy of code name 'Solidus'..  I was expecting more of Solid Snake level, but doesn't even come close.  Dang,,where is Snake...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

I m about 10 hours in and have done heres and theres and its extremely addicting as was fallout 3. It does crash but after the first part in Springfield i think it was it didn't freeze to much after that. New weapons such as the incinerator will give you PLEASURE when killing enemy's. I haven't even gotten to the casino's yet just to give you an idea of how long New Vegas will be. The hardcore mode is UNFORGIVING if your looking for a real challenge this is it, I even had to turn it off. I would advise anyone going for platinum trophy to play through on normal unless your that good at games, its just that next time around you will know whats coming. Weapons weapons weapons plus mods mods mods, I am already in love with the new modding system. The story and characters are there if that's what you are looking for but to me its rather boring this time around. Although I haven't had the time to really get into this game. It runs smoothly and will be getting a patch for the crashes and bugs that it has. It is NOT a rip off of fallout 3 geez I wonder who started that rumor. Sure it has the same system as fallout 3 but doesn't ever game in a series follow its previous? If not it would just confuse the player and probably lose sales. So if your a classic single player person this is a game that WILL NOT let you down, if you are coming back or if you have never tried the fallout series.What are you waiting for pick up this game NOW.The best thing about this game is the gambling I can sit there for hours waging my caps until I lose them all or win a hoard. Oh wait maybe the weapons are the best with all their mods, actually this game is to much fun to miss out on everything about it is good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

Hunted for a murder he didn't commit, Jack must draw on his most savage instincts to make his predators his prey.","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Best in series","reviewText":"Far Cry Instincts Predator is a repackaging of the Xbox game Far Cry Instincts and its stand alone expansion Far Cry Instincts: Evolution. There are some minor differences between the two, such as improved graphics, but this is more or less the same game that came out months earlier on the original Xbox. It is important to make that clear right away so there is no confusion over what exactly you are getting.For the main campaign, Far Cry Instincts Predator puts you into the shoes of Jack Carver, a retired Navy commando who now pays the bills by taking tourists out on his boat. After being hired by a woman to take her to a mysterious tropical island, Jack finds himself on the receiving end of a helicopter gunship. With his boat destroyed, Jack must find a way to rescue the woman and get off of the island. Of course that sounds a lot easier then it actually is. You will discover that there are some odd things going on deep inside the jungle, something that an army of mercenaries don't want you to discover.The game's setting is probably the most important part of the game. The entire main campaign takes place on one huge lush tropical island. This setting opens the game up to some interesting gameplay. For most of the game you must rely on Guerrilla warfare since you are almost always outgunned. Hiding in the jungle and sneaking around is a big part of the game. It is possible to sneak up on enemies and perform stealth kills by stabbing them in the back. You can also set branch traps on trees, and then throw rocks to lure unsuspecting enemies to their death. There isn't much that is more satisfying then taking out whole groups of enemies without any of them ever seeing you. While stealth is more of a suggestion rather then a strict requirement, you will have a much easier time covertly taking out as many mercenaries as you can then if you run in guns blazing.That's not to say that there isn't a ton of gunplay to be found in the game. The firefights can be pretty intense at times. There is a pretty good selection of weapons, though they are pretty much what you would expect to see. You have your assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns and more. Jack can carry three weapons at once: a pistol, a medium weapon like an assault rifle, and a heavy weapon like a rocket launcher. This doesn't include grenades or claymores that you can use as well. You can also dual-wield many of the games smaller weapons.Your most effective weapon in the game though is definitely your own two hands. Not too far into the game, Jack becomes a victim of one of the strange experiments going on (this is written on the box, so it's not really a spoiler). The experiment gives you \"feral abilities\" like super human strength and speed. Early on you can essentially rip enemies apart with your own bare hands. As you progress through the game, you are constantly getting new tricks. For example, you will gain the ability to pick of sent trails from your enemies, or run extremely fast and jump incredible distances.You can also take control of a few vehicles in the game. These range from ground vehicles like ATVs to water craft like jet skis. There are even a few hang gliders in the game which you can use to fly around the huge environments. While you can shoot while in the vehicles, driving and shooting is pretty difficult. The awkward vehicle physics can make a lot of the vehicles frustrating to control. You will mostly use the vehicles simply as a way to travel across the big levels.There is also a pretty good variety in the environments. While most of the levels take place in large outdoor jungles, there are a few underground levels as well as a volcano fortress to mix things up a bit. This keeps the levels feeling pretty fresh throughout since looking at a bunch of trees the entire time could get a bit boring. On the PC, Far Cry featured very open ended levels, where you could pretty much pick your own path through the island and tackle objectives in a variety of ways. This seems to have been scaled back for the console game. The underground levels, which last for a good amount of time, are completely linear. The outdoor levels do offer you more freedom then most first person shooter, but they feel pretty linear compared to the original Far Cry game. Perhaps this was due to technical limitations of the first Xbox, but it is unfortunate that one of the best features of the original game has been watered down.Once you have finished the Instincts campaign, which should take you around 12 hours or so to complete, there is the Evolution campaign for you to tackle. It is no big surprise that it is actually pretty similar to the main campaign. It is an expansion after all. This time around however Jack Carver is hired by a woman (again) to help her with some illegal gun-running. As you would expect, things don't go as planned. Shortly after delivering the weapons, rebels attack, stranding Jack on another tropical island. While the expansion is still a good amount of fun, it doesn't manage to meet the same level of excitement as the first campaign. This is mostly because it doesn't manage to feel as fresh.Since this game is set in a tropical island very similar to the last one, the game plays almost exactly the same. There are, however, a few changes in the level design that are worth mentioning. On the good side, some of the levels feel a lot more open ended this time around. For example, early on you will have multiple objectives across a few smaller islands that you can tackle in any order you want by using boats to travel between them. On the bad side, the game has some very annoying jumping puzzles later on that seem to simply be there to extend the length of the game. Also, sometimes there are infinite amounts of enemies that spawn in. It may take a while to realize what is going on and that you are supposed to just move on.There is one bug that shows up pretty often during both campaigns that deserves mentioning. The bug involves locking onto enemies to use your claw attack. Similar to the sword attack in Halo 2, when you target an enemy to attack them with your claws, the game automatically has you fly in a straight line towards your target until you hit them. The problem is that it is extremely easy to get stuck on objects while flying towards your victim. When you do, you will be unable to move until the game gives you back control. The problem is that it takes way too long for the game to realize that you are stuck and give you back control. There will be many times when you will die because of this, and it can be extremely frustrating at times.There is not much else to say about the expansion campaign. It's pretty much just more of the Instincts gameplay with a new storyline. But that is not necessarily a bad thing since Instincts was pretty fun. The Evolution campaign should take most players around 6 to 8 hours to finish. After finishing both campaigns, there is still the multiplayer left to check out.Far Cry Instincts Predator has great Xbox Live support. It is one of the few games to feature an easy to use map editor. It's surprisingly easy to create your own levels. Most of the map editing is point and click, so you can very quickly develop and test your own ideas. When connecting to a game running a custom map, it is automatically downloaded. The custom map editor combined with a good number of retail maps and game types makes the multiplayer experience pretty solid. You could easily spend a good amount of time playing this game online.Overall, Far Cry Instincts Predator is a pretty good game. It is a complete package that features a ton of content and is definitely the best version of Far Cry to date. That being said, if you already own Far Cry Instincts on the Xbox, there is not enough here to warrant buying the game again. You would be better off just buying the expansion separately. But if you have yet to play Instincts, this is the best version to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Why are people so disappointed?","reviewText":"I did not buy this game on the day of its release, as so many people were complaining Bioshock series lost its magic in Bioshock 2. The Rapture city doesn't feel as novel anymore. But now that I have played through with it TWICE, I have to say these folks were dead wrong. Yes, the city, some of the villians and gameplay are similar, but that is why this game is labeled Bioshock 2 and not a new IP. Either way below are the pros and cons for the Bioshock2PROS:-CHOICES, CHOICES, CHOICES: One of the aspects, gamers loved about the original is how you have to make choices in terms of litter sister throughout the game and how it affects the ending. In this one, they have taken a step further and improved this choice system. Not only for little sisters, but also for some other things you will have to make choices. This choices will affect the story (dialogues, cut scenes and ending) to a great degree and add decent replayability to the single player mode.-MYSTERIOUS STORY: The story is suspenseful. It is not as good as the first one, but is still pretty good and will really drive you forward in the game. If you played Bioshock 1, it is certainly a plus; however, certainly not a requirement. Even if you did not play the original, you will be able to understand most of it.-AMAZING UNDERWATER VISUAL ANG GRAPHICS: The city looks as stunning if not better as Bioshock 1. Better yet in this one you get to play UNDERWATER. While it may not sound as thrilling it truly adds great deal of feeling to the gameplay experience.-PLAYING AS BIG DADDY: Initially you will be somewhat confused, but this gets to be real fun. You can still use plasmids as in the original, but you get access to heavy duty weapons as you are playing as big daddy. I won't spoil much for you but YOU WILL LOVE THE SPEAR GUN :)-NEW WEAPONS, PLASMIDS and TONICS: In this game, you get access to all the cool plasmids from the original, but you also get to use some new mysterious plasmids and tonics. Expecially, if you decide to go for good ending, you will get some really cool plasmids. As for weapons, you will just love the big guns. Trust me on it.-NEW ENEMIES and BOSSES: I don't want to spoil it so I will just say big sisters will make you wet your pants.-FOUR ALTERNATE ENDINGS: Again refer to choices section-EPIC MULTIPLAYER: This game offers a very unique multiplayer. It was a wonderful break from games like Modern Warfare 2. The modes such as capture the little sisters can be fun. Just wait till you play as a Big Daddy. The power you get will truly be intoxicating. Oh did I mention you can use very different plasmids than single player in multiplayer mode.My only complain for this one was instead of focusing on multiplayer, they should have just focused on single player and made it longer. Don't get me wrong , it will still take you a while to go through it (8-12hrs depending on how much you decide to collect).In summary, to me, Bioshock 2 lived up to the standards. It was enjoyable and has a great replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2010"}

The movesare even more fluid, realistic, and the collision detection is verygood.In No Mercy you have many new current WWF Superstars towrestle with including Rakishi, Eddie G, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko,The Dudley's and many others.  In addition to the Superstarsalready present, there are many you need to unlock during the progressthrough your game.  It is rumored that even Andre The Giant is one ofthe hidden characters.  Also added is many more arena's and backstagearea's.  There is a parking lot, backstage, boiler room, bar, andarena's include Backlash, Survivor Series, Smackdown, Raw, KOTR,Wrestlemania, and more.  The outside ring area's are pretty cool.  Ilike the bar, because you can do maneuvers off a pool table!!!Alsothere is a new match that will makes the game VERY challenging: TheLadder Match!  What an awesome idea, however, I think it needs to betweaked just slightly.  It is very hard to win said match, as it takeslonger to climb and tap the 'A' button than your fallen opponent takesto recover, often resulting in your opponent to knock the ladder overwhen you are ever so close.The create-a-wrestler mode has beenexpanded greatly as well.  Many will like the new features, but thesaving component could be a bit easier and more clear.TheChampionship mode is the heart of the game, where instead of going awhole year like you did in Wrestlemania 2000, in No Mercy, you pick abelt to chase after.  The belts are broken down into individualchapters resulting in anywhere from 6-10 bouts.  What is really neatis the cut scenes/angles bewteen the matches and how the story unfoldsdepending on whether you win or lose a match.  If you win matches youearn money in which you can spend at the Smackdown mall for additionalmoves, costumes, weapons, or hidden characters/arena's.Okay, nowafter all that praise, what makes it shy of 5 stars?  Like I statedpreviously, the ladder match can be a little to hard or unrealisticeven in the easy mode.  The manual is a little vague in areas (likestats &amp; shopping).  The saving component could be a bit more clearas well as the ranking tables.  Lastly some experienced gamers mayeven find the easy levels difficult when it comes to handicappedmatches.  You get double-teamed often which makes it very hard torecover and win even if you get an early lead.  Some matches you winon pure luck, not on skill or how badly you pummel the CPU controlledcharacter.But all this aside, this is the best wrestling game Ihave ever played yet on any platform.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2000"}

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever. If  rumors of exciting future accessories for the PS One (a four-inch LCD screen  attachment, to name one) are true, this little machine could become a great  option for the on-the-go gamer.--Porter Hall","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"the game system of all systems","reviewText":"I never would have believed it 10 years ago, but today I think the Playstation One is the best video game system.  For years I made a promise to myself that NOTHING would ever surpass the Super Nintendo.  Well, after years of owning and enjoying a Playstation, I change my mind.When I received a Playstation One as a birthday present in 1996, Sony was *very* quickly becoming popular and ready to take the world of video gaming by STORM.  Back then many people were surprised to see Nintendo take a backseat to Sony.  I was a HUGE Nintendo fan at the time and I simply refused to believe Sony was going to come out of nowhere and push Nintendo around.  Well, they VERY effectively pushed Nintendo around BIG time.  It was a pretty big shocker at the time because everyone thought the war between Nintendo and Sega was going to stick around for a long time.The Nintendo 64 turned out to be a disappointment with its small selection of games and clunky controller design, and that forced video game fans to look elsewhere.  They looked at Sega.  The Sega Saturn was Sega's darling at the time.  Unfortunately the Saturn had its share of problems too.  Just like Nintendo, the Saturn didn't provide a good selection of games because game companies found it difficult to create games for the Saturn.It turned out to be VERY easy to make games for the Playstation.  That led to game companies making TONS of games.  Video game fans were delightfully going crazy.  With such a large selection of games, video game fans basically didn't have a CHOICE but to look into the Playstation.  Now, with a big selection of games comes a lot of crappy ones, right?  Well, yes.  But when it comes down to it, the amount of crappy games on the Playstation is rather small.  Nintendo and Sega fans will tell you differently, though.I admit, in 1996 I thought I MAY have made a mistake owning a Playstation because its release didn't immediately bring many classic games.  In 1996 the Playstation mostly had above-average games to choose from, and didn't really feature that ONE special game to officially show gaming fans that the Playstation was here to stay.  That soon changed.In comes Crash Bandicoot, Sony's attempt at a mascot (much like Mario is the mascot for Nintendo and Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega).  While Sony hyped the game like CRAZY (I remember the thousands of Crash Bandicoot commercials on TV at the time showing some guy wearing a Crash Bandicoot costume and walking around saying stupid things) Crash didn't really EXPLODE in worldwide sales like Sony thought it would.  Crash Bandicoot just did \"okay\" at first.Soon however, Crash gained ground and more people started getting into it, which led to a sequel and a Crash Bandicoot racing game.  I think Sony's attempt to force a mascot on video game fans didn't work as well as Sony had originally hoped.  I say this because today, in 2006, I don't hear anyone talking about Crash Bandicoot anymore.  People still talk about Mario all the time.  Despite that, Crash went on to do very well for the Playstation One.What other games did Sony have in 1996?  Well, I enjoyed WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, Road Rash and Loaded.  But those games didn't really deliver what the Playstation was capable of.  Even though everyone was making a big deal about the things the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn were capable of, the Sony Playstation had a lot of underrated power itself.  It's just that, in 1996, the system didn't start off with a BANG.  I find it interesting that despite not having a whole lot of classic games to choose from in 1996, everyone fell in love with the Playstation anyway.  It just goes to show how important it is to have a good-size selection of games.In 1997 Sony began to realize they were number one and that's when they REALLY started to crank out classic games.  This especially made ME happy because I originally feared I may have wasted my time with the Playstation.  Good thing I kept it!It turns out some Playstation games didn't go down as classics after all (such as Tomb Raider- BOY do I remember Lara Croft's undeserved popularity!)  Other games did REALLY well, such as Final Fantasy 7 which may STILL be the number one game ever made.  Final Fantasy 7 is a perfect example of a video game taking the world by storm.  It was SO groundbreaking in the world of RPGs at the time, and I can remember news stations and even the stock market mentioning the game and letting people know \"THIS game is the way of the future\".  That turned out to be true.  The game was graphically extraordinary and people on the news stations were amazed themselves.If 1997 was a spectacular year for the Playstation, 1998 and 1999 were the years the Playstation was simply the KING of video game systems.  Those three years produced so many awesome games that it simply STUNNED Nintendo and Sega.  The period from 97-99 will always be known as one HECK of a wild ride for Sony fans.  Resident Evil 2, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis 2, Mega Man Legends, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night... those are just SOME of the brilliant games the Playstation was responsible for back then.One thing I want you to know is that I think the Playstation rules so much because the system gives you a nice blend of 2D and 3D games.  The Playstation One is where many of the revolutionary steps in video gaming first happened.I think the Playstation was such a success because it was known as a COOL system.  Teens and adults liked the nice selection of games that featured violence and fighting, and children liked the large selection of RPGs because those games told really good stories.The war between the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Playstation.  I think we know who won.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"CastleD","summary":"Bioshock. A game like no other.","reviewText":"Note: there are basically no important spoilers here. Just minor gameplay and story spoilers which aren't a big deal.Wow. I've never had a videogame experience like this one. Everyone should experience this game at least once, even if you might hate it. And actually, I hated it after the first few hours of playing. Luckily I plowed through the rough patch in the beginning. This isn't a run and gun shooter. You have to think. You have to use strategy. You have to search for stuff, figure out what weapons and plasmids and tonics you're going to use, and figure out how to hack.I wasn't used to this because lately games aren't complex. Games are afraid these days to be hard, we wouldn't want to annoy the player. Before Bioshock I had just beat all the missions in Saints Row 2, and in that game you basically show up, shoot everyone on site, and you're done. It was too easy. It's just a matter of getting it done with basically very little thinking involved, with gameplay or story. Don't get me wrong though SR2 is a lot of fun and I loved it.Bioshock throws some challenges at you. First there's the story which is not easily explained and put on a silver platter. There are no long cutscenes. You're thrown into this eerie underwater world that resembles New York's Times Square. The look of the game is beautiful. You get bits and pieces of information along the way from your audio guide Atlas, and these audio diaries left behind on recorders throughout the world. If you really want to understand what's going on you have to listen closely, and it's worth it. Because if you don't listen you'll miss a lot of stuff and that takes away from what this game is all about. There are interesting themes and ideas to ponder.That brings me to the voice acting. It was top quality. My favorite being Andrew Ryan. He sounds exactly like he should as the leader of this city, and he has some great quotes. He makes it hard to decide whether to hate him or like him while he's throwing Objectivist type philosophy at you--that you may find yourself agreeing with.The tense atmosphere of Bioshock never lets up. You never really get a chance to relax and take a breath. There's these crazy splicer enemies walking around and sometimes you can hear them off in the distance ranting away. They sound sad and desperate. You have to tip-toe around every corner because you never know what's going to jump out at you. There's turrets ready to shoot at you, and the security cameras that you dread, because if they get a long enough look they set off alarms which triggers flying bots that are a huge pain.As you're walking around the levels you can walk right past one of your enemies, the Big Daddys. It's funny how you can walk right past them when they're in non-attack mode, knowing that eventually you're going to have to battle them, ultimately to make a decision about the little girl they're protecting: a Little Sister. And in the first half of the game they are a tough battle. Later on when you get some decent weapons they become much easier, thankfully.The best level for me was Fort Frolic. It's the centerpiece of the game. I would like to talk more about it but I will avoid spoilers. I'll just say that there are moments that are the most surreal I've yet experienced in a video game. There are scenes that a lesser game would have used a cutscene to present. In Bioshock you're free to walk around while this cutscene-like stuff is happening. The whole thing is colorful and brilliant.I found the hacking minigame to be addictive. It's a nice little diversion to take a break from the regular gameplay. But that doesn't mean it isn't stressful. To be honest at first I sucked at it. I used a few tonics to make it a lot easier as the game progressed. Sometimes it's damn near impossible. You can even decide how to deal with these things, whether to spend an autohack tool, buy it out, use tonics, ignore it completely or just try to hack it and risk setting off alarms or get shocked by a short circuit. That's what I liked about Bioshock. Even in this little minigame, they give you choices. It's up to you what strategy you're going to use.There are a lot of different weapons and plasmids to use, but I have a feeling a lot of people rely on the same trusted ones, like electricity. I tried experimenting with all of them. I noticed the guns are underpowered in this game. Which is good, it forces you to strategize instead of just blowing everyone away. Thankfully they got the shotgun right. As we know there's nothing better than blasting somebody ten feet with exploding buckshot.Another nice little thing which adds yet more gameplay is the camera. You can research your enemies by taking pictures of them, and you gain different bonuses depending on picture quality. It's funny when a splicer is storming at you like like a maniac, before you fight them you're frantically trying to hurry and get a good picture.Bioshock can be difficult at times, especially if you try to rush. To ease things there are Vita-chambers spread throughtout. They respawn you close to where you died, and any enemies loss of health remains. So you can keep dying and keep trying and some people complain that makes the game too easy. But who wants to keep dying over and over until you get it right? I like to play right in the first place. Just because the chambers are there doesn't mean you should use them as a crutch. Not to mention you lose all your health kits and start again with very little health. The chambers didn't make the gameplay easier, just less frustrating because you don't have to redo the same thing over and over.One of my problems with the game is switching between all your weapons, ammo and plasmids, especially in the middle of a fight. It can get awkward. Sometimes it isn't smooth and mistakes are made. There are also a few framerate problems here and there. Other than that the game looks beautiful on the PS3, particularly the water, which is gorgeous. I was also happy there were trophies and I racked up quite a few.Towards the end of the game I was getting disappointed because I didn't want it to end. That's why I started it again on hard mode. Games like this only come around once in awhile...actually they never come around. There is no game quite like this.Here's a cool quote by Andrew Ryan:\"What is the difference between a man and a parasite? A man builds, a parasite asks 'Where's my share?' A man creates, a parasite says 'What will the neighbors think?' A man invents, a parasite says 'Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of God...'\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A weaker plot but better combat","reviewText":"As far as shooters go, it's hard to get better than \"Halo 3.\" The graphics are spectacular, the AI is adaptable and the action is constant. Although the plot is a little thinner than it was in the previous installments, \"Halo 3\" is the killer app of games today.The third chapter of the trilogy keeps what worked in \"Halo 2\" and added some new features (\"Ripping the plasma cannon off the turret and going Rambo on the grunts? Sure!\"). There's also a new \"accessory\" slot for things like portable shields and regenerators, which are nice but take some getting used to in terms of using. They are not mandatory by any means however - my first run-through from start to finish on normal difficulty saw me never use one of them.Grenades have changed slightly - there are two more kinds (anti-personnel shrapnel and incendiary), but as an equalizer you can now carry only two of each kind now. You can see how many of each you have at all times now, which is a bonus.I also like how the Skulls are now in Normal and Hard difficulties in addition to Legendary, because although I'm not a Halo freak I like some of the variations the skulls let me play with.A drawback to this game is that it's more linear when it comes to mission design - usually all you can do in rush in headlong and slug it out. I would have liked to see more sniper rifles/rocket launchers lying around - you do get chances to use them, but they are few and far in between - to give those of us who like to \"soften up\" an area first or to do some sneaking around to have some fun. That said, the sheer amount of in-your-face frenetic action is a blast sometimes, especially as you run around in a platoon of grunts with a gravity hammer :)All in all, this is the best of the 360 console to date, wrapping up the original trilogy of what has become THE video game franchise of the decade. It's not perfect, but it's close and a lot of fun: what more do you want from a game?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2009"}

Every single Terminator-based game that was released prior to Salvation was terrible.  When Salvation was released, it received generally poor reviews, so I held off on picking it up.  Then, in that time span waiting for new games to be released, I decided to pick it up for pennies (~$7.00).  My initial impression was \"Wow, this game isn't all that bad.\"  However, as I progressed through the game, one thing was very evident: I was bored.  Why?  Because I found myself battling the same enemies over and over and over and over again.  You will basically battle five enemy types for the majority of the game: the little arial robots, the spider robots, T-600s (the humanoid robots with gatling guns), the motorcycle robots and Hunter-Killers.  After shooting the same robots to pieces so many times, it just became too repetitive and boring.The game plays as a third-person, cover based shooter.  The controls are fine and actually work well.  The graphics are fair, although some textures seem off and the atmosphere is fairly bland overall.  The sound is ok and the voice acting is spotty - some of the characters are done very well (Blair, voiced by Mood Bloodgood, is played nicely).  Others - mainly the supporting cast - are not so great.  Lots of overacting in my opinion.  One thing that stood out and really started to annoy me was the frequent loading and the time it took to load.  The first couple of loading sequences were ok (a T-600 stares you down while you wait).  However, after a couple of hours in, it was just aggravating.Overall, it's an average game that I can really only see hardcore Terminator fans enjoying all the way through.  My boredome kicked in around the 2 hour mark.  It's not the worst game ever - if you can pick it up for peanuts, have no other games to play and are just looking for a filler between new releases, you could do worse than Terminator: Salvation.  Actually, this game would probably be an ok choice if you're looking for something for your kid to play.  Especially if he or she is into shooters.  There is almost no bad language and no blood.  Just a thought.PROS- Decent control scheme- It's the Terminator- Good for the younger kids who like shooter/action games.

I probably won't say anything that hasn't already been said before.  Graphics definitely rival those of Gears of War, and that's saying a lot.  It's not your typical FPS.  There is a lot going on in this game, almost too much to take in all at once.  You just about have to play the thing over and over so that you don't miss out on the beauty.  Considering that I've been brought back to life in that darn Vita Chamber for the 1000th time, I'm starting to get a good handle on some of the little details.  I bought the player's guide and it's helping a little, but I think you may need to play through cold so that you can really feel the tension and adrenaline of being in an \"alien\" environment.  I must say that my blood pressure goes up (meaning I get excited) every time I engage a Big Daddy.  That doesn't happen when I'm playing Gears of War.  If you own a 360, you really must own Bioshock.  Like Gears, it will go down in history as being innovative and instrumental in keeping the FPS genre alive for many years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2007"}

I feel that this game certainly is not.  This is of course my OPINION.  I cannot stand people who who call other people's reviews stupid or idiotic for expressing their opinion.  I am now expressing mine.I picked this game up for $7 plus change at target on clearance a few months ago.  Never before have I felt cheated when spending $7 on a game.  The graphics are good.  That's about it.  It has WAY too many cutscenes.  The combat is horrible.  Basically, I tried to play it twice for an hour or so and it was painful.  I wanted to like it but, just couldn't.I do not understand the great reviews for it.  Then again, I don't know why people like reality TV shows either.....My point:  Just because everyone else feels it's good doesn't mean that everyone will agree.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

Players can look forward to action set in both single player and multiplayer modes--including co-op play--as well as vehicular combat, literally thousands of different types of weapons that change each time you play and randomly generated maps and map features.Playable CharactersBorderlandsfeatures several playable characters, each with its own unique backstory, abilities and skills. Skills can be leveled up, allowing for improvement of things like health, accuracy with weapons and capacity for items. In addition to this, characters possess unique skill tree development, ensuring that each will develop differently regardless of time spend leveling them up.Key Game FeaturesCo-op Design-Borderlandsis built from the ground up to be an exciting, intuitive co-operative experience for up to four players simultaneously that rewards players who work together and invest in co-op skills. Split screen is also supported.FPS Gameplay- In this role-playing shooter, choose one of four distinct characters, each with their own individual skill sets.

And like many pseudo RPGs out now (Fallout 3, Oblivion and so on) there's an abundance of stats for your chosen class but the game handles them all leaving you to concentrate on play. In fact the only distribution points you have as a player is a single skill point gained at every level up that you can assign to elemental skills. I don't mind this, but feel more control over my character's strength and ability would have been nice - maybe have me able to run faster, fly or just more interesting skills than \"10% more chance of a headshot kill\" would have been nice.So off I went into Borderlands world... now at no time did I play co-op, something much touted with this game so perhaps my play through didn't show Borderlands in the best light but I have to say that the 30 or so hours I put into this game resulted in a fairly meh so-so experience. The game's difficulty curve is way off with it starting way too hard and instantly clicking into ridiculously easy once my character reached level 25 or so. In fact after that I simply ran around with a shotgun destroying high level enemies with one or two shots. Even boss battles, of which there are a few, are poorly thought out and just basic blast fests with no need to strategize. Speaking of which, boss battles invariably began with you locked in round room. Come on - seriously? You have a huge open world and yet every major bad guy just happens to stay in a locked round dungeon/cave/shack/pit etc. Lazy.And enemy AI is very basic - they follow a set walk path until you get close enough to trigger them and then they pretty much choose one of two options - hide next to a small wall, or just run in a straight line towards you. There's no stealth, no creeping up and taking them out one by one. One shot fired or one step too close and they all activate. So once I realized this I upgraded my Bloodwing (a self homing eagle that attacks multiple enemies over 30 seconds or so) to max and let him do the work. Well for the most part he would help; sometimes however he would just fly into a wall and get stuck there until he needed to recharge. It simply had poorly coded critical path ability.The quest log was also not without its faults. You are told where quests are located but when completed you have to return to your starting point to close the quest up and get the XP... which inexplicably you are not told so you have to take notes - physically writing down where the quest began so you can return quickly. A simple log of the location of the quest's origin would have fixed this - how could the beta testers not have asked for this. The result, assuming you choose not to write anything down is a lot of trudging from one location to another, and so boy do you get to see a lot of load screens. The title \"Borderlands\" being very apt as each place is bordered by a 30 second load. They should have called it Loadlands. Sigh.Looting, something also boasted by this game, is ruined by the method that you loot with - hold X to pick up items near you. Why? Why can't I just run over them. Sure I can see the need to actually choose to pick up guns or stat changing objects as you might not want that particular weapon or shield but why do I have hit X multiple times for every sodding enemy I kill? A small radius of auto-looting would have fixed this. Once I gained sufficient funds I stopped caring about the items dropped by bad guys and simply stopped looting.The final nail in my enjoyment of this game is the story, or lack thereof. I won't bore you with it but it's very dull and pointless. It was so uninteresting that when these weird alien enemies appeared I had no idea what the hell was going on. And by appeared I mean they literally pop up in front of you as you walk along towards the game's conclusion - horribly annoying and pointless.So I completed it and can't say it did much for me - sure I could try playing it through again with one of the other four characters - but I won't. It's a shame as clearly there's a near gem here but there's something niggling and unpleasant about this game - perhaps it was released too soon. I think it's not quite ready for public consumption and one I can't really recommend.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2009"}

I recomend this game especailly for laid back players who own the kinect. Now on my kinect review, I am not sure you actually do need the kinect to play the game, but it's how I play the game and I think it is probably the most enjoyble way to play. I will also mention that this games visuals are great and the sound matches perfectly with the scenes.Now there are a few issues with the game, nothing to major, but I will mention them. The first thing is probably that the game is in the early stages of the kinect and its not perfect. There usually isn't an issue but their is the occasional acuracy problem, though this probably depends on your room lighting and other things. Once again im noting here this is probably mainly a game for kinect owners. This game can be played with the XBox 360 controller, and not the kinect, but I'm not sure if the review would be the same so keep that in mind. The only other thing is if you are not careful you can trigger the special attack command accidently, by raising both of your hands above your head.

{"product_name":"B00DBRM3G8","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Definitely Worth It","reviewText":"Visual Concepts&#8217; vaunted NBA 2K franchise has a reputation for its high standards, and the series&#8217; latest entry on the PlayStation 4 continues that sequence of slam dunks by towering over its PlayStation 3 counterpart. Not content with a mere visual upgrade, NBA 2K14 on Sony&#8217;s next generation system plays a totally different ball game to its existing sibling &#8211; and while some of these enhancements undeniably have niggles, they&#8217;re still terrific additions to an already excellent game.This is a title that&#8217;s drenched in more authenticity than a players&#8217; vest at the end of a high-octane quarter. Recognisable commentators Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg narrate with considerable clarity, while Doris Burke interviews various athletes at half-time. Meanwhile, sponsor video transitions pop up alongside NBA logos and help to sell the television broadcast feel as if it were real.And this is, of course, where the visual prowess of the PS4 comes in, with each court feeling alive due to the varied crowds and immaculate models. There are moments where the immersion is so great that you&#8217;ll forget that it&#8217;s a game &#8211; even if the uncanny valley will creep in eventually when a player fails to convey the right emotion, or a couple of identical twins pop up in the audience and make the same cheering motion. The issues are more noticeable due to the outstanding achievements elsewhere &#8211; but the game sure does hint at plenty of promise for the future.In fact, given that sports games have historically struggled with the generation jump, it&#8217;s amazing how realistic this title looks and feels. Animations are much more fluid and realistic, and there&#8217;s a sense of physicality to the play that wasn&#8217;t quite there before. In addition, the artificial intelligence is competent and, at times, lifelike &#8211; and that&#8217;s without even mentioning the wealth of new modes and features.For starters, My Career now plays out like a more structured narrative &#8211; a soap opera even. Cutscenes, dialogue trees, and personal objectives form part of your career and the story of your player. Upon picking a likeness, you&#8217;ll start shooting some hoops in the Rookie Showcase, discovering a rival that will follow you through your career and sculpting a personality that affects your team interactions and fan support.Throughout your career, you can chat with your manager, coaches, and fellow players, having general conversations as well as more meaningful, life shaping ones. You&#8217;ll begin by watching matches unfold from the bench, ready to jump in should an injury impede the game or the coach decide to take a chance on you. Then it&#8217;s all up to you to prove that you&#8217;re worth a place in the starting line-up. It&#8217;s a neat addition that provides a sense of progress to the campaign &#8211; even if the voice acting is weak and the coach interactions are restricted to text.There are other issues, too. You&#8217;ll encounter some of the same conversations with your coach multiple times, while you&#8217;ll often be given strange mid-match objectives that don&#8217;t necessarily gel with your team&#8217;s playing style. For as cute as the idea is, it&#8217;s not an especially engaging narrative either &#8211; but it&#8217;s at least a refreshing change from the bland campaigns that are otherwise so common in the sports genre.Other modes include My GM, which allows you to manage an NBA franchise in a socially interactive style. You&#8217;ll be able to converse with the team&#8217;s owner, players, coaches, media outlets, and other executives to solve problems, help grow your franchise, and try to find the right balance between keeping everyone happy and managing your players on the court. As with the campaign, though, the dialogue is atrocious throughout.Online, you can now play The Park street matches with buddies, as well as the standard head-to-head option. Meanwhile, the collectible card game My Team makes a return, which challenges you to create a fantasy squad in a similar style to FIFA&#8217;s popular Ultimate Team. One new addition includes Domination, which allows you to pit your assembled squad against all-star teams and real-world rosters.ConclusionNBA 2K14 on the PS4 is a stunning digital facsimile of basketball. The title&#8217;s visually jaw dropping, technically stunning, and represents a whole different ball game to its PS3 counterpart. The new My Career and My GM campaigns don&#8217;t always score a slam dunk, but they&#8217;re engaging enough to dribble your way through, making this is a top option if you&#8217;re eager to shoot some hoops on Sony&#8217;s next generation console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0045F8QD4","description":"","reviewerName":"TheBeth","summary":"Wonderful Fun","reviewText":"Highly recommended.  I bought this exact set at a higher cost in the store & then when my Mom & Step-Dad wanted it, I did the sensible thing & found this exact same thing cheaper on here.  So this order was for my Mom & Step-Dad.  It's exactly like mine at about $100 cheaper than for what I purchased it - on sale - at Best Buy. Yes I was misguided on my purchase but at least I was sensible for my parents.  It arrived perfectly at their house (I ordered it but had it shipped to them) & they love it.  Anyway...The Wii console plus motion remote, nunchuck & 2 games are wonderful & I'm glad we have it. My parents have it, my step-kids & step-grandkids have it.  My husband didn't want the kids to sit around playing video games all day when they came to visit us.  However, on Christmas day, after grandkids brought over their Wii & played their Wii Just Dance 2, not only was the game console easy for me to figure out (a miracle really) but the games involve a lot of moving around, instead of sitting around. Sure, kids need to play at playgrounds & do other physical things but this Wii game has been a fine addition & we're both glad it's here.  I use it more than anyone with my daily exercise dance games.  Then the kids & grandkids use it when they visit.  My husband only plays it when kids & grandkids are here.  Admittedly, I know very little about all of the games offered out there.  I've only been interested in the dance exercise games.  The Sports Resort & Sports games that came with the Wii are wonderful.  I always remove the disks & put them back in their cases & unplug the Wii at night.  I don't have to do this but I'm a little OCD.  When you turn off the Wii, the green light goes to red light & stays like that.  I keep thinking we're using too much unnecessary power toward the game so I unplug it. My Mom does the same with hers. We're unique. No one else I know does that.  I don't know of anyone having their Wii broken so as far as I know, it's a reliable video game system.  Be very careful with the sensor bar.  It has a thin cord & looks fragile.  Trust me, it is.  That's the only thing that broke & it was my fault.  I accidentally vacuumed up the cord & it was a bummer for me being without my Wii Fit for 5 days.  (I ordered a new sensor bar & all is well once again but learn from my lesson: get that sensor bar cord off the floor).Because we knew kids would be playing at our house sometimes, we bought 3 motion remotes (each different color) & 1 nunchuck since the Wii game only comes with one remote & one nunchuck.  You can have up to 4 playing some of the games & only 2 people playing the other games. Also, be sure to have plenty of fresh \"AA\" batteries in the household.  You'll need them for the remotes & for the Wii Fit Balance Board (if you decide to buy that game).  It's lots of fun & I love the game.  I can't compare it to anything because we've been staying away from video game systems for so long.  As far as I know, everyone is compatible with it in our little family so we're happy with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

Its a great game with a great story. If you want a review of the game itself look up the 1,000's of reviews already out for this game. As far as the graphics are concerned I have to admit I'm a little disappointed. I don't know what I expected. AT first glance you think are you getting the best of the best. The first movies looks amazing. Laura looks different but better, everything is crisp. Then after Laura falls from the ship everything changes. The graphics drop off a cliff and we are left with the 360 version. Its like the only updated the first movie in the game, then changed the model of Laura and called it a day... (The New Laura looks far worse than the original by the way. More like a cartoon for sure) The &#34;New&#34; animations are simply her awkward looking hair. The pony tail moves realistically but they couldn't figure out her bangs as they stay in place even when upside down. (Not a big deal at all) My problem with the new darker hair is that it is distracting during the game. It looks horrible and is always moving around as a distraction in the center of the screen. You really have to play it to understand what I'm trying to get at.All in All this game isn't worth 60 bucks. I completely regret the purchase as I still own the 360 version. With no games available for the xbox one I was dying for anything new and ended up making a bad purchase. Save your money, watch some videos of the game play but really there is no reason to buy this game until its $20 bucks like the 360 version.

If you are a couch potato, I would recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2008"}

If you like FPS games you simply MUST pick up COD4.  The visuals are stunning on PS3 and the gameplay is superb.  This plays and looks every bit as good as the 360 version, in fact I personally think it looks better on PS3.  Multiplayer online is super cool with all kinds of neat perks and level ups that really add enjoyment to the game.  So if you enjoy this type of game then I highly recommend you pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2007"}
