Peavey","summary":"Sonics epic adventures","reviewText":"This review is so long cause the game originally was suppose to be one game but due to time constraits the gam had to be cut in half resulting in 2 sonic games. Sonic 3, when compared to Sonic 1 and 2, is a MAJOR step. With more options for...verses mode and saving ability, Sonic 3 introduced a lot more options for Sonic gaming fun.The game also introduces the character Knuckles the Echidna, whom of which is the guardian of Angel Island, where Dr. Robotnik lands after his defeat from Sonic 2. Dr. Robotnik manages to convince Knuckles that Sonic and Tails are the ones who want to cause trouble, so Knuckles often gets in the way and makes things difficult for Sonic and Tails during the entire game. In verses mode, you can play as Knuckles as well as Sonic or Tails.In the usual game, you can play as Sonic and Tails, Sonic alone, or Tails alone. One thing I really like about Sonic 3 as opposed to Sonic 2 is that Tails can fly, which often gives him a great advantage over playing Sonic. When you do 2 player with Sonic and Tails, Tails can often fly Sonic to high places, but it's not a long time before Tails gets tired.Basically, for Sonic 3, the thing that was improved the most over Sonic 2 was special features (and graphics). Not only did they add a verses round, but they added more options such as time track (try to beat your best time w/ separate characters!). Also, the saving mode allows you to save where you left off from, and also saves all your lives and continues. Once you've completed the game, you can go back and play any level you wish on your saved game. You may delete any saved game that you want at any time, and you can even play no save! Tails can fly, which is an awesome feature. And, another added bonus is the addition of shields to the game. In Sonic 2, the only shield that existed was the protection shield, good for one hit so Sonic could be spared his rings (or a life). However, with Sonic 3, three new shields replace the old protection shield. The flame shield protects Sonic from any flame or fire-induced harm (even lava!), the water shield protects Sonic from drowning, and is VERY useful in Hydrocity (and other levels, since Sonic 3 has a LOT of water), and the lightning shield, which protects Sonic from a lot of electric hazards and also attracts rings by magnet. Sonic can do specialized moves with the shields, but even when lacking a shield, Sonic can do an insta-shield, which is useful when a hazard is near. Tails can also use the shields, but he cannot do specialized moves with them.Overall, Sonic 3 is a great game, but does lack in some departments. If you want a more intense gaming experience, buy Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles together and play Sonic 3 and Knuckles. Sonic 3 and Knuckles is quite possibly the best Sonic game ever, and eliminates all the flaws of Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles.So this time, Sonic must traverse the rest of Angel Island after bringing down the Death Egg (again) onto a volcano and stop Dr. Robotnik once and for all. However, Tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as Knuckles the Echidna for the first time. He taunted and tricked you all throughout Sonic 3, but now you can rip through the stages as him, or get your revenge on him at last with Sonic. Either way, S&K; holds up as its own giant adventure, with the same size of levels, graphics engine, powerups, and other features as the previous game.In Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic must traverse the rest of Angel Island after bringing down the Death Egg (again) onto a volcano and stop Dr. Robotnik once and for all.

{"product_name":"B0000A9Y11","description":"Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

That being said,I think the Gameboy Advance SP is a great handheld videogame console. The things that I love most about it are the clamshell design, the backlighting(so you can see your games now) and the built-in lithium-ion battery(all you have to do is charge it up and you're ready to go). All these things combined make this one sleek system. One that will continue to dominate even when everyone else comes out with their handheld systems. Why? Lots of reasons. Like the fact that it's alot more affordable to get and the games for it don't cost you an arm and a leg(mostly in the $25 to $35 range depending on what games you get for it). Beyond that, there's a huge library of games for it as well as a huge back library of games(from the original GB up to the GBC). That said, I urge all those who's thought about getting one to get one. You'll be glad you did, trust me. It's more than just a handheld SuperNintendo system. Check it out and you'll see what I mean.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2003"}

It had a good aesthetic and style to it, the evolution to system design and combat were great at the time and the cast was amusing and evolved over the game.The 3DS version is pretty much a straight port. With a few musing points:1.) It doesn't look as good as the PS2 version. Outside of shaders the 3DS just isn't as powerful as a PS2 or a Gamecube, but it still looks fairly good.2.) The loading is better. The PS2 version was a complete snail when it came to loading, I'd honestly guess this loads 2-3x as fast.3.) Skits still aren't voiced... and I never expected them to be but it was a bit of a culture shock returning to this after Vesperia and Graces. It's just a shame and worth noting.At the time it was a nice game and localization but time is catching up to it. Still decent, though and a solid port, not too many RPGs on the platform so if you are on the prowl consider it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Unfortunately, BF4 did not meet my expectations at all on this front. Missions are disjointed and feel 'deja vu' from many other shooters out there. There are many bugs and miscellaneous problems that, on their own, are not a huge deal, but together as a whole, significantly reduced my level of enjoyment for this game. A few examples are...- Invisible shield in front of enemies and prevent you from making contact with your shots.- Enemy tanks that spawn out of thin air once you cross a certain part of the map.- Poor texture overall.- Ability for enemies to hit you even when I am behind cover.- Poor selection of weaponry; cannot access sniper rifle after 50% through the campaign?!- Poor autosave/checkpoint location, forcing you to replay large sections of the mission. Extremely frustrating!!!I understand campaign is not a focus for BF4 series but if since the developer decided to create it, they should have put more thought into it. Or else just make it a multiplayer only game such as MAG. If you are looking for solid multiplayer, BF4 is still a good choice, just don't buy this for the campaign alone.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

And everyone stop comparing this to Call of Duty, If you can't look past Call of Duty then just stick with Call of Duty.The game doesn't do anything special, there is nothing that will separate this from other Military shooters currently out. The story is nothing to talk about and none of the characters stick out. But the game is still a blast to play, as I said they don't do anything special but they don't do anything wrong. The single player mode is roughly 4-5 hours long and I suggest starting on HARD for anyone who wants a little challenge.The multiplayer mode is a mix of Call of Duty and Battlefield Bad Company, but more of Battlefield. There are about 8 maps if I am not mistaken, 4 game modes and 3 Classes. One bad thing to consider is that some game modes not playable in all maps. I would say that the multiplayer is enjoyable and should be the selling point of the game, so my advice get this for the multiplayer component if you are going to get this for the singleplayer you would be a disappointed.My .02 cents: If you are looking for a new shooter, Medal of Honor is NOT a bad choice. If you are still enjoying your current shooter, whether is be Modern Warfare 2 or Battlefield Bad Company 2, there is no reason to switch. I myself will probably get Black Ops too in addition to this game but I am not holding my breath on that one either (made by Treyarch yuck!) or future Call of Duty games (original Infinity Ward people are gone!).Edit: Some minor misspells and had to insert NOT..I meant MOH is NOT a bad choice if your looking for a new shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

I got a Wii for X-mas in 2012, and a 3DS in December 2013. I never had the original DS, but the 3DS can play DS and DSi games. I've heard great reviews for this AND the original N64 game. Super Mario 64 is often said to be the best Mario game ever. I played the N64 version first on the Wii. The game was somewhat fun, but the horrible controls and the terrible movement of Mario & camera angles made it 1-star. I heard this game had new stars & characters, so I got it. Plus, because it was a game released in 2004, (ten yrs. old), the camera angles and graphics would be better than the game on the N64 (1996). I was wrong by a long shot.First, the &#34;New characters&#34; thing is stupid. It's a pain in the butt to have to switch from Yoshi to Mario and back to Yoshi for some stars. The &#34;pick up a Wario hat and you're now Wario!&#34; thing is lame because make one error, and you gotta start the whole level over again. I did not like this new feature at all. It's one area that the horrible N64 version is superior to the terrible DS version.Second, the graphics are a nightmare. The graphics look worse than on an N64! They bother my eyes, and you'll keep dying because you can't see where your going or where the goomba chasing you went! Three seconds later, he hits you and you have to grab a coin to restore it. Easy, right? Wait! I can't tell where the coin is! OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but not by too much.Third, the controls are very confusing. The &#34;Touch screen&#34; thing is a fail. You have to drag your finger while looking at both screens at the same time!  If you are playing this on the old DS, your other option is the control pad. I never did good with control pads except on the Wii, so they might not be too bad. I'm glad I had a 3DS with the thumb-stick which is OK, I guess. But why &#34;B&#34; to jump? &#34;A&#34; is a much better fit for this! They used &#34;Y&#34; for sprint(good) and &#34;A&#34; for punch(bad). The controls overall are a complete mess that is not necessary.Third, the sound is horrible. That annoying music! Poor sound quality! That stupid sound Mario makes when he punches! These are all in here.Overall, Super Mario 64 DS is on par with Super Mario 64(N64), which both suck. Super Mario 64 is not how 3-D platforming should be done. For the price of 30 US dollars, this is not worth it. Rent it before buying it. It's not worth one cent to me. If you're looking for a 3D Mario game on the go, buy Super Mario 3D Land, with charming graphics, nice music, and good controls & gameplay. If you want a list of Mario games in order, here it is:Best:1. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii)2. Super Paper Mario (Wii)3. Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)4. Super Mario 3D Land (3DS)5. Paper Mario (N64)Worst:1. Super Mario 64/Super Mario 64 DS (N64, DS)2. Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES)3. Super Mario World  (SNES)4. Super Mario Bros. 3  (NES)5. Super Mario Sunshine (GCN)Overall, for this, buy the far superior Super Mario Galaxy 2. This game may be fun at first, but you'll fell yourself exploding with rage due to bad music, bad graphics, bad controls, and the game being simply TOO HARD TO BE FUN.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

Linebeck.In my opinion, it's a Zelda game that's worthy of the name. I enjoyed it a great deal. Given, it took a little while to get used to the control scheme. Once you play it that way awhile,it starts to feel natural, really. I don't see why that's such a sore point with people who've played the game. If I had any major gripes with the game, it would be the short dungeon levels, the time spent going through them and the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King.  Other than that, Phantom Hourglass is as near perfect a Zelda game that it can be.What I loved most about the game is the fact that it's a direct sequel to Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker. I'd love to see more Zelda games that continue a storyline from the previous game, you know? It's cool to see the return of characters that you know while introducing new ones.

I've been waiting for something like this to come along amongst the kiddy/crappy games that have been pouring out like diarrhea. Zelda uses everything on the DS...I mean EVERYTHING. You never lift your stylus off the screen and you hardly use the face buttons (in fact you don't even have too) Zelda has some of the finest graphics, game play elements, and stories on the DS thus far. You can use your stylus to move Link around, draw the path of your boomerang, use new weapons such as Bombchus and draw its path to get to unexplored areas, draw the path or your grapple hook or link the poles together to make a slingshot, use your bow and arrow to unlock puzzles and other hidden items...these are just some of the great ideas for the weapons and gadgets throughout the game. You can also kill some enemies by making a lot of noise (via clapping in the mic) to make it vulnerable, scream in the mic when NPCs tell you to for hidden items, even close your DS to copy contents from one map to another! You can draw hidden symbols on doors to unlock as well. You can draw on your map to mark certain locations so you don't get lost or even take notes to solve puzzles! There is just so much care and detail in this game it's almost perfect.Every boss fight is cleverly laid out. For example on the second boss fight you fight a giant squid that shoots cyclones at you. He is up in the air at the top and you have to use the cyclones at the bottom screen to aim up top and throw bombs at him. Some boss fights are three stories tall! The story in the game is great and charming. You have to save Princess Zelda (in this game she's Tetra) from the Ghost Ship that caught her when you and your pirate friends were treasure hunting. You wake up in a new world and you have to help restore the Ocean King's powers by defeating the evil Bellum. Now a new element here is ship sailing. You have the Phantom Hourglass which let's you explore the Ocean King's Temple without getting your life drained and you're timed...yeah like Zelda dungeons aren't bad enough without a timer. You can draw your route on your map and sail away. You can customize your ship with parts that you find throughout the world. You can salvage for treasure at the bottom of the sea via a mini-game where you direct a crane to the chest and pull it up. There's just so much in this game it's insane. One nice feature is the online mode. Yes the first online Zelda game. It's a battle mode where you play the Phantoms or Link and you have to put the three tri force pieces in the slots to open the door and the other team are Phantoms that try to stop you. Yes it's interesting but nothing really special.This is a WONDERFUL and beautifully crafted game and is even better than Twilight Princess. The only reason why I don't give this game a 10 is because underneath all the hardware specific quirks...the Zelda formula hasn't changed. You still have spots where it's impossible to solve on your own. Some dungeons are unforgiving. All that is still there. Despite those things it doesn't matter. This game is the best DS game ever made so far and you must own it whether you're a fan or Zelda or not.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

From the uncle that bites ad then bites it to a town that is filled with horrors and people trying to survive, you seem to be the only one with a little sanity left in your sattlebag. Then agian, you are running around and playing catch with the undead, handing out bullets and hoping they don't bite you back for your kindness.anyone who has played Red Read games knows they have a sense of humor in them that can't be beaten. Its one of those Rock Star qualities that is beautiful and that makes this a great Undead selection. Another thing about this is the fact that it is the old west and it is filled with zombies. Sure, much of the world is a fetchquest, but the stuff happening here is fun.The controls are simple and you get a tutorial. you have an easy time with this if you have played anything, too, and even have radar to guide you around. This means that things pop up with icons that show you what is coming, where to go, and what you want to do. Also, you have buttons to cycle through your guns and options, to whistle for your horse, to jump in the air or over things like fences, and to try and to search the undead for things like bullets. Luckily women carry bullets just as much as menfolk do, so you don't die out so easily. Still, it does sometimes get nasty with all those zombies.In the beginning, the zombies seem thin. They are few and far between, and fire lights everything. Then it all explodes and FAST zombies start coming. The normal type are just that, normal, and then there are bosses. Bosses have this way with doing nice things like being horrid, but getting past that is not hard. What is hard is sometimes dealing with the swarms of zombies that simply keep coming. This isn't to say they are not too hard or that an area cannot be cleared out - areas normally have reasons and you can normally clear them out.Its fun and it goes on.The two-player modes are all described in full detail in the editorial of the game, and they are pretty self-descriptive. They are easy to master, too, adn make for fun stuff. Personally I like all of this game for all of that - the fact that I can have fun, make Western Wear look good while kickin' it on a zombie, and keep on keepin on.For the cost of a used title, you can have this so anyone that does not have the set-up can just get this. If you want all the add-ons and all the other stuff to boot, check out that option. Still, this is well a 5 out of 5 and then some.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

It plays more like a $20 DLC, which it probably should have been.But if you're a gamer and a hard-core fan of the show, you'll love it, no question.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

This led to people thinking it was a bad system, and even as far as to say it didn't belong in the class of the XBOX and PS2.  Well, people mis-judged, as this tiny little machine out-does in almost every category the PS2, and in some aspects, the XBOX.1. The system: The GC is easily better than the DC or the PS2 for these 3 simple reasons.  1) It's small, compact, and yet twice as powerful as either of the other 2.  This little cube has enough graphics power to dish out beautiful, splashing water, sharp fighting details, sweat dripping from athletes faces, and fiery eruptions that will make u put your hands over your eyes.  This thing can bring a convincing world to your screen, and is highly reccomended for anyone buying a game system for kids younger than 8, and even those of 8-14.  \"Why?\" is this not reccomended for adults.  It's not that it isn't a good system, or that it doesn't have good games.1) The games are aimed at kids, not adults.  Ok, sure, any Mario game or Donkey Kong adventure can entertain an adult for a few hours.  But it just looses interest, as the computer AI isn't very good, the riddles aren't very challenging, and the skill required to beat them isn't going to make you work very hard.  Most adults also don't like the controller (which I'll get to more detail in a minute), which is quite small and cramped in many areas for adults, and just looks a bit...odd for those hardcore HALO, GTA, or even all those great sports titles.  This system is aimed at kids.2) Capabilties: This system is great for setting up in the car for a long trip accross the country, or even state to state, but it doesn't do much else but play those kid games.  The memory units are extremely small compared to the massive XBOX hard disk and PS2 Memory Card, so you'll often find yourself buying more memory units then games.  That's NO fun!  This system also has no way to play DVD's, play music, and can't be cleaned or fixed when the drive brakes (the CD drive can't contain CD cleaners, and can't be replaced with a regular DVD tray like the PS2 and XBOX).  The size of CD's can also be a problem, as many adults can't even fit their finger through the little circle in the middle, or could loose them quite easily.  It hasn't been the case for me, but I have rather small hands (still only 16).2. Games: This system has a ton of great games...aimed at kids.  If your an adult looking for a little gore, smart, fast computer AI, or even the casual sports title to build a franchise through, the GC is NOT FOR U!  The major games are for the most part the Mario's, Zeldas, Donkey Kong's, Star Foxx, etc...all cartoons.  You won't find the HALO's, GTA's, SOCOM: Navy Seals, or even games like Splinter Cell (nor the controller to use them).  If u want ALL of your games to be Mario-like (nothing wrong with that), this system is ok.  But for the more hard-core gamer like me, an XBOX, or even a PS2, would be a better choice.3) Controller: For games like Pikmin, perfect.  Huge buttons, small joy sticks, springy trigger buttons.  It's perfect!  But for sport's games like those that I love, HALO, Splinter Cell, games like that, the controller is awful.  It just doesn't work.  Notice that SEGA pulled all of their 2k sports titles as no one with a CUBE bought them.  If u look at the top 10 selling GC titles, you won't find a shooter (except maybe Metroid Prime by Nintendo).  This system, or controller, just doesn't work for these games.  On the other hand; for games like Mario, Melee, Zelda, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, etc...it's the best EVER MADE! And if you've got lots of money to spend, and don't mind owning a system just for one type of game, then the GC will do just fine.  But for someone with a low budget and wanting a little bit of Sports, RPG, some Shooters, Stealth, and even Mario-like games (Blinx, Crash Bandicoot), the XBOX was for me (also a DVD play and CD player, GC doesn't support).4) Online Plan: None!  It has a 56K adapter and works on broadband, but nothing like XBOX Live or even the PS2's online network.  No headset, no stat tracking, no buddy list, and not a very big list of games.  No real plan, it just seems to be there.  If u want to be left behind without the online gameplay of the future, I guess the GC will do fine.  But I am a gamer who loves playing other games like me, keeping stat track, trash talking, and enjoying good competition besides my little sister or next door neighbor.  The GC didn't suppport that!  \"Why?\"  I don't know.Overall, the GC is great for kids, and good for the casual gamer.  But for someone who is A) Low on money and would like a DVD player too!, B) Wants a controller and system that works with shooters and Sports, and C) Want's a few M titles in his collection, the GC was NOT for me.  This system will satisfy those looking for a system for kids, a second system, or even a first if they have a great PC.  But I needed more, and the GC didn't have it!Still a great system with great games, and is very reliable, I'd reccomend the system to anyone who can live with the above problems!Thx!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

They are all great in their own way. I will say that this game is a bigger improvement from BC1, than MW2 is from MW1...if that means anything to you.The graphics are a less \"cartoon-ish\", for lack of a better word.The controls are better IMO, but you change them back to BC1 if you'd like.There are more upgrades/attachments available, along with a unique way to mix and match them to your liking.Something I like a lot is the effect gravity has on snipers firing over long distances. It's the first game (that I know of) where the mil dots in the scope are needed to snipe. You will also have to lead your target, just like in BC1.Huge maps, like BC1Destructable buildings, tree, etc., like BC1.Firing rifles in full auto is more realistic. In BC1 there wasn't much climb or wander when firing in full auto.I would recommend it to any one looking for the closest simulation of warfare in a video game. It incorporates squad teamwork, vehicles, armor, airstrikes and much more.

Overall, a great game, and seriously worth looking into! Yeah, I like COD, and all the other military games, but, there's something about this game that makes it better (just my opinion). The game play is very fluid, and you kinda feel like you're immersed in each mission, and the game doesn't feel like your generic \"run & gun\" game.Realistic weapons (and how they behave), realistic vehicles (which you can drive whenever you want to) vast landscapes, weapon choices are endless, very easy controls, killer graphics, and all the other elements of this game, really make this game a worthy purchase. Definitely refreshing to play! There's a ton of Military games out there, but, in my view, this one really stands out. I give the designers of the game a nice \"thumbs-up\" for this one, because I really wasn't crazy about the 1st \"Battlefield\" game....But, they really made a big improvement with this game!Another plus: Replay value! I never seem to get tired of playing the game. It never gets boring.PRO's & CON's???Honestly, I don't really have any major gripes with the game, or overall game play.

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"Proof that Japanese Role Playing Games can and should be on the 360","reviewText":"First I will get what I do not like about the game out of the way. The downloadable content on XBox Live contains a dungeon that is simply a mess of problems. First off, you need to have a walkthrough explaining what to do before you go in. If you go in blindly you will fail. If the extremely tough enemies don't do you in, the boss will. There are no save points and leaving early means you must redo the whole thing from the start. The level design is easily some of the laziest I have ever seen, ditto with the achievements. The boss requires a very particular set of tactics that you won't just stumble into. The rare items you can receive in this dungeon are completely random drops, making it a frustrating exercise to gain them; sometimes spending hours killing the same difficult enemy for just one is necessary. Why the developer went with such a frustrating style regarding this dungeon I do not know. Also, the character development throughout the storyline could've used some work. And it would've been nice if new characters were at the same level as the characters you already have instead of being at a set level. And the \"New Game Plus\" feature, ie the ability to start the game over with your previous stats (thus avoiding the need to level your characters back up ALL OVER AGAIN) actually starts Kaim at level 50. Again, why the developer did this is anybody's guess. If it's not broken.... Kaim could've used a bit more dialogue too. And anyone who is sensitive to the female figure be warned: Two of the three adult women in the game show off some cleavage. Apart from that, however, their bodies are pretty well covered. Finally, there is a plot segment about halfway through that never truly gets resolved.Having said that, the game is fantastic. The characters are interesting and at times funny. The game also has its sad moments too. There is a fairly good emotional arc and the ending wraps up *most* of the story rather well, the aforementioned dangling plot line notwithstanding. Achievement hounds will find lots to do here, as all of the achievements are tied directly into exploration, the many side quests or the main story line. Those who simply want to complete the main game will likely get through it fairly quickly, and those who want to explore more and find that newer, better item will have more than their fill of extra dungeons, quests, backtracking and new enemies to deal with. As it should be, the fiercest, most difficult enemies will never fight the player who stays true to the main story and never deviates. These foes await the explorer.The level design, graphics and sounds are not mind blowing but not terrible either. The main cast could've used some more voice over, as there are many segments where the game resorts to text, but this is a minor issue. The controls are very intuitive and easy to pick up, so while they cannot be customized, there isn't much reason to do so. The system that is in place works just fine.The \"Dream Sequences\" could've been integrated into the story a little better, instead some might say they're backstory, others would say episodes, still others may even say filler. Any way you cut it, you never get to see the lands described in these stories nor do they have an impact on the storyline itself. That is not to say that they're bad. While my other reviews show my general hatred for stories that are written in the present tense, the stories in the game are, mostly, interesting and focus on asking deeper questions and looking on life in general, so I am willing to ignore the fact that most are written in the present tense.Once you're cleared the game there isn't much else to do; no new places to explore nor a new ending to strive for, so that lowers the replay value considerably. However, it's a great run while it lasts.I would highly recommend this game for both the casual and hardcore JRPG fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"Another arrow in the Quiver","reviewText":"The rating someone would give this game is totally based on their dedication to the Halo franchise. I'll admit I am a huge Halo Universe fan, I love the setting. The games are great, I enjoyed the books and I love the story line and plot. Some people may not have noticed much of the plot during the first three games, and you could enjoy them all you wanted without paying much attention to the story at all.That is not the case for Halo ODST, the plot is central in the campaign. You aren't a Spartan, your just a regular trooper, an elite ODST, but just a regular guy under your armor. What this does is leave a lot of room for character development and plot. The gun play reminds me most of that of Combat Evolved, but you can't stand up to the damage a Spartan could, so you have to be careful. Running in and gunning won't work out the same way for you as it does for Master Cheif. So you have to put a bit of thought and tactics into your strategy. And a lot of it the higher your difficlty setting is. Instead of being a hinderence, it took what might have just been another Halo game and made it much more.Granted the gameplay itself has changed little if at all. If you are familar with Halo you will have no problem jumping into this game. The campaing is built around a mystery story and its fun to play through and figure out what has happened to your squad, and what the ONI Spook you jumped in with was up to all along. There are also plenty of places where you feel totally alone, sometimes against a few opponents and sometimes against what would feel like an overwhelming number. So when you come out on top it feels great. There is also a stealth element of sorts, not the hacked on type like normal and nothing that requires you to use it. But being able to sneak up behind a Grunt or Jackal and take them out silently may pay off when the full firefight starts. You feel very alone during large parts of the game and that really adds to the ambience.The multiplayer doesn't disappoint, which is good because the campaign is farily short. Online play is tight, as anyone who has played the series expects. Not being Spartans does add to it, making teamwork that much more vital. The Firefight mode is fun. Coop mode is great as well, but to do the story justice I would recommend a play through alone to really enjoy the loneliness of the setting.You also get a second disc in this game with all the Halo 3 multiplayer maps, including Sandbox. You get three new maps as well, including Midship from Halo 2. Though who have been playing Halo 3 online for the last year probably already have all these making their addition less useful for the full fledged Halo junkie. But for those of us who don't have them yyet its nice to throw them in.All that said this is a full priced game and seems like it should have been a download or addition. There isn't enough new to me to justify the price tag. But I am stuck in the Middle East and was just excited I was able to pick it up on launch day, so I can't complain too much. For the offline Halo fan this is probably best as a rental. For those who will spend hours online playing it, it may be worth the entry price. And for the fanatic, who may not have all the Halo 3 maps, its a must buy. I enjoy it, I just wish it wasn't $60. I do spend a good amount of time playing coop campaign games with family scattered around the world so I will probably get what I paid out of it. All in all I think its a great addition to the Halo story and a new direction, though not a change really, to the franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

I was constantly re-centering the thing, or would be walking in one direction, only to have the camera angle change and my guy would start walking off to the side.  When fighting swarms of enemies, it's impossible to see the people hitting you from behind your character, and that's even after messing with the camera-toggle moving it as far away as possible.  It's just not smooth at all.Second, this game is trying to be some kind of action-rpg, but you constantly collect so many pieces of armor or weapons or gems or whatever, that you find yourself going into your equipment menu ALL THE TIME to see if that thing you just picked up is a better piece of armor then the one you are wearing.Third, the game makes no sense.  After watching the movies and whatever - I have NO idea who I am or what I'm fighting against.  I was at the point that when a nonsensical cutscene came along, I would just pick up my phone and check my email.Fourth, there's ZERO challenge to the game.  Sure, you can level up and get better armor and weapons, but YOU DON'T DIE in the game, so what's the point?  When you die, you have to sit through this annoyingly repetitive cutscene (check phone for email again!) and just start right off near where you died.  So you find yourself just holding down the trigger or holding down the right stick to attack over and over and over again until you die.  Come back to life - repeat - hold down trigger until you die again.  It's not fun.Fifth, the voice acting is laughable.  Many cut scenes don't quite line up and the dialog is atrocious.  Many times while playing, your \"team\" will say the DUMBEST stuff; \"Think that's the last of 'em?\"  Yeah - I've killed 2000 of those enemy-robot-alien whatevers and I'm sure THAT was the last one.  \"Medic!\" - a) there's no medic and b) you never die anyway so what are you crying about?Sixth, your team is LAME.  They do very little, get lost most of the time, and make NO sense in their existence.  Either they die off (they get reborn at random times?) or get lost or just completely disappear.  Oh but don't worry, you'll still hear their annoyingly repetitive dialog CONSTANTLY, even when they AREN'T THERE.--It LOOKS like a decent game - a lot of thought went into the weapons and graphics and stuff, it just plays like utter GARBAGE.  I won it in about a week or so, and plan on throwing it out.  I'm glad I paid like $5 for it used.

Ever want to see Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Blade and the Thing team up and break stuff? Congrats, you've found the right place.Most of characters in the Marvel universe makes an appearance in the game, whether as a playable character or as one of several dozen NPCs, with even more mentioned in the dialogue. Your 4-man team ends up being a personal dream team - in my case, Iron Man, Captain America, Dr. Strange and the Silver Surfer - each of whose abilities you can tweak to your liking. The story is fairly deep and engaging, and took me about 40 hours to beat with most of the sidequests completed. Another run-through of the game took about 35 and saw me finish everything.Two vast improvements (I think) over the Legends series are custom teams and ultra attacks. Now, besides getting a bonus for a given combination of characters, like the Fantastic Four or Femme Fatale (picking any 4 females), you can actually set a custom team and level up their team attributes, like group damage and the ability to have characters \"on the bench.\" As long as 3 of the 4 characters on the screen are from your team, the bonuses you earned for that team apply.Also, the ultra attacks are simpler now. Rather than finding slices that power up an attack for a single character, each character builds up \"momentum\" by beating the snot out of bad guys and can unleash their special attack when they max out their momentum. What's more, all other characters with full momentum will unleash their attacks as well, and with many ultra attacks adding effects to the other ultra attacks, the result is a devastating deluge of pain for all the bad guys on screen.The one downside of the game is the same that plagued the Legends series - most of the game is spent slogging through enemy drones in button-mashing mayhem. Some people find this annoying, and some don't mind - I didn't mind, but that had a lot to do with the variety of characters at my disposal (I made a habit of switching out a character at every save point).Despite this, the game tends to flow very well and is well worth the purchase for any Marvel fan or anyone who like an action-centered RPG.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

There have been some good points brought up against the game (campaign is short, fairly formulaic and so forth) but the simple fact is that the game plays well and is fun as hell. There are some pretty good \"wow\" moments in the game as far as the action goes. Though there isn't a lot new to this game that we haven't seen in some form before, there ARE some cool, rare tidbits. I like controlling helicopters, for example. And though it's pretty much a by-the-numbers military shooter, I equate it to being like a good novel: there is almost nothing new that can be introduced in literature after thousands of years of storytelling on paper...the key to success in in the TELLING of the story. This game does what it does very well, even if there is little new to bring to the genre I still had a blast playing the game. I can see myself enjoying one or two more playthroughs as well. I've barely tapped multiplayer, but what I tried was fun too. Once again, not much new to the table, but somw good maps and a good community of people playing make it a fun experience.

{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Ron Sullivan","summary":"It's Reach Seems to Have Extended its Grasp","reviewText":"I truly believe that if the developers took a few more months to polish it up, [PROTOTYPE] would have been a real jaw-dropper.  There are so many moments that the game almost becomes immensely fun to play, but for me, there always seems to be some  irritation the prevents the game from really dropping into \"5th gear\" so to speak.I won't rehash the plot.  It's a little different and modestly interesting, but the way that it's told, in my opinion, makes it extremely difficult to really immerse yourself in it.  The basic idea is that you wake up with amnesia and need to \"consume\" certain people who are flagged in the city as having a small piece of your memory.  Doing this triggers a flash-back and from there, you put together what happened to you.  In a nut-shell, it plays like a big jigsaw puzzle.  The issue is that you start off knowing so little, that for me, it was difficult to feel like you're understanding what's going on.  This lends the game to degenerating into a \"run here\" \"Hit this check-point\" \"Take out the target\" without really understanding why you're doing it.  This might be something that certain gamers don't mind, but for me, the style of story-telling was a bit of a turn-off.The city itself is a replica of New York City.  Unfortunately though, it's really pretty ugly.  There not a lot of color or variety and it can make it difficult to just \"know\" what part of the city you're in just by looking at your surroundings and not checking the map.  Think for a second, for comparison's sake, at GTA 4.  That game was stone-brilliant at the way it crafted its environment!  This definitely is a missed opportunity here.  Even the citizens don't have a whole lot of variety to them.  You can probably count the number of character models on one hand.The graphics are a pretty interesting mish-mosh of above and below average points.  On one hand, the frame-rate is absolutely absurd.  There are points where there is so much going on that the feeling of complete chaos will be totally and convincingly conveyed.  This is one of the things that [PROTOTYPE] is doing really well and it's impressive!  On the other hand, on top of a fairly ugly city, the amount of \"pop-in\" graphics, I thought, was unacceptable.  For example, there's a mini-game throughout [PROTOTYPE] that has you collecting these \"landmark\" and \"hint\" orbs of light.  One of the best ways to accomplish this is to hijack a helicopter and do a fly-over of the city in order to look for them in open-areas or building-tops.  The orbs won't show though, unless you're virtually right on top of them.  The ability to see objects at a distance is really poor.The controls definitely needed work.  I had the same complaint about 'Star Wars: The Force Unleashed', but the environment being as destructive as it is, is both a blessing and a curse.  There's so much debris to pick up and potentially so many enemies on screen, that in highly-chaotic situations (which is often) it becomes frustrating to try and target the object that you want.  I could be mistaken, but the AI seems to default to selecting artificial targets for me to attack, regardless of distance.  So lets say I'm in the middle of a war-zone and I'm being besieged by both tanks and a bunch of these mutant hunter-things.  If I just hit the \"target-lock\" button, it'll default to selecting the tank, NOT the monsters that are directly in front of me and beating me senseless.  That extra second or two it takes to get the targeting correct makes a huge difference in maintaining your character's health on the higher difficulty levels.  The other thing about the targeting is that it's being controlled on the same joy-stick that controls your camera.  This isn't doing you any favors when you feel you have a good angle on the action ...Where [PROTOTYPE] really becomes a game worth checking out though, is your super-powers and your ability to upgrade them!  There's a ton of really cool stuff that'll keep you playing just for the chance to unleash some of these beauties!  Organic blades, whips, Hulk-like biceps and fists, full body armor, a shield, the ability to glide ... [PROTOTYPE] has got it all!  It's wildly fun to drop yourself in a military base (for example) and just go bananas, you really start to feel invincible!  Conceal your identity by absorbing a military officer and sneak into a military base.  You can then turn around and take an APC, tank, or helicopter for whatever use you please.  Wreaking havoc is what you gain experience from, and that's how you earn the ability to upgrade your powers.  It's all very cool and a lot of fun!It's just frustrating that a lot of, what I felt were, missed opportunities here were totally fixable, if the proper time was just taken to do it.  Whether it was because of time or money, I was left with the impression that [PROTOTYPE]'s designers really wanted to do more then they were ultimately able to.  I'd still have no reservation about giving it a thumbs up though, especially now that it's been released for a while.  I'm not sure it was worth fifty or sixty dollars, but at this point you should be able to grab a copy at a price that's more then fair.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful product that revolutionized the Xbox 360, but there  are some &#34;requirements&#34; to run the Kinect smoothly. Make sure you have a good open area for the Kinect to scan the player(s) (up to 2 I believe). The Kinect also allows access to games that have a special Kinect feature (One example being Splinter Cell Blacklist, which allows you to alert enemies with your voice and much more!)You may also end up using a mount for the Kinect, but I think you will be just fine wherever you put the sensor. The sensor also doubles as a microphone, but I would not recommend that due to the fact that your voice is projected in a loud tone and could deafen the players you are trying to talk to (Unless you enjoy that, then feel free to do so)This sensor is outdated due to Kinect 2.0 for the Xbox One, but if you have an Xbox 360 and want to play some Kinect motion games with your family, feel free to grab this!

It's important to note that this is not the same Snake from the previous 2 games. If you're familiar with the mythology then you no doubt already know who he is. The story this time isn't quite as serious, and actually has a \"James Bond\" kind of opening credit sequence. There are still harrowing moments, as when Snake gets captured. Three characters in particular besides Snake are allowed an unusual amount of depth: young Ocelot, who later becomes one of the series' main villains and here first develops his obsession with revolvers; Eva, a seductress and spy whose loyalties aren't altogether clear; and The Boss, the legendary female soldier and former mentor of Naked Snake. What's new to \"Snake Eater\" are the systems that maintain Snake's health, which include eating food scavenged from within the environment (snakes for example) and curing yourself after taking damage (like removing a bullet with a knife and then applying the appropriate medical treatment). Also new is the ability to change camouflage on the fly to better blend in and help avoid being spotted by enemy patrols. These are great additions. I enjoyed \"Snake Eater\" more than \"Sons of Liberty.\" The boss battles are better and more numerous (the best of which is the sniper The End), and the story never falters.

Obviously there was no real focus group for this review, the only reason I tell you the genders and ages, is to show how this game appealed to everyone who played it in my household, just in case you're on the fence about picking this game up for yourself or someone else.While I was itching to play something new, and normally spending most of my time by the PS3 and Xbox 360 games I decided this time to check out what the Wii had to offer, mainly because I have everything I wanted for the other two systems. I also knew that purchasing a Wii game meant I had to dust off the console and possibly even buy new batteries for the remotes, but when you're looking for a videogame fix you sometimes have to make sacrifices!I don't know if anyone else has ever realized this, but the display case that holds the Wii games in the store always looks so bright and colorful, whereas the PS3 and Xbox 360 cases always seem so drab! I know that's to appeal more to their core demographic but I just found it funny and never really noticed it until yesterday. While looking at this wall of color and scrolling through game titles that seem as if Doctor Seuss came up with the titles, I came across Donkey Kong Country Returns. At first I was a little skeptic but then remembered that for the most part Nintendo's first party titles are normally pretty enjoyable, so I took a chance. When all was said and done I'm glad I did, because for the reasons listed below this game was worth the price of admission.I myself am an old school gamer, grew up with the Atari and NES and just like most people my gaming habits evolved over the years with technology. Most of the games I play nowadays require a ten to fifteen minute tutorial alone on just how to use the controller, before you even get to the actual game play. Games today have these long cinematic cut scenes to help with story telling and to visually blow you away. This game however was not like that at all, once you hit start you're off and running and enjoying yourself. I am by no means hating on the games of today, but sometimes it is nice to get back to basics every now and then.This game is an old school style 2D sidescroller for the most part with a few twists added to keep things interesting and current. The controls are simple and very responsive, everyone was able to pick up the remote and get right into the game without any complications. The graphics are amazing; of course by Wii standards that is, you wouldn't mistake this game for Uncharted 2. Of course the story is out there and crazy, but would you really expect anything else playing a game like this and if you do you may want to reevaluate yourself all together. The closest game I can think to compare this to would probably be Mario World for the SNES.Nothing really mind blowing here just a lot of careless hours of enjoyment and some good old fashioned game play. Sometimes it's really nice to just sit back and enjoy a game and not get all worked up because someone killed you or because you lost a match of team deathmatch because everyone on your team suck besides you of course! So to sum things up, unless your part of a certain systems fanboy association or part of a rare household that doesn't own a Wii do yourself a favor and pick this game up, you'll enjoy it. If you feel as if you're too mature to play a game like this, do yourself a favor and bend over and take the stick out of your bottom, there's nothing wrong with allowing your inner child to come out and play, especially in an ever so serious world filled with so much doom and gloom.Well I'm done running off at the mouth, I know a little too late but I'm done. I'm going back to playing Donkey Kong Country Returns.Happy gaming everyone!Michael","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

I really like this game, and I think it is a game more suited for handhelds than it is for bigger systems. This game is pretty simple and easygoing. You move to a new town and you don't have any money at first. You start off doing odd jobs for the local retailer, who is also the person that built your house. After a short time your are freed from working for the retailer, but you still have a hefty loan left to pay him for building your house. To pay it off, you have to do whatever you can. You can do favors for neighbors and in most cases they reward you with money or objects - the objects they give you, you can sell to make money. You can also fish, catch bugs, and dig - and whatever you find doing these things can always be sold. Of course, if you choose not to sell stuff there are other things you can do as well. You can always keep any thing you've got and use it for your house. You can donate fish, bugs, fossils and paintings to the local museum. Finding new bugs and fish is tricky, however, because the game is in real-time and some insects and fish only come out in certain seasons, but it's fun to see how the museum builds up over time and how many different types of insects and fish you have caught.You can also send letters to the neighbors, and give them gifts, both of which makes them like  you more (and give you better and better gifts!) Another fun part of the game  is trying to find objects to make your house look it's best. Your house gets rated from time to time and you want to make your house as spiffy as possible.Holidays and birthdays are fun in this game because the neighbors actually acknowledge them and do things to celebrate. Like on July 4th there is a fireworks show in the town square.One thing that is new to this game is that you can be friends with other animal crossing players around the world and you can visit their towns, and they can visit yours too.I love this game and I think it's great because there are so many things you can do in the game and so many things you can explore, and some things I probably didn't even mention because there is so much. But I digress, the game goes at a rather slow pace and if you like games with more action this is not the game for you. This is one of the more creative games I have ever seen. You have to have an open mind to play this type of game, because the game is much like real life in the sense that you never really know what will happen next, the game changes as you go along.I highly recommend everyone to give this game a try. It can be very addictive. You may even be surprised at how much you like it once you start playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00542ZQJO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A true \"spiritual successor\" and one of the best RPGs you'll ever play","reviewText":"When I finished playing Demon's Souls back in 2010, I wrote in my review that it was my favorite game of the current console generation, and that still holds true today.  The game was a truly unique and innovative RPG in a generation that, despite being full of many great games, isn't going to be remembered so much for its innovations in game design.  So obviously, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on Dark Souls, the game the developers have touted as the \"spiritual successor\" to Demon's Souls.  After putting nearly 90 hours into the game, I can say that Dark Souls is every bit as good as the masterful Demon's Souls.  Dark Souls has made some key changes to the design of the previous game, yet at the same time maintained, and even refined, all the characteristics that not only made Demon's Souls such a great game, but also, a breath of fresh air.The biggest change Dark Souls brings to the fold is the introduction of a singular, interconnected game world.  Not so much an \"open world\" like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, but more so a series of fully explorable areas that are connected by at least one passage (think Super Metroid).  This gives the game world a much greater sense of not only mystery, but dread as well.  Where as Demon's Souls gave you much more guidance by providing a peaceful hub world leading to the separate areas of the game, Dark Souls drops you into the middle of its world without any sense of where you are supposed to go.  You will receive vague hints from NPCs, but it's up to you to find your way around, and this makes you feel not only more isolated, but also makes achievement even more satisfying.  As you learn your way around, you'll slowly begin to see how the world is interconnected, and you'll marvel at the absolute genius behind the design of the world (which manages even to trump its predecessor in level design).  The same dark, dreadful and isolating vibe that oozed from Demon's Souls levels remains here, and is amplified by the sense of scale you get from this world.  Atmosphere plays such a dominant role in this game; Dark Soul's atmosphere is so thick that it is basically an ever-present character in the world, continuously following you around.A key change also comes in a more forgiving checkpoint system, represented by various bonfires that can be lit and serve as not only as a place to rest and replenish, but to upgrade & repair weapons and armor, manage your inventory, and eventually, warp to different bonfires you've previously visited.  I found this to be a much smarter design than the \"start from the beginning\" method employed by its predecessor.Despite these changes, Dark Souls remains one of the purest, most challenging, and most enjoyable games to be released this console generation.  The combat remains among the finest of any game ever made, demanding patience, practice and cunning from the player.  Your enemies remain fierce, intimidating, and sometimes terrifying.  The different types of weapons, armors and items, as well as they ways they can be upgraded, has exponentially increased over what was offered in Demon's Souls.  The multiplayer component, where hints from other players can be left in your game world, where partners can be summoned to aid in battle, and where you can invade another's game or be invaded yourself, has been given a new dimension of depth with the ability to join Covenants.  And the boss battles are still the most epic and sinister of any other games out there.  From Software, the developers, have successfully kept what worked in the first game, made changes where it counts, and still turned everything on its head with the newly structured world.  The game feels familiar, yet fresh.  Fans of Demon's Souls will be pleased.  For first-timers with the right amount of fortitude, Dark Souls will be a revelation.Demon's Souls is still my favorite game of this console generation.  I'll never forget the first time I stepped into the imposing world of that game, and how I slowly realized that the developers were quietly revolutionizing the RPG genre.  Yet despite this, I can still say that Dark Souls is the better game of the two.  It feels less fragmented, more masterfully crafted, and most importantly, more fully realized.  This is a game that is retaining the essence of the hardcore RPG experience while setting itself apart from its contemporaries by combining brilliant design with stellar gameplay to create an experience that simply isn't being matched by anyone else.  Dark Souls is another masterpiece from From Software, a developer who is daring to be different by reaching further than most others would dare, and is striking gold by doing so.  RPG fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing this game.A NOTE ON THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION:  I ordered this version of the game, and I'm glad I did.  The metal case is very handsome, and comes in a hard plastic slip case to protect it.  A code that can be redeemed for a downloadable strategy guide is included, although I didn't use this, as I don't like to play games using guides.  Best of all is the hard cover art book, which features drawings and paintings of most of the game's enemies and bosses.  The creature design in Dark Souls is really stellar, and having this book is a treasure for big fans of the game.  Overall, I feel this edition was well worth the $59.95 I paid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Gareth Mc Bride","summary":"Bold and Dynamic","reviewText":"\"Bold\" and \"Dynamic\" are often buzzwords thrown around by marketing people in order to hype up a game or movie. In the case of Darksiders II by THQ those two adjectives are grossly inadequate to describe the epic nature of the game. For those who are unfamiliar with the title, players take on the role of Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as you try to redeem your brother War who was framed for the apocalypsenthat was chronicled in Darksiders.At first glance, the game plays as a hack-and-slash game where players must control Death through various landscapes as he wages battle on all manner of enemies. This includes some surprisingly crafty and vicious individuals who take many hits to bring down, including some combo moves which are an absolute joy to deploy. Early on, I became fond of calling up my large (and I do mean large) hammer to lay out the bad guys before moving to my two bladed weapons to finish the job quickly.Of course, there are also the bosses to contend with, and it is a very good thing that Death is as nimble as he is, as Death dying is a rather ironic occurrence. Combat is free-flowing and lively as players can select different weapons from their inventory such as scythes, giant hammers, and so on, and use them to smash, chop, and pulverize enemies into oblivion, with elements that reminded me of a RPG. I was able to gain loot and use this to customizeand upgrade my weapons.Navigation was easy as not only did I have a map, but I also had an avian companion who would help with the pathfinding. Death is a very agile individual, allowing me to climb vast walls, leap across gaps using the side walls for momentum, and cling to and leap from all manner of objects. I did like the ability to do a strategic roll and then unleash into a full-out assault on anything that stood in my way and being able to hang from the ceiling in certain areas was a real plus for me. I also found the control system to be very good as far too often games of this type turn into a button mashing marathon. Darksiders II requires players to use tact, stealth, and strategy as well as a fair bit of patience.I am not one who is big on games with timed or precision jumps. As such, early in the game I was a bit frustrated as I learned the camera angles and movements needed to move about the very large and impressive open-world environments of the game. With a bit of practice, I was able to have it down in no time, and much like combat, it soon became second nature to me as I was able to react without having to think too much about which combinations of controls to hit. A simple move of a control stick, and a press of a button or trigger was often all that was required of me.The environments were very impressive and I especially liked fighting in the ice and snow as it was a refreshing change from the stale dungeon environments that have become all to commonplace in the genre. Death also has a mount which allows him to cover vast distances astride his supernatural horse. I really enjoyed the graphical splendor and art of the game as we rode along the landscape, and would briefly lament the moments when I dismounted to explore a locale, but made sure to make any that I encountered pay for disturbing my ride.All of this would be plenty to justify the purchase of the game, but there is also some great online content such as The Crucible where players will enter a mystical arena to allow players to test their skills against progressively harder enemies. There is some great loot that can be obtained for those who prove worthy. There are 100 levels to the mode and each one is more challenging than the last. Should a player die before reaching an award level, then they lose all of their progress and must start over.Darksiders II also features an in-game e-mail system known as \"The Tomes\" where players can easily message and trade items with one another.

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Mike \"Movie Buff\"","summary":"I'm torn ( I like it, I'm disappointed, It's fun, It's boring)....","reviewText":"When I first heard about STO, I was really excited. When I heard Perpetual went under, I was saddened because of the possibly of STO being canceled. FInally, I was happy to see Cryptic Studios picking it up and finishing it. Cryptic is the maker of City of Heroes/City of Villians. Champions Online was also created by Cryptic. Something different than the fantasy MMO's.Who hasn't heard of Star Trek; from William Shatner to Scott Bakula. I grew up with the first Star Trek movie and while I don't describe myself as a Trekkie, I loved the movies. Concerning MMO's, the first one I played was Sierra Online's The Realm. I've Beta tested quite a few MMO's and Star Trek Online was one of them. At first I was impressed but I wasn't blown away. The graphics are standard Cryptic Studios. If you've played other Cryptic games, you will feel Deja vu. Same thing goes for the missions and tasks. On a side note concerning the missions in STO, one reviewer said that it's constantly either blowing away baddies, patrolling and blowing up baddies, rescuing people and blow up baddies, and beaming to the surface (or space station) and blowing up baddies. In other words, very repetitive. If you just take the battles, they seem to be very repetitive as well. You have \"four shield\" zones and if the enemy knocks one part down enough or sends it to zero, you will take high damage (hull breech). You can either go as fast as you can, to escape so that you can repair your shields, or compensate by rerouting all shield strength from your other shields to your \"exposed area\" of your ship. You also have bridge officers at your disposal. It would of been nice to be able to give them orders, but it's just repetitive clicking depending on which officer you need. Same thing with firing your weapons; click, wait, click, wait, click ect. I sense the battles will get old very quickly. The one good thing is if there is a asteroid near by you can quickly get behind it and you won't take any hits, but if you are being pursued, once you are in range, you will be fired on; there is no gaseous cloud to hide in if you are badly damaged or need to take \"cover\" as in Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. It would be nice to be able to lock on phasers as well as locking on using torpedoes as you hear the captains in the star trek shows/movies. The graphics showing your ship taking damage is nice. It would be nice to see cinematic scenes or even better graphics as you saw the battle scenes in the movies. What's surely needed: making the battles more strategic. What is nice is the fact that you can control your ship movements and speed. You are given a basic ship that is pretty decent with speed and fire power. If you preordered STO, you were able to get a ship bonus. I preordered with another store (initials of GS) and got the original Enterprise that Capt. Kirk captained.; complete with blue phasers. There were a couple of other preorder bonuses that came with it as well. Depending on which side you are facing your enemy, you can lower that side of their shield. In STO, the enemy doesn't seem to keen on moving quickly when part of their shields are lowered. Most of the times, it's like fighting pirates, you can get a long side of them and just fire away...click, click, click, click. It would of been nice to be able to \"click\" red alert/battle stations when you are in immenent danger as in the movies and TV shows. WHat would make this different from the rest? I wish Cryptic would give the option of either piloting our ship ourself with NPC's (as the case now) or be able to have other players be your officers or crew. Another player, if he/she was your tactical officer, they would be responsible for locking on the target, locking phasers, aiming torpedoes ect. If you had a officer that was manning the radar and giving advice to the situation (what Spock did), engine officer, communications officer, engineers, and sick bay. To be a true captain of a starship; this would make it more lifelike and certainly would feel more like Star Trek than a piece of cardboard with Star Trek on it yet you take the cardboard away and you see City of Heroes/Champions Online.I've heard of server crashes, nasty lag, and instability in general. I never encountered it. Lag hasn't been an issue as well for me. What I was surprised to see was a manual that was completely lacking. I've never seen a launch date which had almost everyone every second asking questions that a manual could of answered. The manual's wording is horrible as well. Part of me is wishing that Prima makes a guide! On a good note, the tutorial story arc is pretty good at introducing you to the gameplay and key description. The monthly price is steep; 14.95 a month and you get the first month free. For people who preordered, you were able to buy a 12-month subscription or lifetime subscription. In a nutshell, I have the i7 920 processor and Saphire 4890. My frame rates are pretty good.I was pretty torn on how fun is this game and rating it overall. I gave it 3 stars because I don't play it hours on end every day, but I do play it almost everyday. I enjoy playing it but after a while, but when repetition sets in; Im done for the day. Star Trek Online isn't bad but it's not the groundbreaking game it was meant/expected to be or could of been. You'll either love, like it or dislike it; play it for hours or play it for an hour.All and all, it's not horrible but I think in time, it will get better. It would be nice to see if Cryptic will get daring and try new things. If they see the reviews on more than one site, maybe/hopefully they will. I've seen a lot of reviews and comments and yeah, I would love to see more content and some daring \"moves\" to make STO stand out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"R.

I've always said that simpler/earlier games or tv seasons have a cozy and controlled feeling to them and Halo is no exception.I have played the heck out of this, so much so that the only levels that are hard for me to beat on normal one player are Two Betrayls and sometimes The Library and Keys (but usually outrunning the enemy on half of those levels works). Taking the good old assult rifle and running into a group of Covenent, shooting those Grunts to bitts and shotting then progressivly butting the blue elite to death. Ahhh good times indeed.Also the games story always intriqued me, you always have a sense that the humans are outnumbered even when things are looking up, and the last half has a mysterious and bleak feel to it, enriching the experience. It's just a shame that the game itself doesn't provide much backstory. Not that I'm complaining I love the novels attached to this game's universe.Sure the game does display it's age now, but it remains a fun ride.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

Well here it is, finally in my hands!  I'm happy to report that overall this is a very solid follow-up to the first installment.  There are a couple minor things that I didn't like, but there are a lot of things they added into the game that are just awesome.After the first game I was kind of wondering how they would follow it up since the Halo facility blew up and the Master Chief with Cortana were the only two sentient beings left alive.  Well Halo 2 brings us deeper into the lore of the rings and their Forerunner builders.  Apparently there is definitely more than one ring, or else this game wouldn't have made as much sense without a Halo facility.  I really don't want to give away any of the story line because it's a really intriguing story so far.  To be honest the story is really what held this game together for me, but let's just say that they end up coming upon another Halo ring and there is already a major Covenant armada on site.  The best chance for survival is to get onto Halo and fight from there because we all know the Covenant will not destroy the ring.  The best part of the story is that the covenant between the species that make up the Covenant doesn't seem to be nearly as strong as we all assumed.  In order to take us down that path we get to play as a Covenant elite named the Arbiter.  This is one of the better changes they made to this game!  It was a lot of fun to play on this side of war and see things from their perspective.That's all I'll get into for the story.  Honestly the game play and mission details are fairly rehashed from the first Halo.  This is sort of unfortunate, but somewhat expected because what's Halo without Halo?  But running missions through the Library to find the Index again seemed tedious and uncreative, although they managed to spice them up a little by throwing in the new Brute character named Tartarus (and the brutes in general).  The thing that really saved these repetitive elements was the backdrop story of the Covenant.  Also they threw in new lush atmospheres found on Halo.  Halo is a big place and it stands to reason that not every place is going to look the same, so it was nice to see them try and capitalize on newer elements.  This gives us some familiar maps and ground as well as giving us whole new terrains to explore.  One of my favorite is that at one point we end up on Earth and go through a whole urban warfare sequence.  That was probably one of my favorite parts of the game.Aside from the repeated levels the only other major problem I had with this game was the HUD.  If you read my review for the first game you would remember that I mentioned that the view was great because it gave you sort of a mock peripheral vision.  In this game it feels like you're looking through a very confined screen, which makes it a little more difficult to play in co-op mode.  This is unfortunate because it feels like they removed something that I thought was an improvement to a First Person Shooter game, maybe they felt it was an error?  Of course I think this was more than made up for by being able to dual wield weapons and being able to use the Covenant energy swords.  Though they got rid of the MA5B standard issue assault rifle from the original game and that made me sort of sad.  Oh well, I can now wield two Needlers!Overall I thought this was a very fun game.  I even enjoyed going through the Library again, so while some may find that \"uncreative\", which it is, I still enjoyed it.  The Flood takes a bit of a back seat in this game and show up more as an annoyance until a big revelation at the end.  Story wise this game is much bigger and more ambitious.  I think if you were into Halo for the unique world and story you will also like Halo 2 just as much.  So be prepared for a wild ride to save the universe and see how precarious the Covenant's species allegiance just might be.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Icebergtech","summary":"Great Strategy Game","reviewText":"If your a fan of Halo or games like Age of Empires this game is for you.

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system.

You play as Cole, a man that after a bomb blast discovers he has electrical powers. You can shoot with electricity, throw electrical grenades, jump from tall buildings and send out a shockwave stomp. Almost everything that Spiderman or Batman can do, with none of the main villains. Speaking of main villains, the game doesn't really have one. Sure people go around mentioning 'her' but she's never really seen. She's not like an antagonist or anything.The controls in the game are good. You can wall climb, hang off things, jump, aim and fire. Your powers seem infinite and you get more as you play through the game using experience points that you get from beating bad guys and helping people. There are plenty of enemies. In fact they're usually at rooftops shooting at you, which makes running out in the open really dangerous. So your best bet to stay alive is to climb to the top of buildings like Nathan Drake or Spiderman. I hear that the protagonist Cole is a messenger, but no messenger really wall crawls like he does. Plus they never really say he's a messenger in the game yet I hear developers talking about it. He also wears a backpack yet never uses it. Just seems like a waste.The real downside is the open city exploration feels more like a single player MMO. You walk around to markers that are people who give quests and then you do a quest. At the end of it all, it just feels so random and inconsequential. Why did I just do that mission? To make another section of the city safe so people aren't shooting at me from rooftops? So that makes the game easier as time goes on when it should get more challenging.... So as you get bigger and better powers there are less enemies to use them on.Oh and there's not much in the enemy variety. Pretty much gang members that all have the same exact look... suicide bombing gang members... guys working turrets on the back of trucks and some sort of strange ghosts. The enemy AI is good. They'll run away and be deadly accurate with a machine gun from half a mile away. Not that I'm complaining... if you take enough damage the screen turns grey and you run away and hide for a moment and poof, your health has been restored. I would have really loved to see more variety or even different gangs. Yep 1 single gang has control of an entire city and even though the cops have guns they don't have shootouts with them. No other citizen has a gun either. They just take pictures of you as you walk by and cheer your name when you do good. Some pedestrians will flag you down to tell you things like to restore a near dead person back to life. Yep some street walker drank poison or was shot to death but Super Cole can cure them with electricity like a defibrillator.The main voice actors get on my nerves. The hero / anti hero has a gravely voice that seems out of place and his sidekick has a thick accent that seems completely out of place as well. Some consistency would have been nice.In all this is still a good game, I'm just left feeling like all of the missions were just tacked on to an empty game with good controls.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2013"}

Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

If you are still on the fence about the game I'll give you the short rundown of pros and cons:Cons:1. Voice acting in this game is probably the worse I heard in a game since the PS2. Period! Wish they kept some of the voice actors from the original or used a better tech in how they blended in the voicing. Problem is Anjali sounds more like a computer then long lost god tribe. Would have felt better with silent characters then what they put out.2. This has got to do with the first and that is the story. Cause the acting is so bad that you don't get all of the dialog, which is bad so in turn you don't get the story and trust me being a fan of the series this was poorly done.3. Combat balance is lopsided. What I mean is that when you are fighting some pretty tough guys they move fliudly through their animation, even your ally moves better then you do. Don't know if its cause I'm using Anjali or not but its frustrating when you are fighting these type of battles and your losing it cause you can't hit the button fast enough. Again sloppy work here.4. Camera is probably the worse of them all. it works when you are just running around looking for loot or talking but when it comes to the combat its another enemy. I got stuck once and was trying to move my character into a better spot cause I thought I was stuck, which I was and then while trying to move the camera into a better psoition to see it ZOOMED in on me. Now there are only two postions for the camera that is in close and bird's eye. I play on close cause bird's eye makes you feel like you are playing a held game. Now some of the other titles let you play with the camera and have more options then just two. Again sloppy work here.5. Familirs was something that you had for a while until you either ran out of magic or one of your teammates could turn into. Not something that after a few strikes or even one or two kills its gone. Again letdown and sloppy work.Pros:1. Some complained about certain features that made it too simple like the character control. This didn't turn me off to much but again there could have been something that when playing single player added more depth to playing alone. Not a deal breaker but each character is set up to play solo so I can how this didn't make the cut.2. Menu is great. Anyone that is complaining about this is nuts! Cause as much time as I spent in other menus trying to just figure out the menus this simple menu is great. Short and sweet to keep me in the game and not the menus.3. Graphics has to be the best I seen in the series. Wonder why the camera doesn't let you see all the details? Either way beautiful game graphic wise.4. NO MORE POTIONS!!! Yes!! You are reading this right. There are no potions to create, manage, hotkey, etc. Why? Cause I hate losing a battle cause I ran out of them. Instead they went with a guard/medi system instead which I like and think it works well under pressure.5. Short skill tree though which was somewhat of another let down but again I liked it cause instead of having the same spell twice with different affects, you now have ONE spell with two different affects. Which menas if you want to focus heavily on attack type spells you can or if you want more spell types you can. Bottomline is I'm not in the menu spending points on skills I will never use.And that sums up what I think thus far. Yes its my first play through and only been playing for about 8hrs now and I'm impressed with it and LOVE games like this but only if they are done RIGHT. And is DS3 done right? Does it stand up to other hack and slash games? Can it really be the game that it claims to be? And I have to say yes and no. Confused? Me too. There are somethings that I like about it and then there are somethings that make this game PAINFUL to play. But its the only game of its kind on the 360 that will hold your attention long enough until other games come out. Not one of those ragequitting hack and slashers. By no means do I reget picking up this game up I just wished they did a better job on it and took their time putting this game out. As big a fanbase this series has they should have put more effort in it then they did. And it shows in some places they got lazy, sloppy or just figured the fanbase would react better to it. But I'm seeing more and more PC exclusive games jump into the console arena. I just hope that if they decide to do a DS4 that they make the right changes.Get it if nothing else is out that you want to play but if its not your cup tea then pass but if you are just looking to kill time this could do it.

My issues lie in the progressive difficulty, when you are battling the \"normal enemies\" its great...makes me think of the battles in Mass Effect 3. But then you get to the \"Mega Mech enemies\"(Bosses), they are tough and require strategy and a prayer. My adrenalin pumps and my hands get sweaty...gee wiz, they bosses require a lot of patience. The game is so intriguing that even though some of these bosses are hard to beat, you never want to give up, I don't. Anyway the gameplay is tough, if you like a challenging shooter this is definitely for you. There are about 6 chapters with sub sections, I am currently battling my way through chapter 4 section 3 and I read there were 6 chapters with 2 sub sections. I know I am about 2/3 through this metal mech messy mayhem but I'm determined to finish.

So now we have at least ten different kinds of baddies to fight, as opposed to the five or six in G1. Some of the enemies are lame, like the flail swinging crushers, but the reavers and tickers are cool. Now we have the gorgon pistol, flamethrower, mortar, mini-gun, shield, and prox mines. All great stuff.And now we have vast environments to rip enemies apart in. The locales look wonderful, with more color to them and there are some vehicle driving sequences.My one gripe with this game (and I think it's a game designer conspiracy) is its ease of play. Developers make games easy so people can rush off to buy the next big thing like any good addict. Grubs go down way too fast. I remember these goons taking a serious lead-pounding before dying. I remember having to restart a level several times in G1, but now I just blow through bad guys like nothing. The Lancer is really the only weapon you'll need. Everything else is just razzle dazzle. And that's the rough spot with any sequel like this. Designers overdo it without considering the tactical effect of new weapons. After I realized the Lancer was the only gun I needed, I really didn't care about new stuff.Okay, I have a second gripe. I can not stand cliched characters in games like this. I simply loathe the Texas accented, ten-gallon hat wearing, bad mouthed battle platform driver. And then there's the mystical, oriental Tai, who speaks calmy with few words but is so wise and profound - please deep-six this kind of shhhittttt and serve up some real characters in the future.In all, G2 rocks. Can't wait for G3 - with MORE ENEMIES, BIGGER LOCATIONS, and MORE WEAPONS. See you in 2010. No need to make this game like \"Aliens\" either. We've seen that done umpteenth times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jimmy Kim","summary":"Action, Fun, Replayable, But not Strictly for DS fans *READ*","reviewText":"First let me say that I have been a fan since the beginning. I sat in front of my T.v screen with Deadspace 1 after classes hoping to high heaven that I got home to play during the day time - of course it was always pitch black when I did. Each room, hallway, and corridor scared the Bejesus out of me and I was happy that this game filled the void where Resident Evil used to be. Don't get me wrong, Resident Evil 4 was an excellent game in many regards but was not the scary dark survival game I had been hoping for. DeadSpace 2 did the same thing but with a little more tweaking towards action with a little more emphasis on Cool MasterChief-esque suits which was fine with me. DeadSpace 2 still had the elements to scare and definitely still felt like a DeadSpace game.I understand that games have to change and evolve to avoid feeling stale and repetitive (Call of Duty) but I feel that this game sort of alienates players and fans who loved this series in the first place - it scared the **** out of you.DeadSpace 3 feels as though the team got developers from Lost Planet, Resident Evil 5-6, and Gears of War and slapped them into one hyper-driven game. The game is definitely fun and has a slightly different pace to it but here are some of the factors of the game broken down for ya'll before purchase. PLEASE READ and CONSIDER!Gameplay:It is still the shoot-limbs-and-hope-to-God-they-stop-coming-at-you survival horror game with slightly tweaked(literally) and classic necromorphs. This game tends to focus on the Lost Planet style HUGE bug monsters though which was not as frightening as those damned baby slashers in DS2.(Physics, Limbs)The one thing that I noticed in this game and also in Resident Evil 6 is that the physics of shooting enemies in the limbs feels very funky and not as responsive. Go play DeadSpace 1 & 2 or Resident Evil 4 and you will notice how crisp and responsive the enemies are to those shots. In Deadspace 3, you shoot at the limbs and they stand there laughing at you. It irked me but I dreaded on.(Shop)The game also has a different shop system. This is a double-edged sword to the game and needs to be analyzed more. On your first run of the game, the crafting system is a HUGE detriment which makes you focus on supplies, materials, and item management. I LOVE stacking ammo and upgrading things to make mincemeat of the necromorphs BUT The new system sort of detracts you from the story and atmosphere and sort of offputs you from shopping with the millions of things to keep up with. The previous styles sort of simplified it and made you focus on your surrounding with minimal item management.This, HOWEVER, is also a WONDERFUL system once you beat the game or play on hardcore or different difficulties once you are more familiar and experienced. This system can be played on Hardcore where you can ONLY craft items giving you an extra dose of challenge and I think it is quite brilliant in that sense. Great idea, poorly executed...sort of.Also you get a robot that gives you free crap randomly. Meh.(Graphics)Beautiful in all three DeadSpace games. Brilliant.(Environment)I liked how they changed it up with it ranging from frost planets, dark corridors, and even a city at one point. Occasional Fighting of humans but luckily those moments were sparse. ENEMIES KEEP COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK. Your blood pressure stays high but not because you're scared but rather due to the thought of how you'll have to craft up that much more.(Story, Voice, Direction, etc)A little convoluted but I am personally entranced by the story and find it exhilarating to see game and story progress and come to an end. They sort of left out a lot in the beginning and a lot of inconsistencies (Ellie got her eye back wtf?) but overall I was still very interested. New comers will feel a little lost so I suggest PLAYING DEADSPACE 1 & 2, they are both EXCELLENT games and it'll definitely help you understand what the heck is going on here. Also, Issac somehow has the ability to be disturbed and an Action hero with the occasional one liners and self composure. Voice acting is excellent but people seem fairly calm despite all the ridiculous things going on.(Co-op)THIS is where this game shines and I LOVE that only each player can see things on their screen. It is incredibly fun especially over teamchat, vent, or some method of communicating. I found this to be a very fresh and nice experience to the game. You feel a little less scared with someone crying over a mic with you.SUMMARYI think many newcomers and action lovers will have fun playing this game but if you're looking for a SURIVIVAL horror game, I'd look elsewhere. I understand that the developers wanted to keep the formula fresh and they did a pretty good job of that. I think that DeadSpace fans will love new elements about the game but I personally still miss those dark corridor days after classes. I think I will go play DeadSpace 1 & 2 before I replay this game.4****/5***** Stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"Daniel Wilches","summary":"Loved it !","reviewText":"I have liked this game a lot!It's similar to Darksiders 1 in terms of the history, characters, dungeons and enemies. But, it differs a lot to Darksiders 1 in:* This game is a lot more RPG, there are other characters that give you missions, you collect gear like boots, gauntlets, and weapons, and you choose which to use to boost your abilities (magic, strength, health, wrath, etc).* It's far less linear than DarkSiders 1, with a lot of optional dungeons that you choose to do only if you want to complete a side-quest, there are also optional-bosses that give you rewards for beating them but are not essential to the game history.* The bosses are a lot harder (Apocalyptic mode), very much like Silitha in the first game* You can create your own weapons by getting something called a \"Possessed Weapon\" and feeding it with lower-level weapons, those \"sacrifices\" make the possessed weapon stronger. You can choose to certain degree which qualities of the sacrificed weapons are inherited by the possessed, thus tailoring the weapon to your needs.If you liked the first game I recommend playing this one, and if you like RPG that would be one more reason.In total you'll need some 30-40 hours to finish this game, and 50 to platinum (it's not a difficult platinum but it's time consuming). If you buy the Limited Edition it comes with the \"Crucible Pass\" which is needed for 2 of the trophies, if you don't have it you can buy it from PSN Store.The game features a DLC called \"Argul's Tomb\" that adds 2 more dungeons to the game, the dungeons are not difficult and the DLC can be beaten in 1 hour.

In fact, it upset me, especially when I was in a futuristic world in a city. The thing is though, that first time of playing Jak 2, while I had my doubts, I didn't stop playing and knock it off as a bad sequel like so many others do. I was introduced to missions and I absolutely loved that. I love missions in a game and so by the time I got done with pretty much one of the first missions, which is getting the flag to get into the Underground, I loved it!Jak 2 continues on from the first one, delving into a much deeper plot, involving new characters that are easily attachable (like Torn). I grew in love with the characters and the city of Haven. I just really loved the whole idea of having a sort of..primitive people in a futuristic city with technology that most of the citizens didn't understand. And, me being a lover of constant communication with other characters in the game, I instantly fell in love with it. Citizens walk everywhere in Haven and you do have the choice to punch them (or kill them) and steal their vehicles (kind of reminded me of GTA but it's not GTA so get over it people). The plot is original and though it may be confusing by the end, if you keep playing it over and over, in sequence with the first game, it makes sense. I love games like that, where the plot is so deep that it leaves you confused. Racing was introduced into this, which I think Naughty Dog loved more than its players, but it added to the game. Jak loves racing and that goes along with his personality. I, personally, do not think that there are too many races in the game. You have 3 main races in the Stadium and then a few races in the city. That's all. The rest of the game, more than half of the game, is missions. Dark Jak is also an upside. It makes Jak more unique and allows him to past some obstacles. Jak adds to the comedy. In fact, if it weren't for Daxter and his personality, then the game would be too serious in itself and while the game does have a serious tone to its plot and characters, it also has a comical side. Daxter brings out everyone's true personality, especially with Jak and Torn. Jak proves that in spite of the situations at hand, he can laugh or smile at Daxter, showing that he does have a sense of humor too. Torn just gets pissed if Daxter even talks. It shows that Torn is or acts all tough and is easily annoyed by things like Daxter. Tess adores Daxter and quite frankly..Tess scares me. She can go from bitchy to weird to sweet in seconds. I love all of the characters, even the Baron. They are just so well developed and the voice acting is great! I couldn't have picked anyone better for Jak's voice. See in the beginning I was a bit upset that Jak talked but he grew on me after a while. Even after you beat the game there is still much you can do afterward. Spread throughout the city are devices that you can talk to Torn on. He gives you challenges such as racing and hunting orbs, which have become rare since the first game. Even then, if you're bored, you can visit many places that you've already been to, search for orbs, or mess with people. One time I tried to see how many citizens I could punch into the water (in the slums). I got a bunch of people in there, all of them just swimming.Overall, I love this game! I have beaten it more times than I can count and it is my favorite in the series, being right in the middle. I love Haven City and everything about it. I still become frustrated on missions, having to do them over and over sometimes, but it's good that the challenge is there. Love it, one of my favorite games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

As gaming moves on Resident Evil has spent quite a bit of time trying to find it's footing.  It's not necessarily an identity crisis so much as it is that the gaming landscape has changed so much that Resident Evil has to keep up in an area it used to dominate.  The approach with Resident Evil 6 seems to be trying to mend as much as they can to give you what may be one of the most varied gameplay experiences you'll find in the entire series.  In part because there are times Resident Evil 6 just isn't sure what it really wants to be.  It's not really survival horror at this point, but that's far from some of the questionable choices made with Resident Evil 6.The story is rather simple this time around.  There's a big virus outbreak only this time it's of epidemic proportions.  It's been a long time since the outbreak in Raccoon City and the President believes it's time to let everyone know the truth.  Unfortunately, someone doesn't want this to happen.  And before long the President is infected and Leon has to put him down.  Beyond that the game mostly spans a narrative that tries to weave everything together.  The cutscenes themselves and the narrative actually aren't bad.  As it's easy to be taken in by some of the games cinematic moments.  The writing, however, isn't very strong at all.  There are moments that are quite laughably bad.  This is to be expected from Resident Evil but some of the writing moments are bad even for Resident Evil.  The voice acting isn't too bad, however, and overall the story can be satisfying--even if it feels a little overly long.  There are four different campaigns to play, each consisting of five chapters.  There are the three standard characters: Leon, Chris and Jake.  Each of them has a partner.  Leon works with a woman named Helena, Chris works with a member of the BSAA named Piers and Jake works alongside Sherry Birkins, who hasn't been seen in a Resident Evil game since the second installment over fourteen years ago.  Complete these three campaigns and you'll be able to play as Ada.It's the three campaigns where it seems Resident Evil 6 is unsure of what it is.  As each of the campaigns plays drastically different.  Leon's campaign feels more survival horroresque as the mood and tone of it recall a few things from Resident Evil's past.  The lighting is done in such a way that you can't always see.  You don't always know if you have enough ammo to survive what's around the corner and the audio is sometimes eerie.  Chris, on the other hand, feels incredibly like an action shooter through and through.  Jake's campaign, however, focuses heavily on set piece moments and quick button presses.  It's a strange mesh of things that helps each campaign feel almost like an entirely different game.  Playing through one campaign doesn't prepare you for what you'll face in the next.Resident Evil 6 tries a few new things and tries to revamp others.  The gunplay is perhaps the most noticeable difference right off the bat.  Resident Evil: Revelations had a targeting system similar to that of Resident Evil 4 and 5 but the sixth installment does away with that entirely.  It's a new system that makes aiming slightly easier and less problematic, although there's a lot one can do.  You can finally move and shoot at the same time, although you walk kind of sluggish when you're aiming.  Likewise, you can be knocked to the ground and shoot while you're on the ground.  When you're on the ground you can also roll or shift away from the enemy or slide past them.  There are also moments when you can take cover behind objects, though the game's cover system is incredibly clunky and almost not worth utilizing.A lot of the controls may take time to get adjusted to as it's all been reworked from the previous game.  Some things work out fantastically while others haven't been worked out well at all.  Melee combat, for instance, is better here than it's ever been before.  You can perform melee attacks much more easily now.  Instead of them all being relegated to button prompts when they appear, you can now use melee attacks any time you do not have a weapon raised.  Just a simple tap of a button and you can start performing combos.  You can also go in for stealth attacks or change up some of your power depending on the weapon you've got equipped (for instance, with a rifle you may actually hit the enemy with said rifle).  It's simple and at times can be more helpful than actual fire power as these attacks are incredibly powerful.The same cannot be said about the inventory system at least.  Inventory management is needlessly complicated in Resident Evil 6.  One does not simply pick up an herb and use it, they must assign it to their case to be able to use them.  While it's great to be able to heal at the simple press of a button once it's there, it's hard to be able to manage say your healing items in the thick of combat.  You'll also find weapon and ammo.  It's pretty easy to switch to your weapons as you can cycle through easily, and even getting to first aid sprays is pretty simple (but strangely not the same as using an herb), once you really start filling your inventory out you may find you'll spend quite a bit of time combining herbs and the like.  But once your inventory is full you'll find yourself having to dump things from your inventory a lot.  Once that item is gone it's gone for good.  The problem isn't that Resident Evil 6 has a very limited inventory.  It's actually that it's hard to manage in the thick of combat.  You'll love to get some downtime to be able to requip some herbs or to use a first aid spray or rearrange your weapons and dump things you don't need.  It's just odd that in 2012 inventory management is one of Resident Evil 6's shortcomings.Combat is often satisfying, but CAPCOM hasn't exactly gotten rid of the partner aspect.  You'll always have someone at your side.  This time around you don't have to babysit the AI by any means.  They'll never take ammo away from you or waste your resources and they will never be in danger of dying on you because they're pretty much invincible.  Meaning you can have them soak up damage if you want.  So it's unusual, then, that the AI is still fairly useless.  They'll shoot enemies more here than they did in Resident Evil 5 or Revelations, but a lot of the time they'll still be off doing dumb things.  You can praise or thank them for saving you and they'll start to use more powerful weapons as a result, but the point is that the AI is still mind numbingly bad.  It's just that this time around you don't have to worry about it.  Nevertheless, having a human partner is still better.  And luckily you can play online or locally.  You can set it so people online can join you or keep it private.  You'll also be able to invade other players game as the enemy if they've allowed for you to do so.  The downside to a human partner, though, is that the game can be mind-numbingly simple.  Not that Resident Evil 6 is too hard, but most of your enemies aren't very smart.  When you're on the brink of death they strangely take forever to take that final blow.  A lot of enemies will stand there and simply let you wail on them with physical attacks while the zombies around them strangely sit around and watch.  Even when hordes of zombies are around you'll find the game is pretty relaxed in most moments.  That's not to say you won't die... it's only to say you may die unfairly.In 2005, Resident Evil 4 introduced the concept of Quick Time Events into Resident Evil and since then you get the feeling that the games should probably do away with them by now.  You'll never feel this to be more true than Resident Evil 6.  It makes more use of quick time events than just about any game in recent memory.  The quick time events come around constantly and are sometimes longer than you expect.  Certainly it'll keep you on your toes, but it'll also cause you to die constantly because you simply aren't aware they're coming.  It's not just quick time events that can cause cheap deaths in Resident Evil 6.  Some moments you may needlessly die at because the danger just isn't pronounced.  Meaning, if you don't know what's around the corner you might die first (but at least you won't die a second time).  Early on in Leon's campaign, for example, I was busy fighting zombies underground that I simply had no way to prepare for the train that killed me.  And my AI partner simply didn't warn me fast enough.  It's not that I wasn't warned it's that it came too late for me to get out of the way on account of me fighting zombies so that I wouldn't, ya know... die (But I guess that really didn't matter, did it?).  It was easier the second time because I knew it was coming, but it seemed like I died needlessly just to prepare for it.These moments are pretty constant throughout the campaign.  Bad setups and quick time events run rampant throughout.  When the game gets on a good flow it can actually be rewarding.  There is just a bit of a learning curve to it and a bit of patience required on behalf of the player.  Some of Resident Evil 6's set piece moments are actually really good and shouldn't be missed.The only problem is that going through all the campaigns sometimes feels rather long and unusually paced.  You'll have to play through all of them to get the full story, but there are some excellent moments that are marred by slower paced moments that you wonder why they're included in the first place.  There are definitely moments of padding in Resident Evil 6 that are used to make each campaign last.  And by that I mean, each campaign is about the same length, which means there are moments when each campaign is given moments JUST to make sure they're all roughly the same length.  At least the moments of fun and progress outnumber the moments where the game is clearly padding.Graphically a Resident Evil game has hardly looked better.  The environments are really detailed and sometimes there are little things worth noticing.  When you slide across a table filled with papers, for instance, they go flying everywhere.  The lighting is especially good here as you'll traverse moments that are brightly lit and go down hallways that are dark with very little light to see.  It makes good use of technology.  The audio is also very good.  The screams and groans of the baddies you'll face are pretty good.  The sound effects are amazing and even the voice acting isn't too bad (though they haven't exactly been given the best script to work with).  If there's one thing that will always remain true, it's that CAPCOM will never skimp on the presentation of a Resident Evil game.It's a shame then that Resident Evil still can't manage to be scary, however.  The atmosphere is sometimes there with the lighting and eerie noises.  There are even moments when Resident Evil 6 will honestly try to be what it was at the height of the franchises popularity.  Of course, Resident Evil can't really be scary anymore when the fans are so used to all of the tricks it tries to do.  So it goes a more action oriented route.  Resident Evil 6 manages to take some steps forward with some of it's melee combat mechanics and even some of its gunplay.  But it takes some steps back with it's unusual amount of quick time events, clunky cover system and poor inventory management.  Players may certainly have fun with Resident Evil 6 but it isn't going to come without some frustration that could've easily been avoided with some slightly better game design.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2012"}

I was really disappointed in this game as it was not what the reviewers described.First, the gameplay. It's all about skills in this game. And I have no problem with that. I like a challenge like any other player. I have completed some of the toughest games out there. Notice that I didn't say &#34;beat&#34; the game. How can you beat a game? The game did not play against you. Anyway, the controls, in particular the Wii Zapper controls were not very good. Why is the A button on the top of the gun while the trigger is on the bottom? This results in a sore wrist after a few minutes of play. I tried it just using the old remote and nunchuk method and that, too, was an exercise in futility. Granted, I very much used to the PS3 controllers, I do not understand the button layout of this particular game. But then, it is limited to the controllers that it is made for.The game is basically about moving around the screen and shooting or reflecting beams or missiles. Timing is very important in this game and if you miss just a fraction of a second, you get hit. And while you are being hit you can't shoot back. Further, the evade tactic is pretty clunky. Again, if you miss your timing by a fraction of a second, you get hit and lose a portion of your life meter.The good news is that there are amply save points so you don't have to go all the way to the beginning each time. And you can come back to the game and continue at the level that you were in. Believe me, you will not sit through this game for too long due to the constant movements that you have to make while shooting. Your wrist and arms will get sore from the long session. This is a game to be played in spurts.Second, the graphics were terrible for this generation of consoles. It looked like a Nintendo 64 game complete with all the jagged lines. It looked very sloppy. Even the Zelda games for the GameCube looked much better. The set pieces were very basic in color and design.Third, as some reviewers have stated, it is true that the cut-scenes are rather corny and just there for story purpose. The story, though, is not very good and the cut-scenes are just don't keep your attention. The voice-overs are not great. You're better off just skipping the cut-scenes and continuing with the game.All in all, I probably will not replay this game as others have said they would. The first time around was not a charm for me. As such, I don't expect the second go around to be better. You can play the game over with the other character but I'll pass up on that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Decker","summary":"Definately one of the best games from last year","reviewText":"Having ordered this back in December I've played through it pretty thoroughly to give a review. The game is great, I could say that is much better than the first which was in turn a very good game too. Taking place back on Pandora a planet on the outskirts of civilization. The title name and game environment really does evoke a kind of \"Wild West\" feel. The planet is filled with roving bandits, deadly fauna, hostile terrain, and mega corporations seeking to line their pockets often at the expense of their own employees who are dropped off in this hellish environment. With rumors of another vault in existence treasure hunters begin to travel back to Pandora to find it.Just like in the first game there are four classes to choose from(five if you download the Mechromancer pack). The Commando, the Siren, the Gunzerker, and the Assassin. While they do share a lot of similarities with the four original classes in the first game they are still very unique in their own way. Leveling is pretty the same as it is in the first, which was a pretty well balanced system. Every class comes with three separate leveling branches that offer different advantages. A new addition though is the BA leveling, which while it may seem meager at first it does stack up with some dedicated game play. As for game play, there is a lot of it. While many games have a huge price tag but offer few play hours this one doesn't. There is a lot to do in Pandora. Like any decent RPG you can stray away from the main story by taking on quests from side characters, or look for loot on your own whether you attack monster lairs, bandit camps or weapons caravans.The story is very good, with one of the best twists in any game I've come across. With new great characters including the game antagonist Handsome Jack who may as well be one of the best video game villains of all time. Other familiar faces make a reappearance like Scooter, Mad Moxxi, and Claptrap. The voice acting is great and dialogue very witty and well written.

Well, when I did see it, I thought that it was pretty underwhelmed.  Graphics were decent, but the settings, scenery, and enemies were pretty blah.  It seemed like someone took the worst of the Sci-Fi network and the Phantom Menace and made it a game.Then I saw TimeSplitters 2.  Wow.  The graphics and scenery are spectacular, the characters and enemies are various (I prefer controlling a monkey), and the two player mode is by far the best of any console game.  There's a map editor, there are numerous modes, including cooperative and non-coop deathmatch, cooperative and non-cooperative capture the flag, who can hold the flag the longest, and much more.  The Mexican Hacienda capture the flag mission alone is worth the price of the game.The gameplay is smooth, the weapons vary, and within minutes, a friend and I were hooked on capture the flag.The game is based on some sort of time travel plot.  I had no interest in the FMV, so I skipped all the movies.  At least that provided an excuse to provide gorgeous settings and levels.  Unlike games like Max Payne or Metal Gear Solid 3, the settings are not drab and one dimensional, but vibrant and interesting.  From a western setting, to an ice field, to the streets of 1930s Chicago, to the Aztec rain forest, the backgrounds were rendered seamlessly and flawlessly.The single level mode is fun too.  Sometimes it require some exploration, but it's still very easy on the easy level.  A little too fun.  I completed the two thirds of the game in one sitting.  But, if you want a challenge, want to spend more time on it, and more rooms to explore, you can choose a harder level.  There are about 10 levels, all in different times and settings.In short, some reviewer said it was a Halo killer.  Let me say that it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00CYS5DU8","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Next-gen Madden shows improvement from PS3/360 just not in dramatic fashion","reviewText":"More on this in the coming days with a thorough review, but I thought it important to get up some basics in the meantime.Had this Madden been released in late August many may have been satisfied with it. The problem comes in having played a disappointing 360/PS3 game and then moving up to one here that isn't dramatically different. The run game is more realistic, the pocket and pass rush look great operate much better, receivers actually try to get two feet in on the sidelines, and the smarter defense makes things much more challenging. The new hardware also means simming through weeks in Franchise is instantaneous. Madden has played spectacularly well online - both in terms of online performance and the general gameplay balance.The feature set is identical to the 360/PS3 version. Ultimate Team content can also transfer from 360 to One or PS3 to PS4.Presentation and \"Living Worlds\" remains a huge disappointment and the graphics don't near the wow factor of the other sports titles. Some bizarre issues include CPU controlled players hurdling for no reason and defensive backs who suddenly stop in their tracks for a fraction of a second allowing a receiver to separate. There still isn't a true battle in the air on jump balls and automatic challenges on turnovers and close touchdowns remain notably absent.Madden is probably the most difficult of the three sports games on both generations to evaluate. Is it worth buying if you already had the 360/PS3 version? Is it worth the $10 upgrade on Xbox One? If you haven't played Madden in the last year or more will this one be satisfying? Those are questions that fall on individuals rather than can be covered with distinct yes or nos. Regardless Madden still isn't where it should be and is a *distant* third behind NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14 on next-gen.**************FULL REVIEW*****************Madden NFL 25 was a disappointment on the Xbox 360 and PS3 but the arrival of the Xbox One and PS4 brings promise of a fully featured product with improved gameplay and atmosphere. That would certainly represent a much better entry situation than how the previous generation was welcomed in and for the most part EA Sports has achieved that goal. It just may not be enough to get consumers excited since the base product it builds on was already lagging so far behind in the minds of many.---------HITS-Subtle But Effective Gameplay EnhancementsThe most evident improvement to the game comes with the offensive line blocking and defensive pass rush. Clean pockets are formed, ends handled properly, blitzes picked up, and assignments properly fulfilled. While the d-line still won't get a consistent pass rush from the front four there are occasions where an edge rusher will beat the tackle and those instances look great.The difficulty in the run game has been notched up due to a greater sense of player weight and momentum. It takes a few games to get accustomed to how to run but once comfortable it becomes more rewarding. There isn't a whole lot of opportunity to use the special moves with the \"Precision Modifier\" though as attempting any kind of agile move just seems to be asking for trouble. This is especially seen in kickoff returns where it seems near impossible to get by the first tackler headed your way. That may have just as much do with blocking - they almost always are flying in unimpeded - but regardless not much success is found in the return game.Improved AI is notable especially in the defense as the CPU has become much more challenging on the standard All-Pro difficulty setting. Defenders with their backs to the line of scrimmage won't magically turn around as soon as the QB throws a pass. Poor QBs also throw more inaccurate passes thankfully. To that point there is greater differentiation in the players. Having an Earl Thomas roam the field feels like it matters more now than ever. Players will mercifully try to get their feet in-bounds for catches - but this remains not totally consistent.Bad clock management by the CPU is still present as teams will often run the ball in late half/game situations only to call a timeout right after. There is still no real fight for the ball on deep throws (which are too often thrown short giving the advantage to the DB) or jump balls. There are also hitches in movement with defenders as they occasionally stop dead in their tracks for a split second for no reason allowing for separation. The CPU loves to hurdle for no reason making them vulnerable to big hits and giving up yards that would have been gained otherwise.-Fully Featured ProductEA Sports made a concerted effort to transfer over all the features present on the Xbox 360 and PS3 to the Xbox One and PS4. That includes the full Connected Franchise mode, Ultimate Team, and weekly roster updates. Online play has run exceptionally well and the better balanced gameplay has made them more enjoyable to play as a result. The only exceptions to this being a product where consumers know exactly what they are getting is with the loss of Game Face and the inability to import draft classes from NCAA Football 14.-New Console-Specific AdditionsThe big one here is the in-game saves for offline games. Leave a game in progress and resume it later even after switching to a different title or turning off the consoles. For games in Online Franchise those can't be left and returned to but leaving them in a suspended state is a far more reasonable option with the new hardware. The PS4 offers screenshot and streaming capabilities while the Xbox One has highlight saving, editing, and uploading along with (currently broken) SmartGlass functionality. The stronger hardware means advancing in Franchise week-to-week is practically instantaneous.----------MISSES-Living WorldsFor the most part what has been advertised as a new \"Ignite Engine\" has turned out to simply be a term encompassing the various improvements implemented in the games. Hyped aspects like interactive sidelines are simply not present - and those sidelines look just as bad as ever while coaches don't react to events taking place. What's more awkward than seeing completely emotionless representations of Pete Carroll and Jim Harbaugh? Celebration cut scenes are still poorly stitched together and don't often fit within the context of what has just taken place.The crowd is somewhat improved and reacts better to the events on the field but still has a ways to go. At least now the the stadium isn't half empty because of rain or snow! Commentary does offer additional lines and references to information within a season in Franchise mode but that area is still largely lacking. There aren't even any on-screen graphics or commentary references to standings and playoff positioning. Presentation as a whole has not changed from the 360/PS3 version outside of some crowd shots and a look at the owner in his box when playing as an owner in Franchise.-Deficiencies Carrying Over From Last-GenThe weak presentation - and the lack of ties to events within a Franchise during games - still heavily damages the enjoyment that can be had with the title. The improved crowd doesn't account for differences from stadium to stadium. There are still no surprise onside kicks and even the wind indicator still points in the wrong direction. Essentially the work completed went into the very specific areas of gameplay (blocking, AI, graphics) but otherwise the product is a carbon copy of the last-gen product in terms of presentation and features.---------SummaryHad this been the game released at the end of August it likely would have been met with fairly positive reception. However as a next-gen title it falls short by failing to inspire in the same ways that NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14 have. It may be worth the $10 upgrade from 360 to One and it may be worth the $50 it is now on Amazon for those who didn't play the previous-gen version. Meanwhile those who pass on it for whatever reason can feel comfortable knowing it's not anything exceptional.Once on next-gen though it's hard to go back because it does immediately demonstrate a sense of advancement. Those improvements shouldn't be discounted but the series is still far from reaching the level that consumers recognize it reasonably should be at.*The Xbox One version of the game has more player control, likely due to the controllers (tension in the sticks and range of motion). Otherwise the games are essentially equal. The SmartGlass functionality with Xbox One is broken.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002ELCUUG","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Play, Create, Share - a lot more","reviewText":"BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE GOTY EDITIONPlay, Create, Share - that's the LBP motto and, unlike most marketing empty slogans, Little Big Planet is more than up to the promise.The Game of the Year edition includes all the paid content made available online since the initial release and more - see below:- 18 user-created levels developed especially for the GOTY, good but not always up to the polish level of the professional levels- 3 sticker packs - some paid for these to download, include here- 16 new costumes - see above- the complete Metal Gear Solid set of levels that includes trophy levels and never-seen-before weapons such as the Paintinator- the key to access the online beta of ModNation Racers (after December 3, I believe)All of this on top of what turned out to be an already incredible game that stimulates creativity, cooperation, curiosity and celebrates the players themselves, proud creators of over one million levels, published and accessible by all. I don't play the game so much but, when it comes to the kids, this is by far their number one game and they have quite a few to choose from already. They are proud of their creations and they seem to have what seems to be endless fun playing other people's levels online.REVIEWSince this is about the GOTY, I will not write a full review of the game itself. I understand that many are new to the Little Big Planet universe but, it turns out, great reviews of the original game have been written by others so simply click onLittleBigPlanetto get an idea of what the game is about. Suffice it to say here that LPB takes advantage of just about every feature and peripheral that the PS3 has or supports and its online interaction is simply unparalleled. For example, you can go to a friend's profile and not only play his or her levels but see what other players levels your buddy liked and get to try those out. Or, you can create some awesome weapons. You can include that weapon inside the prize bubble of a level you create and whomever plays your level can earn the object that you created and use it somewhere else - the fun is endless.PERSONAL EXPERIENCEPlay, Create, Share - and, in our case, a lot more. I am not only a (casual) LBP player but also a parent and, to my delight and unlike what 'some' claim, this game has, in fact, made better, smarter kids. And I'm talking about my two boys. They took the 'create' part quite seriously and, after staging duels with custom-made awesome weapons, they began working on their own levels and, to my surprise, they actually asked me to help them learn computer programming - which we are doing now. And their grades have actually improved - the reason they are getting the GOTY is because they've done well in school so far this year.EVALUATION AND RATINGIf the 'regular' edition was a 5-star in my book, then add 50% to the initial evaluation. It's a definite 'must have'.For anyone who doesn't own the original LBP, the GOTY is without a doubt the way to go. For owners of the original edition... I don't know if everybody does this but we were able to sell our 'used' (it was in mint condition, actually) copy of LBP for about half of the original price and we used the earnings to partially finance the purchase of the GOTY.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2009"}

TAKE THIS over and over and over again it just doesn't end. the princess elis idea and not crying kind of threw me off, i rather wanted the princess to be like an animal like a princess hedgehog from ancient times if you get what i'm saying although the cutscenes are really really beautifl. the phrases in the action stages sound stupid from time to time.. like he would speed into a cave and say like oh \"i'm going into the cave\" and in crysis city he would see the fire and say like \" oh that fire is big\" just like the writer who was writing the voice scrypts obviously did a bad job or was lazy, i still remember the sayings in sonic adventure 1, 2, heroes, shadow the hedgehog but i will not compare this game to those games its totally a different game. and with glitches theres too many, but if you find amusement in glitches this game won't bother you like i found my amusement in this glitches like it made me laugh.so basically i base it off like a 2/5 ratio cause i am a sonic fan but this was really poor work, with limited amount of fun in the game.. but there are some things in the game that will make you enjoy it. so if you can rent it or but it for really cheep like 5-10 bucks than go for it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"Man what a letdown.....","reviewText":"When I started the game up, I was extremely underwhelmed by the graphics. The colors are washed out and the characters look fuzzy. IT IS MANDATORY that you turn up the contrast and saturation to be able to see in the game.The basic element of GTA, the driving, has been totally redone.......and ruined. Yes the cars do handle as bad as everyone says they do. No longer is it a joy to drive to the mission areas, weave through traffic and cause havoc. I'm all for realism. I'm a huge fan of Gran Turismo and enjoyed the realistic, slower pace of Killzone 2 as opposed to the unrealistic Call of Duty and Midnight Club games. The cars have a good sense of weight, but turning corners is GOD-awful. You have to go very slow around ANY corner. This ruined the game entirely. It took down a star for me. Surprisingly, it gets even worse once you're on a motorcycle. Not everything about the cars is bad though. The super realistic damage system amazed me. If you do prefer to drive slow like the other cars, then the driving is PERFECT. Once you speed up, it gets real ugly.As for stealing cars, it is MUCH harder this time around. There are cops EVERYWHERE. I only steal parked cars in secluded areas because the wanted system is NOT FUN. I don't want to have to drive 5 miles away from my destination to lose the cops. Matter of fact, I don't really want to drive at all because the mechanics are broken.(I've tried whistling a cab 5 times and ended up stealing the cab and getting busted by the cops on accident.)As for the shooting, there's really nothing wrong with it besides the fact that I don't FEEL like I'm killing someone. With a pistol there is no vibration when pulling the trigger, so it feels very unresponsive. Basically there is no satisfaction from killing someone. The animations are top notch though, so it kinda subsides the empty feeling.As for the city, yes, it is more realistic with the little touches like trash cans and bags that will topple over if you run into them (on foot or in car), and people on the side of the roads fixing their cars. Most websites claim that the city is ultra realistic and full of life and blah blah blah. Well, that's all BS. It feels like a polished San Andreas. One major flaw with the entire city is that if you re driving slow, or cut someone off, drivers will yell at you EVERY TIME WITH OUT FAIL. It gets really annoying and it makes you feel like EVERYONE in Liberty City is an a-hole. There is also random instances where even if you have the color saturation at max, the colors will fade out. It's not a glitch. I believe that is is their failed attempt at fog. IT'S ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO DRIVE!As for the story/characters, I'm torn. I'm maybe 10 percent done, but The ONLY characters I like are Niko (of course) and Little Jacob (although you really need subtitles). All the other characters so far are of the Diaz caliber if you played Vice City. They tell you they don't like someone, then you go kill them. Yawn.As for the music, I try to keep the radio off. I'm a hip hop fan (Sha Stimuli, Talib Kweli, Common, Shad). If you listen to any of them, you'll HATE the hip hop from the game. Lackadaisical job at selecting music that creates an atmosphere for the game.Overall the game feels like a test run. There was a lot of potential that was not realized, and the innovation is not there. The music, the characters, and the story are like an old friend who plays too damn much. You get tired of it, and annoyed after awhile. GTA might be getting Tony Hawk syndrome. Remember the days when Tony Hawk was one of the top console games? Then it turned into a joke after reusing the same formula OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Then it went in the wrong direction by doing stupid thing like adding a lawn mower as a vehicle to do tricks on, and the dreadful \"Ride\"......you know the story. I strongly believe that GTA 5 will be a masterpiece. The idiots who gave this a ten and Uncharted a 9 are insane. INSANE. Rent it. You won't beat it in a few days anyway so just rent it and see if you like it. I am not biased or spoiled because 2 days before this, I was using an Emerson tube TV and a PS2 as my main gaming station. All of a sudden m mom got me a PS3 and a Samsung HDTV with her tax return as my graduation gift. So I was going into this not knowing the sheer power of next-gen game. This game did not meet my basc expectations of going left-field in terms of story. The city is BORING. The 2 main problems are that the driving is awful and the city is a snooze-fest. What do you do most in a GTA game? Drive around a city!UPDATE Oct. 21st 2010I know its extremely late to be updating like this but what the heck. I finished the entire story 4 months ago, and let me tell you this. FOR A FACT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS VICE CITY OR SAN ANDREAS. Anyone who tells you otherwise is CRAZY. There is an unknown nemesis at the beginning of the game, and after the ending that dispute is never resolved. The story is very underwhelming because I actually expected a masterpiece (thanks to the IGN review). Its essentially killing guys that some richer guy who employs you doesn't like. I will keep my score the same. The same problems are here and nothing got better after the first 20 missions. There are maybe 5 or 6 missions that are innovative (balancing on truck to hijack it) while the rest are just killing missions. I didn't want to be one of those people that tells you how much GTA4 sucked, but it really does not meet expectations. Things like only 4 clothing stores and the lack of cool clothing makes it worse. Just rent this. Trust me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}

Square Enix, a company far more competent at innovation than most give it credit for, has brought RPG elements to a rhythm game, and I think the latter genre is the better for it. Yes, it has familiar characters - which often seems to be a source of consternation among those who are tired of Final Fantasy. But the gameplay is solid. The tapping is fun. The songs are memorable.It does get a bit repetitive after a while, but I'm awarding five stars to Square Enix's credit for trying out a new approach.

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Nick Musolino","summary":"War Gaming at its Finest","reviewText":"Medal of Honor: Frontline is more like a retelling of World War II during some of its most classic battles, than a simple first person shooter.  The first level of the game recreates the invasion on the beaches of Normandy, otherwise known as D-Day.  This level is one of the most precise and spectacular video gaming I have ever seen.  Every last detail is drawn out and level is truly something to cherish, and be replayed over and over again.  After the opening level, the game does fall off a bit, but with an opening like that, it's hard not too.  A major reason for this is the difficulty of the game in the middle levels.  It took me nearly a week to beat certain levels, with the payoff not being all worth it.  Still, Medal of Honor: Frontline is a solid gaming experience, redefining war adventure, and creating an atmosphere to be remeniscent of an actual movie.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2003"}

Well plays i can relate to a bit because of how bad Lost Planet 2 is compared to the first, recently released. The deal is, there is a lot of area to explore, much of the same story line as Fallout 3, but it just feels like a waste. This is more of an expansion than a whole new game, of course i knew this but i guess we'll have to wait and see if there is a Fallout 4. My biggest shock was how bad the graphics are, i mean some character models look like old xbox graphics or even gamecube.Fallout 3 still looks far superior to this. That to me is really disappointing, and i thought it would at least be equal if not better than the game before it. The gameplay is very buggy as lots of people have said, that seemed to plaque the first game as well, especially on PS3. I didn't personally play it on there, but on PC i did have several issues with crashing, getting stuck in walls, enemies just vanishing etc etc. On this one i've had a problem aiming down certain creatures, it seems the bullet passes right through them and they just keep coming. Also i kept dying by just standing still and just had to restart the game because i could do nothing. Well much like Fallout 3 i guess we'll have to wait for the usual patches. Its not my computer for sure, i have a good gaming rig with 8 gigs of RAM, 2.67 Core 2 quad, and a 4850 1 gigDDR3 card. I've played everything maxed out, but this game maxed out not only looks pathetic, but is just so glitchy when you play it sometimes that you just want to quit. It randomly freezes and the frame rates drop pretty drastically no matter what setting you have the display on. Oh well, no use in complaining, just another disappointing game this year. I really enjoy playing the game Singularity, and it was a very overlooked, underrated game. Sure it got recognized but not nearly enough. If you love Bioshock, Fallout 3, or the FEAR series play it instead, great game with no glitches. But if you can get past the problems of this game, and the poor graphics then be my guest.And for you morons who comment on grammar, i know how to write, but i type fast and i don't care about it on here.

Unfortunately the game was largely a disappointment and a major step down from Guitar Hero. I played it a few times to see if my opinion would change. Unfortunately it did not.When I opened the box I was extremely impressed with the controller. It looks great and is a lot of fun to play around with. This set my expectations pretty high since I don't really find the guitar hero controller very fun to play around with without the game. The controller gives you a good feel of what a basic DJ turntable is like and the Xbox controls are discretely hidden. So from a hardware perspective DJ Hero is impressive.The problem with the game is the gameplay itself. The game is hard to figure out even with the tutorial and was surprisingly boring once I managed to figure it out. The turntable only has three buttons and is pretty boring even with the scratch feature, something I thought would be pretty cool.The game is pretty pricey and is not really worth the money. The controller is pretty nice though and it shows that the game has potential. Unfortunately for us we'll have to wait for DJ Hero 2 to see the full potential of the controller. The music is nice but not really all that different from the music found in Dance Dance Revolution. If you want a fun party game that's not Guitar Hero than DDR is a much better bet than DJ Hero.

{"product_name":"B00420K18K","description":"","reviewerName":"OJ Silk","summary":"Again, #1 Baseball Game + slight improvements","reviewText":"Without a doubt, Sony's MLB The Show series is heads above the 2k series. Plain & simple, it's the best baseball game year in & year out (like NBA 2K vs. NBA Live, no contest). Therefore, The Show competes against itself and to their credit (unlike Madden), they continue to push the envelope and make changes that enhance gameplay & strategy. This year, The Show has made two significant changes in the two most important aspects -- pitching and hitting. In addition, ball physics are more real than ever before.PRESENTATION (9/10): Excellent as usual. Easy to navigate menus with a nice baseball feel. Commentary is excellent & delivered by the 3-man team of Matt Vasgersian, Dave Campbell & Erik Karros. Despite some of the commentary being similar to '11, listening to them is like listening to a real game & unlike most sports games, it hardly gets repetitive and enhances the experience. There are tons of camera angles cutting between players, benches & the crowd. The stadiums' ambiance rounds out the complete baseball experience. Option to install game data on PS3 HDD is supposed to cut down on load times but not by much IMO.GAMEPLAY (8.5/10): Players can use the newly featured swinging & pitching controls or if comfortable with the analog style, they can use that one. New are \"Zone Analog Batting\" where players have more control of their swings. This gives you more control as to where you are swinging. Pitching is now done via \"Pulse Pitching\", not the pitching meter. The mechanic works like this -- after selecting your pitch, a pulsing circle pops up (changing from bigger to smaller). The smaller the circle, the better control. Both hitting & pitching take a little getting used but rewarding in the end. As before mentioned, those who don't like it, can play with without these new controls. \"PS Move\" support works for the whole game now, not just HR Derby. It works well for hitting & pitching, not so much for fielding & running. Besides tennis games, I'm not a fan of Move controls but if it's your cup of tea, it's definitely been incorporated heavily in this game.GRAPHICS (10/10): Player models look incredible as player likeness' are better than in any sports game. Animations & ball physics really add to the game. If you don't follow the spin of the ball, you may make a fielding error. That's how good & realistic it is. The array of camera angles & overall presentation really make it like an actual broadcast and as usual, you can skip these for a faster game. Last but not least, the Stadiums look terrific.CAREER MODE (9/10) & ONLINE (6/10): Road to the Show career mode has always been one of the best in any sports game and it returns, of course. As usual, it features lots of customizations. A new mode similar to EA's Ultimate Team has been added, called Diamond Dynasty. This mode lets you take a customized team & have it compete vs. Humans/CPU. It's perhaps too early to tell but online issues persist as servers were down initially & lag issues from the past persist. Much depends on how busy servers are, so it may improve. Therefore, time will tell (but offline is where the game shines bright).OVERALL (9/10). Once again -- the best video game of baseball, hands down. Slightly improved over '11. I like the changes and additions made & I'm very pleased that San Diego Studios didn't just rest on it's laurels. If at all possible, the game is more polished than ever before & for Move fans, it now has full support. While some may find the game difficult, there are always game sliders & Amateur mode so in reality, not much to complain about here. Baseball season has arrived -- PLAY BALL!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

Paul \"John doe\"","summary":"The best of any Zelda game","reviewText":"Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past released in 1992 big hit for The SNES & around this time 92-94 was when the Super Nintendo & Sega Genesis were neck & neck & while the Sega Genesis had great beat em ups arcade games shooters & fighting games. If you wanted RPG's adventure games puzzles solving platformers you went for The Super Nintendo. Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past is in my opinion is the best of any Zelda game I know some will say \"Oh what about Ocorina Of Time\" Ocorina Of Time is awesome I love that game I played it a lot when it came out & I still do play these games here & there. There all awesome I do think of some  Zelda games as there own game others are sequels like  Adventure Of Link was a sequel to the 1st Zelda or Majorias Mask is a sequel to Ocorina Of Time. LTP is it's  own game like Ocorina Of Time is it's own game. Most games for me don't need a storyline. Zelda on the other hand needs a story. The story is Zelda contacts Link telepathically Link's Uncle heads out to you follow him & find him wounded it's all up to you. You find Zelda & you take her to some Preist then you go out to find 3 Pendants to get The Master Sword. There's the Eastern Palace, The Desert Palace & then then the palace in the mountains. You need The Master Sword to kill Agahnim who works for the main villain Gannon Agahnim us taking these Maidens into the Dark World so Gannon can unlock the Triforce also in the graphic novel Agahnim does more than Gannon's bidding he actually r @ p 3 s them. The 1st 2 Dungones you should get through with no problem the mountain dungon is a little more tricky & the boss when he knocks you over to the side & you have to go back & fight him again God is that frustrating. When you do get The Master Sword Zelda contacts you telepathically she's been kidnapped by Agahnim so you try to save her but it's to late he trransports her to The Dark World where you have save The 6 Maidens the 1st 2 dungens souldn't be a problem but when you get to the 3rd & 4th where you got to use your head. Playing it again some of it was by memory some was help from a walktrough & some was help via playthrough videos. The palace in The Dark Woods those hand things that grab you & take you back to the beginning I hate those things. I forgot that you had to open a hole in the 4th dungon so the light would be in the room. I feel it is a smart game a well done game. Cause you have to to look for weapons magical weapons that get you from point A to point B the 5th dungon The Ice Palace is no different you will have a lot of puzzle solving & it can be frustrating but it never gets boring. When you do get to Turtle Rock this dungon will get on your nerves but if you keep on trying you will beat it. You better keep magic potions handy too. When you do get past Turtle Rock you save Zelda & she tells the task is at hand. She should've said beat the s hi  t out of him! Gannon's palace isn't as hard as Turtle Rock but it is still tricky. You fight all 3 bosses from The Light World again then Agahnim he has these 2 clones of him but it's easy to spot the real 1. After you defeat him you fight Gannon & of course what else he wants to take over the world. When Gannon does his little diappering act & when he knocks you over to the side oh that makes me mad. So be careful don't get knocked over the side. When you defeat him you get a big ending satisfying ending. If you don't have this in your SNES collection you should get it. If you have a Wii you can download it I think I don't know I don't own a Wii. There was a collection of The Zelda games on The Gamecube & if you have a SNES emulator get it. I doubt most of these kids could have the patience to playthrough Zelda on The NES or Zelda LTP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

I also have an xbox 360 as well, but I am still using my xbox more than my new wii u. You could say that there aren't too many games out, or you can say this console sucks. Personally, I think this console is good, but it could have been so much better.My only real problem with this console is the gamepad. The gamepad is a cool idea for certain games (nintendo land's luigi's mansion mini game, lots of fun) but it kind of makes the tv pointless sometimes. When you turn on the wii u, you have to browse the dashboard with the gamepad, which really annoys me. I hate having to look down at this small screen when I could just look at my 52 inch hd tv.Also, I wish they had better options for controllers, yes I know the wii u pro controller is an option, but the thumb sticks on that controller is very awkward. I tried to use it for shooter games, but I just don't feel comfortable. I am a nintendo fan, always will be. But I just hate how nintendo thinks sometimes. Why release a clunky game pad controller? Can't you just make a comfortable controller like how you made the amazing gamecube controller? Those little things make me sad, but the games somewhat cancel that out for me.The first party games will be really really good. Super smash bros, and legend of zelda are the games I really love, and I know Nintendo will release quality games, reason being, they are not like Ubisoft or Activision, these two companies release games every year for profit and not for creating games that are amazing and memorable. Yes Zelda games have to bring a profit as well, but at least Zelda games are amazing in story and gameplay.Unfortunately, the third party games are weak. I know for a fact that Bethesda will not release any games for the Wii U due to the weak hardware. Xbox one and Ps4 are just plain out better consoles for 3rd party games, and you can thank Nintendo for that.If only I was there when Nintendo created the Wii U. I would have told them to make it a powerful console with at least 100gb of memory and include a controller similar to the gamecube instead of the gamepad. Sell the console for 400 instead of the 350 they started off with.  And bam they would wipe out the playstation and xbox. Nintendo would have the third party support, and the best 1st party games, but no, they went down the \"innovative path\". Ah, whatever. I recommend this console though nonetheless. It's definitely no xbox or ps4, but it is a worth console. Buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2013"}

In it, players will be able to travel in the wake of the Fellowship with a unique structure that allows them to explore their own path while periodically intersecting with the major events of the films.

Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"RPG fun in Middle Earth, similar to Final Fantasy","reviewText":"\"Lord of the Rings: The Third Age\" is the first Role Playing Game (RPG) set in Middle Earth for the Playstation 2.  Previous LOTR games have been adventure games with a focus on hacking the bad guys with your sword.  \"LOTR: The Third Age\" is a turn based RPG where your characters take turns attacking and being attacked.  This game follows the storyline of the novel, but in a slightly different way.  Rather than controlling the primary characters of the novel (Frodo, Aragorn, Legolas, etc), we start the game in control of a Gondorian named Berethor.  I don't remember a Berethor from the books, but perhaps he was mentioned in an appendix.  Perhaps not.  Either way the quest begins with Berethor having been given a mission from Gandalf to aid in the battle for Middle Earth.  As Berethor continues he meets up with other warriors: the elf Idrial, Hadhod the dwarf, a ranger named Elegost, and two others.  Together this group follows just a few steps away from the Fellowship, so it is as if we are shadowing the storyline of the novels.  From time to time we even find ourselves caught up in events from the novels.  We help Gandalf fight the Balrog, Eowyn fight the Nazgul, and assist in the defense of Helm's Deep.  While being a part of these events doesn't quite jive with the books or movies, at least it gives a sense of purpose and importance to the story while not just telling the same story of the novels over and over again.The combat system is clearly based on that of \"Final Fantasy X\".  It is turn based and includes a listing of which character (or enemy) will attack in which order.  When the party grows to more than three characters we are able to switch the character who's turn it is in or out of the battle to give another character a shot at the fight.  This also works just like \"Final Fantasy X\".  Combat is fairly quick and not exceptionally difficult.  Characters gain enough experience points after each battle (if used in every battle) that they gain an experience level every couple of fights early in the game and still rather frequently much later in the game.  When a character gains a level his (or her) health points and action points (points used to perform magic or special attack skills) are completely refilled.  Using these skills frequently is a must because it is only through use that a character will learn new skills that will prove vital throughout the game (oh, how I wish I learned Elegost's Arrows of Sleep earlier).This is a very linear game without much opportunity to truly wander off and explore Middle Earth.  In certain places of the World Map for a chapter you can explore that area as long as there is a path, but otherwise the rest of the world is off limits.  On the other hand, this game gives the opportunity to explore Helm's Deep, and play in the mines of Moria and defend Osgiliath.  We get to fight Grima Wormtongue and slap him around a bit.  As I haven't played (and don't plan on playing) the other LOTR games actually starring the main cast, this game is my lone opportunity to experience Middle Earth.There are 109 sequences from the movie trilogy narrated by Ian McKellan (Gandalf) giving some history of LOTR as well as giving instruction to Berethor and talking about the characters in this game.  It is well done and while the sequences are out of chronology, it is nice to see.There is also a setting called \"Evil Mode\".  After beating a chapter in the game a chapter of \"Evil Mode\" is unlocked.  In this mode you can fight as the enemies against the heroes.  Unfortunately we don't get to play through the game or explore as the bad guys, but each chapter of \"Evil Mode\" is a series of three or four fights.  The first fight may be a bunch of goblins against the heroes, then a troll battle, and then a boss battle.  Throughout the various chapters in \"Evil Mode\" we get to play as the Balrog, the Witch King, Grima Wormtongue, and even Sauron himself.  Winning one of the Evil chapters earns bonus items which can then be used back in the main portion of the game.  This part is worth playing both for the items as well as the joy of using the Balrog and other main enemies.\"Lord of the Rings: The Third Age\" is a really well made game.  It was a lot of fun for me to play, though I can see someone expecting an immersive RPG experience being disappointed.  The main characters of this game do not really have personalities to speak of, though at least they are quite different in combat.  Fans of Lord of the Rings should be in for a treat, though.  This is a beautiful looking game and if the player is open to an RPG style slower paced combat, this is a game that could be a lot of fun.  It took me around 22 hours to beat the game with 100% of the tasks.-Joe Sherry","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"Great, but not Excellent","reviewText":"I'm not here to give my review of Steam, which from the looks of things most of the reviewers here are rating (in lieu of the game itself). My only comment on that subject is this: I don't claim to be the most technologically adept computer user in the world, but I will say up-front that I have not had any problems with Steam. It does it's own thing, downloads patches and updates regularly, and pretty much keeps to itself. The only issue I've had with it to date is that when I open up the menu it is alarmingly too big for my display. However this probably has more to do with my screen settings rather than the program itself. Nuff' said.Half-Life 2: Episode One picks up pretty much where HL2 ended. When we last saw the game's hero, Gordon Freeman, he had just been placed in stasis by the G-Man. Without giving away too much plot, at the beginning of E1 Gordon is unexpectedly rescued from his holding area and placed back into our world near the remains of the Citadel. After reuniting with Alyx and Dog the game has you re-enter the Citadel to turn off, or at least delay its self-destruct program. Here players are reunited with potentially the coolest weapon from HL2, the Super Gravity Gun. In truth I do love this super weapon of uber-arse kicking, but much like the first game there are times I'd rather have had a good old-fashioned sidearm in my hand.The plot then carries the two forward, or rather *under* City 17 into long-forgotten passages. Here players can access flares, a new addition to the game. These are short-lived items though and are almost all universally put in places that don't warrant retrieving them in the first place, ie; flares kept in a room swarming with Zombies, etc. As such you'll rely heavily on your in-built flashlight to navigate most of the first half of the game. Also of note are the addition of \"Zombines\", zombified Combine troops who have LOTS of hitpoints and a suicidal grenade attack. Others have mentioned that this middle part of the game felt akin to Doom 3, and that's probably as accurate an assessment as you can get. The settings are claustrophobic and cramped and paranoia abounds.Once you break out onto the surface you largely return to the standard gameplay of HL2 with no noticeable changes, save for some minor plot developments. For instance Dr. Kleiner is now broadcasting on the citywide TV displays pushing for people to start madly procreating while they have the chance. The Citadel countdown was only delayed and before its self-destruction it will transmit a signal to the main forces of the Combine the goings-on here on Earth, promising retribution in the near-future.I can understand a lot of people's frustration with the game. The plot moves forward perceptibly but not a whole lot. This expansion doesn't really answer any big questions from the earlier HL installments, nor does it really delve into why or how the G-Man lost control of Gordon in the first place (he only has one appearance in the game, and that at the opening sequence). There aren't any new weapons, per se, rather than the player getting to use the well-liked Super Gravity Gun at the beginning of the game. The player doesn't get access to drivable vehicles like the swamp hovercraft or the dune buggy like in HL2 (which I considered to be some of the greatest additions to that game). This feels like a aesthetically pleasing add-on to a great game, with no particular plusses for itself, other than it carries the plot forward a few inches. I suspect that this game is likely meant to be \"filler\" for E2, when the new gaming dynamics are introduced.My big questions still as of yet unanswered include:Where is the G-Man?How are the Vortigaunts suddenly so powerful?Did Dog survive?Will there be player-usable vehicles in E2?Can we expect Corporal Shepherd (from HL1: Opposing Force) to make some appearance as he's still under the control of the G-Man?Where is TFC2? (rhetorical vapor-ware related question ;D)Solid game with the same great gameplay, just not enough of it to warrant 5 stars. I'm still looking forward to E2 to answer these many questions and more!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2006"}

Even as a free game, the time cost isn't worth it. Remember me has some great ideas, but stale, repetitive gameplay makes this a forgettable title. Stay away.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To go into more detail, Remember Me is an attempt to fuse ideas from a few good games (Uncharted and Arkham Asylum immediately come to mind) with a great story concept. The result is a horrible mash-up of elements that just don't mix, and are poorly-executed to boot.If Remember Me was graded solely on its concept, I would probably love it. The plot follows Nilin, an incredibly sexy French girl who has lost all of her memories (if it seems strange that I am mentioning her sex appeal, read on for the reason). During a final mindwipe session, she hears the voice of an old colleague who claims that her life is about to end as she knows it, and instead he plans an escape for our heroine. The story seems like a cut-and-paste of some of Philip K. Dick's stories (We Can Remember For You Wholesale and Paycheck come to mind), but that's a good thing. Sci-fi should be more omnipresent in video games.Unfortunately, the developer has taken the low road in developing this story. Your plot will be delivered to you through a glut of cutscenes (which cannot be skipped), and the lore of your surroundings is delivered through collectables. Thus, as in many Japanese games (both developed and published), there is a complete disconnect between the character you watch on the screen and the character you control in the game. For me at least, the cut scenes served as little more than a break in the action, which is unfortunate when a game's story has the potential that Remember Me does.Nilin is one of the most boring characters I can remember in a game. It's not that her voicework is bad (actually, the voices in this game are pretty good, by video game standards). She's just boring. Her only asset is her as...uhhh, derriere. I mean, just look at the cover of the game. That pretty much sums up Nilin.Gameplay completely wrecks the proceedings. Here again, a high concept is laid low by reprehensibly lazy development. Early on, you learn that your character has the ability to interact with the minds of other characters (both NPCs and enemies). in particular, she has the ability to re-write a person's memories, in instant time. She can also steal memories from people, and use her power to overload the brains of enemies. That alone should be awesome. In fact, when I heard about the concept, I was absolutely champing at the bit to dive into an open world stealth adventure with multiple plot lines depending on how I interact with others.And then I played the game. And unfortunately, Remember Me has my character walking on linear paths with invisible walls fighting tons of generic enemies, before the proceedings are broken up by standard boss battles. When my character wasn't fighting, she was going through the slop called &#34;platforming&#34; in the PS3 generation (i.e. walking forward and hitting a button when you can't go anywhere). This kind of platforming has been stale for years now, and it certainly isn't improved here. Fighting isn't much better. Trying to take a page from Arkham Asylum, Remember Me attempts to base its combat on a free-flow system, where timing, dodging and counters are the key. What a shame that it doesn't work at ALL. You initially start with a 3 hit combo, although later you can unlock larger combos. In addition, you also unlock button presses to put in these combos. It's hard to describe in words, but I'll try. You are initially allotted 3 button presses (all of which are square). Thus, you can fill a single 3-hit combo. Later, you unlock a 5 hit combo, and three more button presses. Thus, you can fill three slots of your new 5-hit combo, or borrow button presses from your 3 hit, and fill a full 5-hit combo (actually, that's not entirely accurate, but I don't feel the need of explaining the minutiae of this stupid system). Amass more experience, and you will gain more combos and button presses, until by the end, you have multiple filled combos to do what you want.The problems is I never saw much need to go beyond the 3-hit combo for non-boss battles. In short, I would hit an enemy twice, and jump over him. Hit him twice more (your combo won't break, so you will gain the 3-hitter, as well as begin a new 3-hitter), and jump over him. Rinse. Repeat. Sometimes I might get swarmed, but even on the hardest difficulty, this served me through most fights. Early on, you also learn finishing moves (such as the memory overload mentioned above), which shorten battle. But it's a boring affair, only made interesting because the platforming segments are even more so.Bosses are more interesting, but only slightly so. For example, early on, you learn how to go into special combat modes which ignore defense. This is useful, as the first boss defends well. So, you charge up, go into your special mode, and beat him down. Then, you run away while you charge again. This can be sped up immensely by augmenting your 3-hit combo to lower &#34;cooldown&#34;, but really, this is only necessary if you want trophies. Other bosses have similar shticks.The worst aspect of the game is the collectables. As I said earlier, gameplay progresses on rails. Well, mostly. Occasionally, though, an invisible wall might break down, allowing you access to a separate small path, on which will lie one of the games many collectables. If collectables were only lore, that would be one thing. But in fact, much of your character development depends on finding these collectables! It makes no sense in this type of game to put so many collectables about, and it further ruins the game.And finally, we get to the most disappointing and downright distressing part of this train wreck. Earlier, I mentioned that our heroine had the ability to complete re-write the memories of NPCs. During the game, if I recall correctly, you do this exactly 4 times. Moreover, you must re-write memories in a specific way. To give an example, in the initial re-write, you must convince a would-be assassin that in fact, the man she is working for killed her beau. You are sent into one of her memories, and given the ability to alter small portions of it to serve your purposes. One thing I immediately did was change the memory so that the doctor tried to kill the bounty hunter, and was told this was a &#34;memory bug&#34; with the explanation that &#34;you can't remember your own death!&#34;. What? It seems perfectly reasonable that you would remember your own death (or attempted death). After all, I'm attempting to implant a memory that your husband died, when he's clearly still alive. Why can't I just implant that you died, or nearly so?You might take me to task for this, but the point is the following: this mechanic has a ton of potential, and it isn't developed in the least. Re-writing memories is just a MacGuffin. It serves no purpose in the grand scheme other than as a plot coupon to continue delivering the game's storyline. I could just as well offered the would-be assassin her favorite fast-food burger.And this really crystallizes the problem of Remember Me. The ideas are great. But the implementation is lazy, and as with anything, the devil is in the details. It's not worth the 10 hours invested, even for free. I only give it two stars because, in the hands of a capable developer, this could have been a tour de force. I salivate at the idea of Eidos developing another Deus Ex around some of these ideas.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Daniel Roskeland","summary":"On world 6 already and got it just 12 hours ago.. This game is... AMAZING!!!!","reviewText":"So far, I've been playing this game for 9 hours straight and I'm loving every minute of it.I'm the kind of person to take my time with video games. I like to find little secrets and hidden passages. So far I've gotten every green star (and stamp) in every level up until 6-2. I need to take a rest though. My eyes are killing me..Anyway, more about the game!It is absolutely a MUST if you own a wii u. The level designs are completely original and replay worthy. They're set up in a way that doesn't make it insanely difficult getting to the top of every flag pole, and getting every green star. I'm not happy, or upset about this (as some gamers are pretty peeved off saying it's \"WAY too easy\".. Trust me, this isn't true. It's got some hair ripping levels just like SMG1&2). In the end of the day, it's a video game.. and I had lots of fun!Anyway, there are many little details you'll notice in this game that will make you go \"OH MY GOD... LOOK AT _____ ! Me, my two little brothers, and my sister were playing multiplayer for about an hour and it was MADDNESS! So many laughs and so much fun! It's pretty much like new super mario bros wii&wiiu;, except you can walk in all directions and (obviously) do more intricate things. I strongly recommend buying this game if your family enjoys mario multiplayer.The artistic design to this game is amazing as well, I can't express how happy I am to see mario in HD. The worlds look more beautiful than ever..Another thing I really enjoyed is that there are 4 different characters always at your disposal! With certain strengths and weaknesses, it's great if you're having trouble with a level and one of the other characters can ease the pain a little with faster running/higher jumping/levitating.I also enjoyed the throwback looks they gave the characters icons! Made me feel like I was little kid again. I also enjoyed the fact that on the map, you're not secluded to just using the directional pad to automatically move you from one world to the next.. Nope! You walk around the map in free direction! Amazing!I give it a 10/10. I love this game, worth the money for sure..****UPDATE  11/26/13******Just beat the 8th world, I've gotten every star and stamp up until the first level of the star world!! Beware, the star world can get very frustrating if you're trying to get all the green stars and stamps..Anyway, I was not disappointed with this game at all. The last boss did justice to it. I was very pleased. It was challenging to the point where it wasn't annoying, but fun. It made me laugh and go \"all right let's try again\" whenever I died, not throw the the remote across the room and say \"THATS IT IM DONE\" Like some previous mario games! So I was pleased with that!But If you're a hardcore mario fan looking to unlock/collect everything. This game probably gives out a good 20-25 hours of gameplay in order to beat it. (And that's not including the star world) so it's pretty decent.I strongly recommend this is if you own a wii u as it's a whole different animal from the other mario games you've ever played. It's not familiar territory at all, it brings a breath of fresh air to the franchise and it's exactly what I needed!****UPDATE 12/6/13*****Getting all the green stars and stamps in star world, mushroom world, fireplant world, and crown world Is HARD.Jesus.. I'd like to see all the people who are saying this game is \"too easy\" try and beat some of these levels. Some of em require intense concentration. Not to mention, while you're concentrating on not dying.. you have to remember to find all the green stars and a stamp!I'm still working on the crown world and It's pretty tough. Can you do it without using the invincible leaf? Cause there have been times where I contemplated whether i should use it or not. THAT'S how frustrating it got. A mario fanatic tried to cheat his way through a level...but I didn't. You just have to concentrate, and eventually you'll be able to do it without any help.I strongly recommend this game as it has a great amount of content on it!Also, you unlock a secret character in star world. That's 5 players to choose from! Pretty sweet if you ask me. It's a great selection for anybody.Cheers for Super Mario!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Make the games and they will come!","reviewText":"Mario is on a mission.  It&#8217;s not to protect Princess Peach or go karting with a dozen of his closest friends (and, strangely, several of his enemies) or have an epic, smashing throw-down with a bunch of other characters in the gaming universe.  No, his mission is simple.  Make sure his Japanese creators in Kyoto have a smashing holiday and foreseeably good future by selling lots of shinny new Wii Us.Upon initial reveal, consumers weren&#8217;t too thrilled with what they saw: a sequel to an (admittedly superb) handheld title, &#8220;Super Mario 3D Land&#8221;.  While &#8220;3D Land&#8221; is without a doubt a key highlight in the 3DS library, gamers were concerned &#8220;3D World&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t have the same expansive gameplay as the Galaxy games.  However, the more gamers saw in the ensuing months, the more delighted they became, and for good reason.  Like its predecessor, &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; aims at capturing both the ever ravenous 2D Mario fanbase with the lesser (but equally devoted) 3D fanbase. 2D Marios simply outsell 3D Mario games by vast margins, and by combining the play elements of both styles, Nintendo wants to expand Mario&#8217;s already dominant marketshare.  For the first time we get to see Mario multiplayer in a 3D title.The Wii U has, admittedly, had a very difficult first year.  The console has not moved unites like its elder brother, the Wii, and there have been complaints and confusion by consumers who were unsure if it was an updated Wii or an entirely new console.  Despite such a long headstart on the Playstation 4 and XBOX One, the Wii U has failed to connect to a larger audience.  There have also been an dearth of games, especially in the first couple of quarters.  Former exclusives have been delayed and ported to other consoles (notably &#8220;Raymand Legends&#8221;) and Nintendo has had a hard time drumming up third party support due to low install base.Saturo Iwata (Nintendo&#8217;s President) and Reggie Fils Aime (President of the North American division) have repeatedly said the key to the Wii U&#8217;s future is Nintendo&#8217;s first party games, with &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; being a central title in that strategy.  As always, Nintendo will unlock a lot of the Wii U&#8217;s potential with this particular Mario key!For starters, &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; is brilliant, first class, on the same playing field as the critically adored &#8220;Super Mario Galaxy&#8221; games. Games like &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; are why Nintendo is still relevant in the marketplace after all these years.  Like all Mario games, &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; represent the best of simple &#8220;pick up and play&#8221; gaming.  With very few exceptions (such as the dinosaur navigating down the river), there is no need for in-depth tutorials or in-game text, just simple, platforming fun.PLOT: Nothing to see here, move along, move along!  Oh, well, if you must.  Bowser kidnaps someone other than Princess Peach who are NOT Subcons (drat!).  Mario and company must rescue them.  Same abduction story for the last three decades, with the only reason Peach evading capture this time around is so she can be a playable character in the game.  Rosalina is an unlockable fifth player.  For the first time in, oh say thirty years, we also see the Mario bros. do some actual PLUMBING WORK in the intro.  I&#8217;d be surprised if Mario still has his plumbing license, given his proclivity for all this extracurricular activities that consume his time!VISUALS:  While developers will be figuring out how to best develop for the PS4 and XBox One, &#34;Super Mario 3D World&#34; proves the Wii U is no slouch.  Without a doubt, this is the PRETTIEST, most stunning Mario game to date, all running at 60 FPS.LEVELS:  There is a wide variety of levels that go far outside the standard Mario level tropes.  Like its predecessors before it, &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; effortlessly tosses off brilliant platforming challenges and unique game design ingenuities before rapidly moving on to other glories.  Often times developers would build entire games around stand-alone ideas that Nintendo only uses for a level or two before swiftly moving onto yet another platforming miracle. While there are the standard levels (grassy, fire and water, etc), Nintendo has fit in so much creativity and so many ideas that, paired with the HD visuals, the results are breathtaking. There&#8217;s even a brief homage to &#8220;Super Mario Kart&#8221;.  There is a shooter stage (which Miyamoto wanted in the orignal &#8220;Super Mario Bros&#8221; and which the cloud sections are left-over remnants of that idea).  For the first time in Mario history the World Map is free roaming rather than stringent paths and holds the promises of many secrets!  We have a top down Zelda-type stage. The levels have a lot of replayability, as sometimes only certain characters are unable to unlock all the secrets of a certain level.POWER UPS:  The Cat Suit is getting the most digital type and most marketing, but for my money, the Double Cherry is one of the most inventive new game ideas I've seen yet in a series that seemingly holds the patent on inventiveness and ingenuity.  By touching the double cherry, you make a clone of yourself.  By touching another one, you make yet another clone, with up to four clones for each player.  Five Marios at once is atonishing; when you incorporate multiplayer and have five Marios and five Princess Toadstools running around at the same time the effect is amazing.  The Boomerang Suit and Racoon Suit are also avaialble.  Finally, twenty eight years after we first rescured Princess Peach, we get to see her use a Fire Flower!MULTI PLAYER:  First introduced in &#34;New Super Mario Bros Wii&#34; in 2009 and continued in &#34;New Super Mario Bros. U&#34;, multiplayer has been hectic at best and chaotic at worst for Super Mario.  The 2D courses of the those two games are largely built for one player, and adding three more moving sprite models is frantic to say the least and often very difficult.  While there are still some very minor camera issues in four player, for the first time multi-player feels like a natural extension of a Super Mario game, rather than a much touted &#8220;new&#8221; feature.The most marked difference this time around is rather than feature co-op play, instead each player is directly competing against the others, and whoever scores the most gets to wear a crown on the next level.  This competitive game play adds a whole other dimension otherwise lacking to the Mario series, and would have served the two &#8220;New&#8221; titles well.  Multiplayer in Mario really needed the three dimensional space and competitive play to realise its full potential.  Likewise, when lives are running low (which they can, amazingly), sometimes it is better to collaborate with your fellow players, with each person finding the player that best suits their skill and helping the others as well to get through the level.MULTIPLE CHARACTERS: For the first time since &#8220;Super Mario Bros. 2&#34; in 1988 (Doki Doki Panci decriers be damned!), you are able to choose between four playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad.  Rather than be gameplay clones like in the &#8220;New&#8221; games, each have their own unique flavor, modelled after &#8220;SMB2&#34;, which creates interesting situations in multiplayer.CHALLENGE: The first four or five worlds do not present anything terribly difficult, but like &#8220;3D Land&#8221; the extensive post-game content provides plenty of in-depth challenge to make platforming buffons out of even the so called &#8220;Mario&#8221; master players.EXTRA CONTENT: There is lots of post game content just like 3D Land.  There are three green stars hidden per level, and also stamps which you can share in Mii-verse (and the closet thing we&#8217;ve seen to achievements yet in a Nintendo title).SOUNDTRACK AND CAPTAIN TOAD:  The soundtrack perfectly blends new music with revisited classics from the series.  The music is fully orchestrated, a la the Galaxy titles.  Throughout the world map there are Captain Toad levels, which are puzzle worlds where you control a Toad that cannot jump.  Nice bonus content and reminds me of Pushmo.CONS:-&#8216;Super Mario Bros. 2' is my all-time favorite Mario game from a sentimental standpoint, and I love the homage to &#8220;SMB2&#34; in &#8220;3D World&#8221;.  I was disappointed not to see Wart, Mouser, Tryclyde, Clawgrip, or Fryguy after all these years.  Also, the Subcon looking creatures all Sprixies.-In 2013, there is still no online multiplayer.Mario is no stranger to the task set before him by his Japanese masters.  Mario has always sold systems.  With such brilliant design as afforded to Mario, how could he not?  Without a doubt, this is easily one of the key games to pick up for a Wii U.  For the &#8220;Super Mario 3D Land&#8221; detractors. &#8220;Super Mario 3D World&#8221; proves to be a defining moment in Mario&#8217;s storied career, perfectly bridging the 2D games and &#8220;Super Mario 64&#34; and the &#8220;Galaxy&#8221; titles.  When the eight generation is drawing to a close, &#8220;Super Mario 3D Land&#8221; will be held up as one of the defining, must-play games of its era.Don&#8217;t miss it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Future sees the duo fighting an ancient race known as the Cragmites that Ratchet's lombax ancestors supposedly destroyed. Ratchet learns more about his ancestors dark past and must stop the evil Emperor Tachyon before he annihilates the last of the lombax race: Ratchet.The game hasn't changed in the past nine years and this is both good and bad. The tried and true action platforming formula that revolutionized the platforming genre is still intact here, but with no upgrades. Ratchet can jump around, hover, glide, fly, roll, and shoot his way through hordes of enemies. The game is also a third person shooter that allows strafing from side to side, and a first person mode. You have to go around worlds finding certain gadgets and weapons to kill bigger badder enemies and unlock areas. Gadgets range from the classic Slingshot and Gravity/Grind Boots to the new Geo Laser (that uses the SixAxis to guide it), the Hover Wings (also uses SixAxis), and more. Weapons include the Combuster, Shard Repeater, Tornado Launcher (that uses SixAxis to guide the tornadoes), Death Springs, Predator Missile, and more. There are some defensive weapons like the awesome Grovatron which shoots out  disco ball and makes the enemies dance. The Morph gun turns enemies into penguins while the Gelenator uses green jello goop that lets you jump to higher areas in certain levels. All the weapons are original, creative, and really fun to use. Some enemies are weaker to other weapons which makes weapons gained in the beginning useless towards the end so there are balancing issues.Weapons can be upgraded automatically from use or you can do it yourself by collecting Raritanium and upgrading at weapon stations. You can also buy new weapons as well as armor, and gadgets like Leech Bombs. Buying items in the game requires nuts and bolts that are collecting from killing enemies or breaking open boxes. There are also some ammo boxes spread throughout the level so keep and eye out for those. There are also life boxes that you can collect, but these tend to be rare thanks to the game's high difficulty. Yeah the game is really hard because not only are the bosses hard, but later on in the game  few hits will kill you even if your health is past the 200 range. I found this very frustrating plus no matter how much you upgrade your weapons you never feel like they're powerful enough which leads to ammo issues. This is a huge downfall on the game, and I hope the new game fixes this problem.If you really love just killing enemies you can go into the infamous gladiator stages and earn yourself some serious bolts by beating waves of enemies with certain instructions. These can range from only using your wrench, weapons switching automatically, to even boss fight tag teams. Some people are probably wondering about Clank. Well he gets his own upgraded and improved levels using the mysterious Zoni as his helpers instead of the little robot Clanks. You can levitate across gaps, order them to repair things, and the newest addition is slowing down time. Clank's sections haven't been updated too much, but it's enough to keep you from getting bored.You can also collect gold bolts and unlock skill points to buy some costumes in the extras menu, but they aren't that great so only hardcore fans should indulge.Another side note that I have to mention is that the game uses the SixAxis really well from diving from the sky, to using the weapons, to even shaking your booty in a pirate dancing mini-game...yeah only in Ratchet & Clank. One of my favorite mini-games is the new \"tilt-the-ball\" type hacking game which has a spark running from circuits and you have to tilt the controller to guide a metal ball to connect the gaps so the spark can reach its node. The game throws a lot of new stuff at you at  good rate so this keeps you from getting bored. I just wish that the game weren't so hard so it could be more enjoyable. What makes the game even harder is the checkpoints are far and few in between. You can finish half a level then have to start over from the beginning: Not good.If you think Future suffers from a lot of problems it does. The huge difficulty problem, poor balancing, and not so next-gen graphics make you really consider this for a purchase, but with a super funny story, loveable characters, and great weapons it makes up for all those shortcomings. The Groovitron alone is worth the play through.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

It helps if you're not drunk and with loud people when you're playing it, it tends to distract you from the thousands of zombies in various stages of 'coming after you'and no matter how many you manage to kill there's always more and more shuffling your way.

The save feature is also annoying but I think it was used to increase the non-linear play scheme of the game, yet end up following a linear path anyway.

You can just run around and shoot people and get the cops on you if you can't beat a mission. The weapons are a pistol, uzi, ausalt rifle, sniper rifle, flamethrower, grenade, cocktail, a machine gun, and a bazooka. There are over 80 missions to beat, with all these other things that you can do for fun to. Like, if you jack a fire truck you can go around putting out fires. If you jack a police car you can kill some criminals. If you jack an ambulance you can help the injured. And if you jack a taxi you can give rides to people. There are tons of cars you can take from people. Ranging from a diesel all the way to a very fast inferno. There are three islands with different missions. You start on Portland and have to move to the next island when you complete ever mission on it. This is the best game for PS2. Go out and buy it now. I bought it without renting or testing it first. The previews just looked good enough for me.  The Game is awesome.  I can't stop playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2002"}

In the opening scene of the game the town is destroyed by a demonic Goliath known only as 'The Beast'.Cole and Zeke escape to the southern city of New Marais as the Beast destroys its way down the east coast in pursuit. While there Cole is involved in many similar missions and quests as before. The blast shards, the dead drops, the upgrades, the factions...they are all back. Unfortunately so are the problems. I am sick to death of Cole clinging like a magnet to surfaces that I don't want to touch, it makes it very hard to escape conflict or to complete race missions. The camera can be a bit spinny on occasion too.New Marais is a more visually striking city too, and is more fun to fly around in than the dull, gray environment of the previous game. There are more likeable characters this time around, which makes the grind through the story missions more endurable. If you still have a saved game on your system from Infamous the sequel will use that save to instantly upgrade your character upon starting, which I thought was cool.If there will ever be an Infamous 3 I will give it a go, but Sucker Punch need to mix it up a little bit and fix those annoying flaws.

There is always a solution. It reminds me of Demon Soul's difficulty except you have checkpoints throughout the level not only at the very beginning (mean it is easier.)  I'm confident on Easy difficulty it would feel about as hard as the default difficulty in an old Crash game.The game looks gorgeous and it maintains a perfect framerate regardless of all the objects on the screen at once. With one or two exceptions (explosion + Giant Knack + Sunstone power = 1 second of slowdown).The game actually encouraged me to seek out some more PSN friends because of the gadget collecting. Having more friends who are also playing knack genuinely improved the experience.Player 2's Robo Knack is strange. It is obviously a tacked on addition but it works really well as a support character. Robo Knack's health works in a very interesting way and he can even tap into your sunstone power.  In the harder difficulties I'd almost say he's required to not pull your hair out. A scene that'll take 2-3 tries with robo knack may take 6-10 tries alone.I took 1 star off because basically I'm being exceptionally forgiving of this game. As a launch platformer it should be more accessible but it is not.  If you're the type who gets frustrated with games or someone who wants that Mario 64 experience, I don't recommend this.  But if you're someone who wants a challenge, a sort of light hearted story with plenty of mystery, and a very satisfying combat system - this is awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

Just could not get enough of it. So I was looking forward to BF Vietnam. Unfortunately, the game has been a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong. This is a solid game. Just not what one would expect from the franchise. Here's why I do not like it.For one, the game too often leaves you guessing at what happened. In BF1942, one often got killed in surprising ways as well. But here, at times it seems to be impossible to even spawn.The gameplay itself just doesn't quite feel right. I am not sure why. There are some obvious things such as the vegetation getting in the way (although this is nowhere near being the jungle environment I expected), but there also is something else. Although I can't quite figure out what. The game just does not play as well as BF1942 did.The graphics are a major disappointment. They are not overly impressive. I do not care what some of my fellow reviewers say. This is not top-of-the-line anymore. Especially things like the water just do not seem like water to me (not even like swampy water). At the same time, performance is not great. In times where games have to compete against works of art such as FarCry, this just isn't impressive anymore.I like the &quot;rock and roll&quot; gameplay with songs from the era licensed. It is great to ride into battle on a chopper that has the radio tuned to some great music. However, time spent in helicopters is not that much, and other than that, the sound seems strangely missing. I have been trying to find out whether there are some option settings or anything else I might have wrong, but wasn't able to find anything. For some reason, most vehicles hardly seem to make any noise at all.At the end of the day, this is a good game, but not nearly what I had expected. Some people argue that this should have been an expansion, and in some ways I agree. I am sure I will be seen on some BF Vietnam servers, although for most of my BF 'needs' I am more likely to return to 1942.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2004"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Excellent Campaign","reviewText":"Resistance 3 is an excellent first person shooter.  I tend to prefer FPS games on the Xbox 360 because I find the controller layout to be better for FPS games than the PS3 conroller.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and fun the controls were in Resistance 3 compaired to other exclusive FPS games like Killzone.STORY:  Resistance 3's story is different from most FPS games, and most video games in general.  It's not about some super soldier from another planet or a cyborg augmented all to hell.  It's about a father who loves his family and will do anything to protect them.  The protagonist in Resistance 3 is fragile, both physically and emotionally, which I connected with more than most protagonists who are emotionless robots with superhuman strength (I'm looking at you, Halo).  The plot is straight forward, but not dumb.  With humanity's numbers dwindling against the alien foe, the Chimera, Joe makes a tough decision to leave his family and go to New York in a desperate attempt to bring down the Chimera once and for all, sacrificing his own life to save the ones he loves.  Along the way he meets new friends and hits a few snags, but all the while it is love that carries him on.GAMEPLAY:  The best part of Resistance 3 is the gameplay.  Each level of the game is different, and you're always presented with new challenges and new weapons.  The game has a lot of variety, yet never strays far from what it is, a first person shooter.  Enemies are clever and will force you to stay on your toes.  The direct approach is not always the best, and the variety of weapons allow you to stratigize on the battlefield.  Every weapon feels right, meaning that when you pull the trigger, you get the visual and audio feedback you want and expect these weapons to have.  This makes for a very satisifying experience.  One unexpected aspect of Resistance 3 is how scary some of the levels are.  There are a few levels where you are alone and surrounded by darkness, and all you have is a small flashlight to guide you.  The enemies will burst out of pods near you and then come screaming toward you and scare the living crap out of you.  These levels were unexpeced and a nice addition.  Bosses are also fun, and most of them are so big you'll wonder how you'll possibly bring them down.  And it isn't easy.  Along the 9 to 10 hour campaign there wasn't a dull moment.GRAPHICS:  This is the weakest aspect of the game.  The polygon modeling is good, the animation is well done, but the resolution and textures are weak.  The game runs in 720p, but when compaired to other PS3 exclusive titles that run in 720p like God of War 3 or Uncharted 2, Resistance 3 looks blurry and out of focus.  The textures are also low resolution, meaning that if you come within 6 feet of any object, the texture maps look blurry, and the closer you get the worse they look.  By contrast, in Crysis 2 (which predates this game AND is not developed exclusivly for PS3) textures do not lose clarity unless you press your nose up against them.  All of this adds up to the game not looking high definition, and doesn't stack up when compaired to other modern FPS games.  Fortunately, this is a small complaint and doesn't effect gameplay.  The game is still fun, but won't wow you with it's visuals.SOUND:  Another strong point.  The music is atmospheric and lends well to the mood of the game.  It will ramp up when surrounded by enemies, or tone down when wandering the dark sewers alone.  The music sounds great and serves the game very well.  Voice acting is strong.  The acting is not flat and emotionless, nor is it over the top and campy.  Every character feels real, and their emotion comes through belivably.  Sound effects are also a highlight.  These guns, which do not exist in real life, sound the way you'd expect them to in real life.  No small feat.  Also, small effects, like foot steps and wind, are subtle and lend a hand in making the world around you feel alive.  Resistance 3 sounds especially good with headphones where you can hear every nuance of the world around you.MULTIPLAYER:  Unfortunately, Resistance 3 requires a PlayStaion Pass to play online.  You get this pass free if you purchase a new copy of the game, but if you buy used or rent (which I did), you will have to pay $10 to access online features.  As such, I did not get to try them out.  I was dissapointed in the decision to disable online play for rentals, as a good multiplayer mode can extend the life of a game from 10 hours to 100 hours, and make the difference between a rental and a purchase.  Oh well...If you're buying Resistance 3 for it's single player campaign, you won't be dissapointed.  Although the graphics aren't great, everything else is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new.

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Front Runner for Best Game of 2010","reviewText":"This game is incredible. I wasn't a big fan of the first but this one does everything right. I came across no bugs and glitches that was problematic for me for the first game. This one also implements the cover mechanic from Gears of War and it works perfectly. Everything is now streamlined without having a cluster of useless items in your inventory. It plays more like a shooter but makes upgrades and enhancements like that of an RPG.There is no travelling to each planet to explore. Now you have to just send out a probe if you uncover something by scanning to gather minerals but if they uncover an anomaly on the planet than you can land and explore. Those missions are pretty direct and fun without getting lost in big open area.The voiceovers and animations are even better than the first. It has an all-star cast and the detail of the characters and the environment is amazing for such a big game. The characters you gather as a part of your squad are all unique and have their own story to tell, if you wish, you can gain their loyalty by completing a personal mission of their own. These seem to have ramifications later on in the game.I highly recommend this game. It is ridiculous for anyone to pass this game up. It does a great job of balancing itself as a better shooter than the last and have great RPG elements that would make fans of both genres have an enjoyable experience! This game will be a serious contender for game of the year. The climatic last sequence in this game is a memoriable experience that was well designed and unique.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

Although they can get a bit hot, otherwise the comfort level is perfect, with big, nicely padded contact points all round. My only real complaint is that the headphones do not seem to have as good dual channels for speech from teammates and sound from the game. You can emphasize one, but it always at the expense of the other. Other Turtle Beach headsets I've owned had better balance. There are other design questions as well.Turtle Beach has tried several different methods of powering their headphones and transmitting audio and they've finally settled on a cable leading from the controller. Previous headsets had built in batteries and required charging. No longer. Turtle Beach has also apparently given up on the bluetooth transmitter set up that never worked quite right. The downside is that you are tethered to the controller. For the most part its no big deal, but the cord does get tangled up from time to time. More concerning is the fact that your controller batteries drain twice as fast. When they die, the resulting strain causes the controller to suddenly stop working, which is extremely annoying.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A crowning achievement","reviewText":"The classic Super Mario 64 re-defined the platformer for a new generation of gamers.  The long anticipated Super Mario Galaxy, what I consider to be the true sequel to Super Mario 64 (sorry Super Mario Sunshine!) re-defines the modern day platformer once again, and is a crowning achievement for the license, Nintendo, the Wii, and video games in general.  Princess Peach is in dire straits once again in Bowser's clutches, and Mario embarks on an interstellar quest to save her.  The first thing you'll no doubt notice are the game's incredibly stellar graphics.  The Wii is far from a technical powerhouse, but Super Mario Galaxy is by far the absolute best looking game to hit the Wii yet.  The game's new take on gravity, physics, and puzzles combine to make for some of the most excellent level designs you'll ever come across in your mission to save Peach and collect stars, and the flawless Wii-mote controls only make the gameplay experience even better.  There are a bunch of new Mario suits to enhance your abilities (some are easier to get a hang of than others), and the platforming elements, even though they've been taken to new levels here, are a Mario fan's dream come true.  If there's any downsides to Super Mario Galaxy, it's that the gravity and physics of the environments may cause some nautiousness for some, and the semi-co-op mode could have been done better, but the overall game is so good that these are extremely minor negatives.  All in all, Super Mario Galaxy is undoubtedly the best game to hit the Wii yet, and needless to say is an essential addition to your Wii library.  For those that don't own a Wii, give Super Mario Galaxy a try, you'll be quite happy you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2007"}

The story is weak but humorous.  The gameplay is ripped straight off a Lego title but it works well.  How much you enjoy the game is probably going to be a multiplier of how much you want to spend.As everyone already knows from the multitude of reviews, the gimmick with this title is the portal of power.  The portal hooks up to your Wii wirelessly and lets you use the toys (of which this starter pack comes with 3) in the game.  Apparently there are upwards of 30 which fall into 8 main categories.  To see everything this game has to offer, you have to have a character of each type, as well as two larger items that open up other levels entirely.  Great gimmick and much more fun I guess that DLC.  Either way?  You are still out another 60 bucks.The toys are nicely made, but unless you are a little kid, you won't likely want these just as show pieces.  So getting a full game is no longer just a DVD put a folder.  Its a dozen toys, the portal and that is just a minimum.The game can be completed with just the starter pack, but it certainly encourages more purchasing.  And frankly, as fun as the game is, I can't imagine shucking out the price of a 3DS for it.If you have the control not to want to know what is behind the locked doors and extra levels, this game is a lot of fun.

Waiting for you.\" So James goes to the town of Silent Hill that is deserted except a few people. James meets Angela Orosco in the cemetary and she is the first person he meets, who is looking for her \"mama.\" Laura, who is this little girl James meets in the apartments for the first time and she doesn't see the monsters in the town, she is very innocent. Eddie is another character who James meets in the apartments and is really never explained why he's even in Silent Hill in the first place. Maria is this woman who James meets in Rosewater Park, who looks almost exactly like his late wife. Maria tags along with James throughout a lot of the game but it's freaky that sometimes you don't know exactly what happens to her or where she is because she'll just disappear.I say this game is very morbid and twisted because of a lot of things. First, all the cryptic scriptures and notes and books. There are a couple dead people you just see lying in the street that have maps where someone drew on them and makes you wonder exactly what it means. There are also a bunch of notes written on 4 or 5 pieces of paper about something coming to kill or something like that just thrown on the street. The two books, Lost Memories and Crimson Ceremony are about rituals and just really creepy stuff, morbid stuff. Later in the game, there is this place called the Historical Society that have pictures on the walls and it's just really morbid and twisted, it kind of scares me every time I go there. Other things include a bunch a holes that you jump down and a morgue. Just about everything in this game is just really morbid at some level. It scares me so much that I only play for so long before I turn off the game. In the Rosewater Park, there is this statue that is referencing people being under the lake and makes me wonder why they would put up a statue instead of putting all these people in a real graveyard, stuff like that, morbid stuff like that freaks me out when I really think about it and that's why I like it so much. Of course in real life, I'm not into stuff like that but when it comes to video games, I just happen to like it!

Literally every single week has one top-tier title that's massively anticipated and will instantly become day one purchases for many. Call it the Summer Blockbuster Season in games, really and thankfully a game like Dead Space has generated quite a bit of excitement and won't become one of those forgotten Ico/Beyond Good and Evil-type gems that barely anyone played yet people who have sing its praises whenever they can. While it's not exactly original and there's incredibly small gripes about the gameplay, Dead Space has all the makings of a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone...provided you're over 18.Story: You play as Isaac Clarke (a little nod to Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, writer of 2001)who is an engineer that gets called in to investigate the distress beacon activated by the USG Ishimura, a \"planet cracker\" ship that literally rips holes in planets and mines the chunks for minerals and ore. But upon arrival, Isaac and a couple of his shipmates crash onto the ship and have to investigate what happened. But instead of finding its crew, it seems to be infested with new residents: that of grotesque, mutated creatures.Graphics: This game is different than say Heavenly Sword or Uncharted which had lush and colorful visuals. Dead Space is more about poor lighting, flickering light sources and shadows across the floor. That being said, the graphics are unbelievably impressive and the immersion into the environments is stellar thanks to how the ship is presented. Also notable is the gore which is decidedly ramped up and whether it's you being on the losing end or you besting your enemies, you're guaranteed to run into some gruesomeness.Sound/Music: Anyone who knows anything about horror is that it's just as much about how it's presented than what and all that is thanks to sound. The sound here is unbelievably impressive with clanks, roars and screeches, the unexpected loud encounter and even faint whispering, the aural design here will definately be effective if you have a killer surround sound system. The voice acting is also quite good and while they're not exactly flashy roles, there's no breaking the atmosphere with awful line delivery or melodramatic bellowing.Gameplay: Strangely, the PS3 version of Bioshock is being released a week after this game which is a creepy, atmospheric FPS. This is a creepy, atmospheric 3rd-person shooter similar to Resident Evil 4. But what helps the game is the completely intuitive and immediate feel in the controls. While the controlling is simple and seen before, it's the weapons and others where it becomes key since I found switching weapons in previous games slightly clunky. Basically pressing L1 makes you aim and your action depends on what button you pressed. Pressing Square activates your Stasis, a kind of slow-motion weapon for those fast enemies, or just managing the battlefield. X is Reload while Circle activates your Kinesis which works similarily to the Force Grab in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (and not as awfully done either). R1 controls your firing while R2 is the weapon's secondary mode so your first weapon, Plasma Cutter cuts horizontally in default, pressing R2 changes it to vertically which is perfect for arm dismembering while the default is great for legs. You also have several other weaponry to use, all based on mining equipment so you have one gun which has saw blades, a flamethrower or a rapid-fire pulse rifle.By the way, don't think you can rely on headshots galore in this game since that can make it worse. Instead, you have to essentially take your enemies apart to wipe them out. Blowing their legs off reduces them to a crawl while going for their arms robs them of anything to attack you with (and with Kinesis on the arms, they make for great impalement tools). That also gets a great use as well is the bigger variety in how you kill your enemies. For example, in addition to the arm-blade tactic, you can grab a flammable tank with Kinesis and launch them, creating a bomb or squishing them in doorways or getting them into gravity panels on the floor and launching them towards the ceiling with a nice, satisfying \"squish\" sound. While we're not talking about Bioshock-levels of variety, it's a great change of pace from just shoot-shoot-grenade-shoot in other games.The other thing to mention is that in order to completely immerse you in the environment, EA didn't do a traditional HUD with your health bar, ammo and mini-map in the corners of the screen. Instead, everything is on your body with a vertebrae-like meter running up your spine that drops when you take damage to a half-circle for your Stasis meter, a pop-up for Air and a visible hologram for your ammo. It's a wonder that nobody seems to do this more. Word of caution: entering your inventory does not pause the game (that's what Start is for). So this effectively can leave you wide open for enemy attacks so best to wait till the coast is relatively clear. But having video logs and transmissions coming in front of Isaac and not a separate cutscene is great.Oh, and speaking of air: on occasion you'll hit Zero-G environments where there's no air and you're able to jump to other parts of the room which lets you even stand on the walls, complete with shifted perspective. While it's disorientating and hard to tell what's exactly jumpable until you tried to jump, it quite works within the game and the near lack of sound really helps sell it. Plus let's face it: it's hard not to yell \"woohoo!\" like you're on a roller coaster every time you jump.There's a couple parts in the game where I hit a proverbial wall and died a few times (it's reminiscent of \"Star Wars\" and even has a trophy named after one of Han Solo's lines), this isn't a difficult game so much as it's intense. Only brief times I can recall where I was more overwhelmed by enemies and didn't have a good strategy as opposed to Uncharted where enemies seem to have bullet-stopping skin or Call of Duty 4 where enemies seem to have better aim at 200 yards away than you do. While you can separate the game's experience into sizable chunks thanks to the clear chapter progression, the difficulty is so inviting that you just want to keep playing and not feel like Ninja Gaiden-levels of frustration and \"finally for the 10th time!\" shouts.Is this worth a purchase? Well for me it is and I had such a blast with this game but for others, some might not get the big deal or they're too busy playing the other big games of the month to bother but I say definately do not pass this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

Unfortunately this immediately makes Echoes feel inferior.  So if you're looking for a brand new innovative game, you will be disappointed.However, as a Metroid game, it's just as engrossing and enveloping as the rest.  Storywise, this one is much darker and much more surreal.  The puzzles and the tasks that Samus must go through are MUCH more involved...sometimes to the point of frustration.  The bosses are tricky, but not unbeatable.  It'll sometimes take a few tries.  However, save points are much more scarce, which makes dying more of an inconvenience since you'll likely have to traverse a long way (solving the same puzzles) in order to try again.This game introduces having ammo for your beam weapons.  Big, big hinderance.  There seems to be no point in having this on there.  Also, the light world/dark world plotline is straight out of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, so in that respect it seems unoriginal.  And speaking of unoriginality, having Samus start fully-equipped only to \"accidentally\" lose all the powerups is repetitive and farfetched.Controlwise, it's identical to Metroid Prime.  Graphically, it's identical to Metroid Prime.  So unfortunately, this game doesn't bring a lot of new elements to the table.

I typed in lemur and there one showed up and i accidentally stepped on him and killed him :(.  There are some drawbacks to the game. Like the tutorial, very long and almost made me turn it off and play something else...i kept thinking...lets get on with it, but finally it does and you can have fun.  Also the controls dont always do what you want them to do.  The game is controlled completely by the stylus so sometimes you will touch something but it doesnt register correctly...the creators should have spent a little more time to work out all teh bugs.  but soon super scribblenauts will be out...i cant wait to see whats gonna happen there.  But for this game if you buy it ull enjoy it and it will make you laugh and challenge you mentally.  I give it 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}

It is a far superior game in every way. I am not sure what people are talking about when they said they preferred Asylum, I am assuming it was because it was the first game and they are just nostalgic. Anyway, graphics are not to good, looked like a game at least 10 years before Arkham City. Game is much smaller, fighting not nearly as tight or as varied. Riddles not even close. Fying not even close. Voice overs not quite as good. I promise you nothing is even remotely close in quality to City.  I did like this game and wished I had played it first. I am glad I played it for the story.In summary, this is a fun game, but really pales in comparison to the first. Graphics I would say are below average and fighting is not responsive enough. Story and sounds are good and compare to the second. Replayability is also not close to City.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Some of the most online fun I've had in a long while","reviewText":"One thing is completely clear from my time playing Guild Wars 2 so far and it is that the game excels where most others have issues.Instead of boring you with prose I'll just highlight my favorites and describe why I think the game does so well. After that I'll discuss some possible downsides to the game I've noticed as I've leveled up. I personally think the downsides don't really matter but others may be interested so I'll add them.Positives:World friendly battle system, Events, Shared resource nodes, No quests, World vs World, Structured PVP, Underwater combat, Skills, Traits, CraftingWorld friendly battle system:You can attack any enemy even one currently in combat with another user for a chance to gain experience and potentially loot. Unlike games that only give kill credit to one user Guild Wars 2 expects everyone to be out there helping each other. I really like how this led to some additional immersion as often you'll find yourself near death and find a group of adventurers stumble by and give you a hand without a second thought. I can imagine this would annoy soloists who want to challenge themselves but for most social folk this will be an improvement.Events:Events are dynamic occurences which can happen across the world that include objects such as defending from an onslaught of enemies, protecting a person as they complete a task, helping lay seige to a city, etc. While there are some repetitive events like the kill counts to decrease morale of the enemy events most are dynamic and a lot of fun. There are also events across zones which are chained together leading to epic boss battles that take a ton of folks to bring down. I worry about how this'll work in lesser populated zones but I haven't run into many troubles so far.Shared resource nodes:I'll be brief... nothing annoys me more in an online game when some troll swoops down with his epic level 80 flying mount and steals a node right as I'm fighting the enemies around it. The good news is in Guild Wars 2 everyone has a chance to take any of the nodes on the map.No quests:There are no normal quests like gather x and kill y for prize. There are quest-like events where you fulfill some task in a given region but there are few set rules, generally, as to how you'll accomplish that task. You may feed the cows and hen or kill worms, or have a drink, etc. They just don't feel like quests.World vs World:This has to be one of my favorite aspects of the game. In the World vs World there are four battlegrounds up for grabs with plenty of castles, towers, and supply depots to hit. Initially I had a horrible time with it though until I leveled up. They do boost your level to 80 stat wise but you lack the skills, traits, and armor/weapons of a level 80 so effectively you're squishy as can be. You can do some serious damage with seige weapons but that only really works out in your favor if the castle you're defending has one already or you have a lot of spare money as you'll be pretty tight on cash at lower levels to afford them.Structured PVP:Structured PVP is a ton of fun as well. The great thing is everyone is level 80 with equivalent gear. You can specify which traits you're using, which skills you want to use, and even which runes are attached to your armor/weapons for your kill style. Some runes give benefits when you swap weapons... the damage you do can easily be increased by specing your build to match your optimum fighting style.Underwater combat:Generally underwater combat in MMORPGs sucks completely. This is because you're fighting against your oxygen level along with your inability to do just about anything. This isn't true with Guild Wars 2. You have a separate set of weapons to swap between just for underwater combat. My personal favorite is the speargun but I see a lot of folks use spears as well. There are some current drawbacks to underwater combat I'll go over in the negative but they do it a lot better than most MMOs.Skills:Skills come in a few flavors which make for an interesting setup. The primary five skills are for the most part weapon based (I say most part because elementalists have it a bit differently although still weapon based). If you have a two handed weapon all five skills are unlockable otherwise only the first two from your primary weapon are unlockable (by beating enemies). The other three for one handed weapons come from the last two belonging to your secondary weapon and the third/middle skill being a combination of the primary and secondary weapons. On my thief I use a sword and pistol which gives me a combo technique of pistol whip which stuns the enemy by knocking him with my pistol and then slashes him with a round of sword hits. Other skills include a healing skill you can select from a few for your class, three class specific skills, and an elite skill.Negatives:Gear being worthless:One of the unfortunate (or fortunate depending upon your perspective) side effects of Guild Wars 2's mantra of skill over gear treadmill is that gear is for the most part worthless and just cosmetic. You'll spend a lot of time fighting for what is a trivial difference in power for most things. Even legendary weapons aren't that much greater than the exotic counterparts to warrant the grind to get them. I personally don't mind all that much but I always loved the romance of entering a dungeon with a group before WoW became all about stats and drops and finding something I had no idea I could upgrade with. I'm not at cap so I won't see if I experience this with their new armor they're introducing with the patch for the Lost Shores so we'll see.Shared resource nodes:While I did call this a positive I personally see some negative aspects of this as well. There always was a feeling of being one step ahead of everyone else when I found a good node in other games. Like that by collecting this supply I'd have better chances of building items that could give me an edge. On top of that I noticed most of the crafting recipes want larger than what you'd expect levels of ingredients to build so you end up needing to hit that many more nodes than other games to get the right amount of ingredients.No quests:One thing I did enjoy about WoW was my ability to get items for my character to improve his stats as I leveled up by using quests. I rarely use the trading posts in games so I rely on my drops and quests to really get upgrades as I always figure the next upgrade is around the corner. There were a few moments in my WvW days where most of my experience was event based and not kill based (I couldn't hurt the enemy enough to get any credit for the kill as my level was low) so I ended up having some really crappy gear for a good portion of the game. It made my personal story extremely difficult as waves of enemies would almost certainly kill me.No factions:There are no factions in the game which removes some of the romance around taking the enemies capital, world PVP, etc. It's not a huge loss though as WvW makes up for a lot of it and the structured PVP is fun as well.Crafting ingredients / outpacing level:This is a huge annoyance of mine but despite the fact I salvage everything I never have enough ingredients to push myself up to my current level. I did a lot of grinding for ingredients at one point and it just still isn't enough. I'm going to end up being level 80 and need to farm materials at the rate I'm going... I'm just hoping the end game crafting is worth it.No mounts:You'll find yourself running around... a lot. The warp points are fine for PVE but WvW you'll find that half of your time in the game is just running to the next keep. If you're with a good team of folks though you won't need to respawn so best to find a group and stick to it. I wish there were some mounts though although I understand their desire not to get into that sort of system.Underwater combat:As much as I love it the underwater combat is flawed for three huge reasons: 1) the spacing of enemies wasn't well planned out so you'll end up fighting like six of them at a time and dying unless you strategicly plan every move you make like a surgeon, 2) enemies have a bug where they reset and go invulnerable more often underwater than on land... it has happened to me like 10 times so far and usually results in me dying when they become normal again healed, 3) fighting one enemy underwater tends to be a lot harder than one on land. The last point may just be my inexperience with fighting underwater but I find that I lack mobility whenever I'm in that situation.That's about it. You're welcome to decide if you agree or disagree with me but aside from my own person misgivings I'm pretty happy about the game and recently bought another copy for my fiance to use I loved it so much. There are definite differences from other MMORPGs in the genre but each game stands on its own for its own values and I appreciate the complete package given by Guild Wars 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Randall","summary":"Solves the problems in the original","reviewText":"Gameboy Advance SP solves the problems that the original Gameboy Advance had.  Namely, it provides a backlight that makes the system usable in any lighting conditions.  The older version, while a technological marvel when it came to the handheld gaming platform was hampered by the lack of a backlight, the dark shadings of most of its games, and the truly atrocious external lighting accessories that could be purchased for the system.  The SP version's backlight eliminates those problems while also improving on the rest of the system.  The SP is more compact than the original advance, making it more portable.  It also has a foldover design that enables the screen to be protected when not in use, thereby avoiding the scratches the original system was susceptible to.  Finally, the system, itself, requires no batteries.  It's power source is internal and only requires a charging after about 12 of continous play.The only drawback in this system is the lack of a jack for earphones, but that is a minor, minor flaw.  This system can still play every Gameboy game every created (back to the original 15-year old system) and has a wealth of tremdenous titles at its disposal (like the Metroid series and numerous older games that get ported for the handheld platform).  Don't be put off by the SP's 3 1/2 star average rating.  Many of the negative reviewers are people who dislike Nintendo in general.  Objectively, the quality of the SP is tremendous and the titles at its disposal are incredible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2004"}

I love games like Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher, etc.  I have all of these games for XBOX360.  Bound by Flame for the PS4 couldn't hold any of those game's jock.  This game fails in so many ways.  For starters, let's talk about the presentation.  The graphics are terrible.  Next gen systems should be embarrassed to have this game played on them.  It looks like a very early PS3 title.  Not only does the game look bad, but it sounds worse.  The voice acting is laughable.  One character sounds like he's British, another like he's from Brooklyn, NY.  And I don't typically have an aversion for swearing in a video game, but the dialogue in BBF is rampant with unnecessary F-bombs.The gameplay is average at best.  The game is linear and the story is convoluted.  Fighting mechanics are ok, despite poor controller mapping.  It can be challenging, particularly early on in the game.  You'll likely die often if played on the normal difficulty level.  It has a decent level up system and looting aspects.  That's about it for the positives, if you can call them positives.If you have a PS4 and are extremely bored due to lack of released titles and you MUST pick this up, consider yourself warned.  I'd highly recommend waiting for the price point to drop below $25 before doing so.  Based on how badly is sucks, I assume that shouldn't take long.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

That, and the roster has been slightly updated.  That is, until you play through every Wrestlemania match, acheiving EVERY goal to unlock wrestlers or you want to spend money buying more wrestlers at the PS store.  Even when all content is unlocked (all wrestlers, arenas, managers, etc.) it is still lacking.  I mean, where is Golddust?  Where is the Wyatt Family?  Not in this game.  Instead, you are given 4 different versions of Hulk Hogan, from slightly balding to bald on top.  Yay.The lacking rosters aside, this is still a pretty good game.  It's fun to relive all of the old school matches from way back in the 80s.  Plus, as much as I was disappointed with the roster, you can add the NWO, albiet not the complete NWO.  Playing as the Outsiders is a damn good time.  The controls are exactly the same as 2K13, which is a good thing.  The graphics have not really improved at all.  Animations look good, but the wrestler's faces look odd.  Hit detection did improve from last year's installment.I will say that, although playing through the Wrestlemania matches can be fun, they can also be very frustrating.  There are key tasks you must complete to fully unlock the prize for winning that MUST be completed.  If they are not, you won't unlock the new wrestler, ring, championship belt, etc.  And they are not always easy.  I found myself dominating Randy Savage as Hogan, but I was tasked with whipping him into the steel stairs.  In trying to do this, I ended up getting pinned.  Annoying.For WWE fans, it's fun and nostolgic and worth picking up.  I wouldn't pay $60 for it, however.  If you can pick it up for around $40, it's well worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2014"}

I can't quite remember whether or not these were outstanding for their time, but they certaintly aren't on the highest level of what the PS1 can achieve.  The cutscenes are done in a 2-D anime style, which just feels timeless and classic.  Thus, I'll give the graphics an overall average score of \"7\".Music (score 9/10): The music is very good.  Everything feels like it belongs and nothing particularly grates on your ears.  The battle music is upbeat and enjoyable.  Some of the music is quite memorable.  In fact, it's good enough you might buy the soundtrack.  So, no complaints at all.Characters (score 10/10): This is what characterization is all about!  The main characters are all extremely well developed and interesting.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and backstory.  This is what makes an RPG good (aside from the story, of course).  Fei (your main character) is particularly well-developed.  He seems to be suffering from a fictionalized form of Dissociative Identity Disorder.  I love it when my video game characters are mentally ill!  Even characters that you might think are just comic relief later prove themselves to be multifaceted and complex.  This section gets a perfect score from me.Story (score 10/10): Is there even a word for how awesome the story is?!  Among of sea of standard \"save the world from generic evil bad guys\" plots this game really stands out as unique.  I mean, the storyline deals with some surprisingly mature topics for an RPG (including themes of religion, the nature of memory, prejudice, reincarnation and even cannibalism).  The story might be even better than the much touted storyline of Final Fantasy VII (and I love that game immensely, so I'm really giving Xenogears high praise).Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based, but unique compared to the more traditional turn-based games like Final Fantasy or Grandia.  Basically you have AP which are points that you can use to perform strong, moderate or weak hits (these are mapped to various buttons, like the triangle button and the O button).  You use up your AP for the turn and then perform a string of attacks.  Certain combinations are Deathblows which are much stronger attacks.  There's also more traditional magic attacks to choose from and such.  This system, although similar to more traditional RPGs, feels somehow fresh and different.  It's a bit more complex than just choosing the \"attack\" option.  The only downside is that it can feel a bit tedious having to input all those commands sometimes.Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The menus are fine.  This game was a bit unusual at the time because it features a rotating camera.  In other words, the camera isn't fixed - you can rotate a full 360 degrees.  For the most part this works fine and navigation isn't too confusing.  I must complain a bit about dungeon design, which can be a bit confusing.  A whole lot of the dungeons are rather maze-like and easy to get lost in.  Whether or not this bothers you will probably depend on your sensibilities as a gamer, but I found just a little nerve-wracking (and I opted to use a guide - don't shoot me!).  Anywho, the only other issue I can think of has to do with a bit of a glitch.  My copy of the game would tend to freeze up in this one area over and over again.  I eventually got past it and never had that problem again on subsequent playthroughs.  I don't know if it was just my copy of the game or if the game's programming may be prone to glitchiness or what, but I just thought I'd warn you.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this game has certainly earned its place among the \"classic\" RPGs.  If you are a serious RPG fan and somehow haven't played this game yet, I strongly suggest you pick it up.  It's rather expensive right now, unfortunately, but it's well worth having in your collection.  Go get it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"BruteNStones","summary":"Felt like I was being paid to play","reviewText":"The game was begged by my friends as a must have, I never got into it and felt like it was based around extremely linear and directed GamePlay with no real freedom and too much 'cinema'. It's main focus was for solid to be a hero and be badass, it did it in a good fashion and I reward for the efforts into character design and voice acting was above par.The game could have shined, maybe, but I was left waiting to play more than actually playing, action scenes are short non existent most of the game as you'll be mostly undetected. Each time you are allowed to play it's only for 15 minutes tops then back to cinematic performance's which just go on forever and if the gameplay was at least interesting then I surely wouldn't have an issue with the game at all.

With 2005's Mario Kart DS being an incredible game, Mario Kart Wii has a lot to live up to.  In many cases it does.  There are a few setbacks, though, but it doesn't separate it from being a fun game nonetheless.As usual, the game consist of several drivers and like the DS version, they each have an array of karts to choose from.  There are now 24 different racers.  Lightweights, mediumweights and heavyweights.  Some racers you'll have to unlock, and you can even race using your Mii.  All characters also have a choice of 12 karts, and for the first time you can use bikes as you race.There are 32 courses to race on in Mario Kart Wii.  Half of which are brand new courses while the other half are from previous outings.  You can play with friends and race in vs. in direct competition or on teams.  You can also do single player and race the Grand Prix.  Either way, you'll have to race to unlock new cups and characters. The new courses are incredibly fun and very well designed.  There are also twelve competitors in a race instead of eight  Like in previous installments there are also a good deal of items you can collect when you go through the races.  Classic items like Lightning, Boost Mushrooms and shells are back.  But there are also new items thrown in there like the Pow Block, a Lightning Cloud and the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. in there thrown in for good measure.  As usual, you get more helpful items the further behind in a race you.  They add a lot of variety to the game as a whole.There are also battle modes.  The classic balloon battle where you'll diminish a player's balloons and there's a coin battle where you'll have to collect coins.  In both battle setups you roam around grabbing item boxes to pummel your enemies.  Up to four people can battle at a time and there are twelve in a match.  The other players will be controlled by the computer  However, of all the Mario Karts, the Wii version certainly has the weakest battle mode.  You're forced into teams rather than having an all out battle and they're also timed.  It's not as much fun.  While they bring some classic battle courses, it would be nice to battle your friends in a free for all.  The AI controlled characters also aren't all that smart.  It makes the battle less fun, especially by yourself.Nintendo has incorporated many ways in which you can control Mario Kart.  There is, of course, straight motion sensor controls.  The game comes with a wheel to play with, but you don't need the wheel in order to use the Wii Remote as a wheel.  This is perfect for Mario Kart Wii and is incredibly user friendly.  If the wheel isn't working for you, you can also use the regular Wii Remote and Nunchuck setup or you can use the Classic Controller or the Gamecube Controller.  Regardless of which control scheme you use, they're all pretty tight.  While the wheel is nice, it takes a while to get used to, especially if you've been playing Mario Kart since the Super Nintendo days.Mario Kart for the Wii is fun but it suffers from one huge setback, especially in single player.  There are times when the game can be a test in frustration.  When racing, the amount of items you can be bombarded with at once is a little over the top. Especially if you go through the race in first place.  There are many moments where you'll be hit by one item and find your footing only to be hit by another item instantly (and sometimes you won't even find your footing).  This has always had the potential to happen in Mario Kart, but in the Wii version it happens regularly.  In one race for example, I was pounded by a Red Shell, Pow Block and Lightning all at the same time, losing my lead and the race. This is even more frequent on higher CC levels.  A little breathing room between being pummeled would've been nice.  But the worst part about this element, is that getting first place in several races is based more so on luck rather than your actual racing skills.  Whatever you do in one race to get 1st place, doesn't usually work on another.  This is easily the biggest problem with Mario Kart Wii.On the other hand, the Wi-fi in Mario Kart Wii shows that Nintendo is beginning to take online gaming seriously.  There's a lot of options and a lot of freedom.  While you still have to deal with friend codes, that's hardly a problem when you finally start sharing records, racing and battling online.  It all works really well.  You might experience some lag, but if you've got a good connection it probably won't be heavy.  The game also gives you the option of installing the Mario Kart Wii Channel on your Wii.  You can get on that and check rankings any time you want.  Installing the channel also makes it so you don't have to insert the game to take a look at the latest rankings.Mario Kart is a good looking game, but certainly not the best looking out there for the Wii.  It's got some very well designed tracks and happens to be a good looking game.  It's just hard not to expect it to look a little more detailed and fleshed out.  The game never slows down, though and consistently runs smoothly.  On the whole, though, Mario Kart Wii still looks better than many games out there on the Wii.  Just not up to snub with other incredible looking games like Super Mario Galaxy.  Luckily, Mario Kart Wii doesn't have to look groundbreaking and new.  It just has to play well, and it does.  Most of the music is quite forgettable, though.  None of it sounds bad, just not catchy.  However, in terms of sound, the voices will probably annoy you after a while.  You can only hear characters cry after losing or scream and yell during jumps so much before it finally gets on your nerves.  You might get used to it, but it will take some time.Mario Kart for the Wii is certainly fun.  It's a great game that's been very well built up.  The only major problem is that the Battle Modes aren't as worthwhile as previous installments and that racing against the computer can be a test in frustration from time to time.  It's still a fun game and going online is also a lot of fun.  Any Mario Kart fan will be glad to pick this up and newcomers will find comfort in the ease of picking it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

I wanted to love this one as well; however, I am not happy.  There is no doubt this is an epic game in scope as it's large and there is a lot to do when it works.The problem is I just can't bring myself to play it anymore because it's frustrating.  I do not mind Steam or Windows Live too much...yes, it is annoying, but as long as I can play the game then whatever.  The issue is there are so many collisions, bugs and crashes that are TOTALLY random.  You can start a new Grand Campaign and encounter no bugs whatsoever, but then start another game and BAM you get a crash that cannot be navigated around that is somehow attributed to one action by another nation.  For example, after about 40 years playing as Great Britain I got a hangup on Sweden's turn.  I reloaded the saves I had, tried several different things and still the crash on Sweden's turn.  That is very frustrating.  It's like playing the game with someone holding the power cord next to you and at any moment for no reason they will unplug the game and you are screwed.The game is fun when it works...there is no doubt about it, but the A.I. is like an idiot savant.  Sometimes it is a complete idiot and other times I wonder how they snuck a regiment around me to take out my artillery.Siege warfare is like a giant episode of Keystone cops.  Manning the guns is practically pointless as you get to the guns too late, and most of the time the enemy runs all the way around the fort and attacks it from the rear and is like an old Benny Hill episode minus the hot chics running around.I've actually been able to finish a whole game as Great Britain (starting all over from the bugged Sweden game) and it was pretty fun, but the whole time I was anticipating a crash.  I played it on normal/normal because everytime I tried to start a new game on Hard/Hard it would crash as soon as I selected one of my generals.I'm pretty forgiving on computer games, just because of the nature of how complicated they are to put together; however, the threat of a crash hanging over my head all the time where I have no recourse, but to suck it up and start over does not make me want to play this game anymore. The great thing about the Total War games I liked was the replayability, but why would I want to play something that may or may not screw up on me after 5 turns, 50 turns or right before I win?Pros:- Great graphics- Sound is good- Lots of nations to choose from and a host of minor nations- Gameplay is fun (when it works)Cons:- Too many bugs and crashes- Tutorial sucked- Manual sucked- Playing with the threat of a CTD hanging over your head is NOT FUN","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"Antoinette Johnson \"Pooky\"","summary":"Fun, but I still prefer the PS2 version.","reviewText":"I've already done a pretty long review on Okami for the PS2, so I'm gonna copy and paste my PS2 review and at the end tell what really makes the wii version different from the PS2. In terms of content theres really no difference between the wii and Ps2 versions of Okami. Trust me while I absolutely LOVED the Ps2 version, theres one thing about the wii version that kind of breaks it for me.PS2 review:There is so much about Okami to like! i have never played a game so original before in my life. it has to be the most underrated game this century!Okami is about the Sun goddess Ameratsu Okami who takes the form of a wolf and her little woodsprite companion issun. 100 years ago Okami known back then as Shirainu killed a evil monster called Orochi (Mountain of Darkness) by means of a warrior named Negi. Ameratsu died in the fight and in honor of her and Negi they built a monument in honor of them. Centuries later orochis evil is brought upon the world again and Okami is resurracted to battle her foe once again.The story is actually more complex than how I summarized it. There are tons of side quest, missions, and secrets in Okami. its replay value is extreme and broad because theres so many things to do and find. I still haven't beat it 100% because of the stray beads and i'm always preoccupied doing one of the most addicting things in video game history sinse pickpocketing in Sly cooper...Fishing. No words can describe how addicting fishing is in Okami. in most games its boring, but in Okami its executed in such a way that you can't stop. Fishing is also one of the best ways to earn money for supplies and new fighting techniques.Combat in okami is fun and fastpaced. Many enemies in the game require some level of strategy to defeat. You can't just hack and slash expecially later when enemies are stronger. The boss battles are huge and epic. every boss is unique and strategic. If you defeat an enemy in a cool way or buy 2 techniques that bring this on they drop a Demon fang that you exchange for goods and sometimes required items.The world is huge! After Orochi peaple make the mistake of thinking they beat the game, but really theres more story to be found. just as a warning alot of the plot and stories in Okami are based off Japenese Mythology, but thats what makes it so interesting. One in particular is a story involving a box that was given to an old man as a gift from a dragon palace, but yall can see that for yourselves.One of the biggest highlight of Okami though are the brush techniques. they are wonderful. There are actually more techniques and moves you can use that the game don't tell you about. Most you find doing side quest, but there are some that are found in secret places.The absolute greatest thing and everyone knows this is the graphics and music. Theres no game out there like this. Okami is made with beutiful japenese art. the music is also very Japenese and memorable. It is absolutely breathtaking expecially when you clean the earth. I think the PS2 version does the graphics better than the Wii. I hear peaple dote on the realistic graphics of the Xbox and PS3 but it can't compare to how breathtaking Okami is. The art style and music lead to some scary moments too. In evil or bad spots in the game the music can get extremely ominous. The creepiest and scariest area in the game for me is the ghost ship. The art and eerie music had me looking behind my shoulder and enemies that I ain't gonna describe for spoiler reasons appeared out of nowhere and scared the living daylights out of me. Think the Grudge meets Silent Hill XD Don't get me started on Mr. and Mrs. Cutter (shivers)I know peaple complain that it is too easy, but this is forgiven by how much this game offers. I admit though I did die once near the end of the game fighting these 9 dogs, but thats another story and I didn't get a game over because of my astral pouch (Fill it up with food and you don't die).This review barely touches everything in this game. Okami is one of the greatest and revolutionary video games this century. I've hoped to find more games made with unque graphics like Okami, but I can never find anyXD The only game that comes close is Mini Ninjas for the Wii (fun game), but even it can't compare to Okami. I love it so much that I'm rebuying it for the Wii and getting its DS sequal.PS2 and Wii comparisons:As stated in my PS2 review I really do like the Ps2 graphics for the game better. The wii makes it look good, but I really do love the lighter and more colorful shade the Ps2 graphics give. On the wii this game is still extremely gorgeous though expecially on a high definition flat screen. This is nitpicking a bit, but I noticed that the wii version took out a cool easter egg that allows you to get demon fangs. In the blank sheet loading screens on the Ps2 version when you press X continuosly paw prints show up. After a certain amount fill the screen you get a demon fang. A harder easter egg is on the running paw loading screen where you press X in a timely fasion to make the paws grow bigger. If all paws grow big you get a demon fang. I tried pressing A, B, +, but could never find that easter egg. It's a minor complaint, but it was disappointing that when they ported Okami to the wii they would take out such a cool feature. Speaking of features it would have been nice if they would have added something new to the wii version. Maybe levels, characters, or missions exclusive to the wii. Heck maybe even new easter eggs.Now for the thing that truely bothered me. the controls. Combat in Okami is severely handicapped in the wii version because its abdapted to wii motion controls. Anyones whos played the PS2 version, you're gonna miss the fast-paced battles. I've tried waggling the wiimote at many speeds and directions and still its only by luck that I manage to pull off a decent combo. Sometimes the controls can cause you to get hit as well. When I first started the game I would try combo attacking only to have Ameratsu swing once and not swing again because for some odd reason theres a pause between waggles. You're supposed to swing in a rhymic fasion, but it still reads my motions by luck. It got annoying fast. Eventually I gave up and started doing single swings and running until I can attack again which kind of takes the fun out of combat. If you thought the PS2 version was too easy, prepare to die and get hit alot due to the controls of combat. You will get used to it eventually, but theres still no reason why combat should have been set up like this. It makes combat so much slower and harder than it needs to be. The celestial brush moves are affected too. One of my favorite things to do when I kill an enemy in combat is slash them in half with the Powerslash which results in a demon fang often times. I would make the line for it and nothing will happen, so my enemy either recovers or just dies without leaving me a fang. I can imagine how hard its gonna be using the other brush techniquesXD I heard many people say the celestial brush works better on the wii, but I'm having the opposite situation. Maybe a wii motion plus will solve that problem?Despite the issues in combat I still absolutely love this game. The big question is, if you played the PS2 version is the wii version worth buying? Thats a tough question. I sure as hell loved it enough to buy it again for the wii, so I'll say it depends on how much you love the PS2 version. If you never played Okami at all then don't miss out on this gem. I doubt you'll play a game as original and artistically gorgeous as Okami. Its a must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

Not Much New However!","reviewText":"Batman Arkham Origins is a pretty good addition to the series. I played the whole campaign in about 14 hours, including looking around for items (not all items in this time frame). (I've since put in about 22 hours to get to around 60% completion). If there was any concern with the game going to a new developer, there's really no need to worry about that. The gameplay and setting are almost exactly like Ark. City. There are a few new villains to battle, and new aspects of challenges, etc. The map is larger than the previous games. So there's a cool new fast travel aspect, but it's not easy to unlock every area unless you have the Brady game guide. I can't even complete the one in Burnley do to a glitch in the PC version (hope it's fixed soon).Cons: It would have been great to have a new main villain as an arch nemesis, but the Joker is back again. There are others in the game, but the Joker is still the main man. He definitely has worn out his welcome in my view. I know they had to have him to lead to the first game, but he could have just showed up in the end.Although the game is called \"Origins\", there's very little real back-story revealed about anyone that we don't already know. It would have been great to see the decision point for Bruce Wayne to become Batman, but that doesn't happen. Yes, all of the characters are younger & there are a few cool bits. But there's not enough to make this a real prequel.I also found it more difficult to grapple around the map. The grapple connections are not automatically the highest points as they were in AC. It's particularly a pain when you're just trying to zip around looking for items. You can't even grapple at all at some really big buildings & you have to go clear around. Also, the setting is winter again- it would have been nice to have a sweltering summer or something different.In the end, I'd say the game is worth playing if you've liked the others. There are definitely enough new things to hold my interest. There are significant side missions & stories. I have not tried the multiplayer.I'm finding that by the third version, most games are found wanting or feel repetitive. I guess the good thing is that this game sticks to what it is instead of jumping the shark like Assassin's Creed 3/4, etc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

Fighting the Hydra right in the beginning was awesome. This game has been keeping me awake for the last 3 nights. However, there are a few things on the negative side as well. They pushed the PS2 and it shows, while the graphics are great, the game, especially the sound, shudders occasionally and it seems the voice actors stu-stu-studder. While fun, the game has a repetitive nature, so if the button mashing thing is for you, you're all set. There is some strategy involved in how to defeat the different monsters. Some people have said that the fighting system is a bit weak, however that is actually a plus for me personally. I don't want to have to remember specific button combinations to win. God of War makes it easy to beat the crap out of the enemies, even if you don't remember all the different button combinations, which is a good thing in my book. If this sounds negative, don't worry, you'll have a blast playing it. It's one of the best action games out there, better than Devil May Cry for sure.Henning Thiel","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2005"}

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.* a main character gets killed! eat your heart out FF7! Chrono Trigger did it first, and in 32 megs as well! the helplessness of the event is so powerful, even in multiple playthroughs and i know what happens, still affects me.woo. ok, i need to calm down a bit. so, Chrono Trigger was also ported to the PSone its a cheaper way of getting the game, but i HIGHLY recommend against getting that piece of crap. reason being is that yeah it has the cool animated cut scenes but the load times are plagued in this CD port, especially when entering combat, it really kills the momentum. if you're not worried about that then power to you and go for it, but to get the best experience get the SNES version, i don't know too much about the DS version so i'm assuming its a better port, as i mentioned in the beginning you can get the title on your Wii's virtual console as well, so bam! three ways of getting the game without breaking the bank! =Doverall, this game is a MUST have for any SNES collector or a MUST play, i love both this and FF6 (FF3 in the SNES), they're both unique and different yet they both brought something new to the time. Chrono Trigger is those games that you have to play, and you'll enjoy it because its encourages you to get it your all to save a world that you'll grow to care about, and the characters are so developed even the game add a gray character, an anti-hero, with the most epic battle theme music ever! what are you waiting for?! get this game! now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2013"}

They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, &#34;hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?&#34;The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to &#34;Sell-Sell!-SELL!!&#34; instead of posting this...Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with &#34;fighting piracy&#34;. All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games &#34;protected&#34; by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly &#34;protected&#34; by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further.

I really like this game (been playing all weekend) Fct 2: The ridiculous registration scheme is pure torture.When I bought the game, it came on 5 CDs with a little instruction sheet full of misleading information. You will have to install a program called \"Steam\" which will then allow you to register Half-Life 2 online - THIS IS MANDATORY, THE UNREGISTERED GAME WILL NOT WORK!!By the way, you have to first find the CD key, pick it out from all the other text that is printed near it then remember to register with steam correctly the first time...OR ELSE YOU ARE SCROOMED (Scr#@ed and Doomed at the same time). But don't worry, if you lock up the game you can always get a replacement CD key in 6 TO 8 WEEKS!

The bad news is that you better get used to this nonsense. The rumor is that other valve games like Half-Life 3 will be DOWNLOAD ONLY (Oh goodie!).

Bridge Commander + Starfleet Command were the closest. This game worked for me because it felt like I was replaying a fleet battle from the TV series- where I can enjoy the tactical elements and the spectacular 3D ship-to-ship battle graphics.This game is at its best when it requires you to develop a strategy, such as splitting your fleet apart to tackle multiple things simultaneously, requiring you to use the tactical map and fleet controls.E.g. I had to locate bases that were creating drones that were poisoning the sector. So I dispatch all ships to all planets to locate all the bases. Then I pair up the ships so that one pair (the battleships) goes to each station to destroy them, while the remaining pair (cruisers) seeks out and dispatches the drones. Then eventually on the final station I consolidate the entire fleet for the final assault. Keeping fleet sizes to a maximum of 4 gives the game a light-weight command and conquer flavor but yet still gives you needed control of the helm so you can execute the satisfying kills. I find myself using the tactical display alot  to maintain awareness. Then i have to switch to ship view to make sure each ship is targeting the right enemy.Here are the negatives I found:The missions can last about 30 minutes and there are no save points in between. So if you die, you're screwed. That's not been too bad because the tactical elements let you try a different strategy the second time.The controls appear difficult at first. It took me about an hour to get used to them. But once you've mastered the fleet controls the game takes on a far more interesting dimension than a mindless slug fest.3-space control can get wacky, so your best bet is to target enemies and allow the computer to do most of the flying so you can just worry about firing the torpoedoes and phasers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2007"}

Of course soon afterward there are rumors about a Dragon Knight being spotted flying over a nearby outpost and your superior dispatches you to find out if there is any truth to the rumors.It turns out the dragon sightings are real and you will be fighting sooner than you thought. Just not on the side you thought or for who you thought....------------I usually like games that don't follow the \"norms\" of the genre and attempt to do their own thing.  Which means I am usually forgiving of rough edges and what have you as long as the game works well enough to be interesting.  This game is also well written which made it easy to ignore some of the mechanics, just so I could see what would happen next.  That was the case with this game until I came to the part, defeating damien's generals, were it was necessary to mostly deal with all the aspects of the game that can be very frustrating when taken by themselves.At this point I had done everything else that was available up to that point, so I had nothing left to mix in to keep the game play varied and interesting. So my recommendation if you play this game, is in the second half make sure that do a few side quests and then take out a general. Then maybe the game wont grind to a halt like it did for me. Other than that I recommend this game for anyone who likes a rpg with a decent story and tries to do it's own thing, mostly succeeding.Time Played:About 30 hours. I got very near the end of the main quest before I hit a brick wall.  I still recommend the game though.Graphics / Sound:Not a big deal to me. They do the job, their not going to set any benchmarks.Game play:This one is hard.  For the most part everything works. But it's easy to see where they probably had this great idea and then couldn't do it because of budget constraints or technical restrictions. One of the best examples is that in dragon form the player can only attack creatures in the air and not on the ground, but on the ground the player can attack things in the air.  I just get the feeling that everything was supposed to be a lot more fluid and that didn't happen for some reason.  Other than that there are rough edges everywhere, but there are some cool elements like being able to make your own critter from various parts you find lying around and you can also read NPC's minds to get more dialogue options and rewards.Story:This is one of those I wish I could have forced myself to finish, If only there was less generals!, because it is interesting and well written. For the most part the quests and the dialogue is not stereotypical and boring.  Some of it made me think and quite a bit of it got a chuckle out of me.

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Near-Perfect Game","reviewText":"OVERALL: This game is a must-buy by all standards.  The use of stealth and the colorful characters are just like the original and the other best for Playstation.  What are you standing there for reading this review?  Buy this game!GAMEPLAY: The enemy AI has drastically improved since the original Metal Gear Solid.  Solid Snake or the other character Raiden have to actually be sneaky and stealthy.  I like the fact that you can hide in lockers this time and the boxes actually resemble boxes.  Otocon and Rose, the two comm persons, are still as annoying as ever.  They remind me more of gnats than anything else.CONTROL: The control of these characters, Solid Snake and Raiden, is nearly perfect.  It is just sensitive enough without being touchy.  Even the use of the nice tang sword is fluid and smooth.  You can easily link combos with the sword.  Additionally, the camera angles actually go with the character, rather than bouce around wildly like Tomb Raider.SCENERY/GRAPHICS: The scenery and graphics are absolutely perfect.  The weather effects are \"real.\"  The birds actually move, and you can shoot down pidgeons.  Dinner, anyone?STORYLINE/CHARACTERS: The storyline is mature and involves the whole Y2K scare and gets into a long dissertation into genetics, literature and inheritance.  The Cyber-Ninja returns for this game as well.  This time around Revolver Ocelot doesn't participate tremendously as an active enemy.  Rather, he acts like a passive enemy, not really wanting to kick anyone's butt.  Again, the female characters are exceptionally strong and hot, especially Fortune and Olga.  We do learn that Liquid Snake is not dead.  (Like how many times do we have to kill this guy?)  A new boss (that actually looks like Big Boss) comes in, and his name is Solidus Snake.  I liked this guy for a boss.  He had honor and dignity in his conquest, unlike Liquid Snake who was -- and still is -- on a freaking power trip.  Hopefully, we get someone like Solidus Snake on the good side next time around.  Someone big and someone who prefers the use of swords!MOVIES:  Sometimes long, but well worth watching.  But you have to experience with the vibration ON!  That is absolutely critical!SOUND EFFECTS: These sound effects are nearly perfect as well.  The guns sounds like the respective guns, and the vibration effect is a nice touch.  When the enemies are patrolling and ordering a clearance, you can actually feel the heartbeats increasing.  The voiceovers are also spectacular, but the movie effects are dramatic.IMPROVEMENTS: Easier method to obtain the stealth suit, rather than playing the game over and over.  Next, I hope for a more interactive environment, and the ability to hide under desks.  Also, next time I hope that we can for example push the shelves (like Tomb Raider: Chronicles) to block during a clearance and to \"hide\" enemies.  Other than that, buy this game, will you?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2002"}

In this follow-up to the critically acclaimed first title, Jack Carver thinks he's found paradise. When a gorgeous woman draws him in on a dangerous heist, their sun drenched days take a chilling turn. Hunted for a murder he didn't commit, Jack must draw on his most savage instincts to make his predators his prey.","reviewerName":"Cobalt","summary":"A content-stuffed, enjoyable alternate to the PC version.","reviewText":"Just to clear up confusion, this title is actually a graphically upgraded combination of two separate games that previously came out for the original Xbox: \"Far Cry Instincts\" and \"Far Cry Instincts: Evolution.\"  Both of those titles were created in response to the first official Far Cry being PC-only, so that console gamers could have a similar experience.  Both of them have been combined here onto one disc under the title \"Far Cry Instincts: Predator,\" and for someone who has never played the previous two games, this is obviously the best option.  The downside is that the FCI camapign must be completed first before the Evolution campaign can be unlocked.  However, it offers loads of fun content, and is well worth the money spent.FCIP is not a direct port of the original PC-exclusive version.  Rather, it is more of a re-imagining, with some elements that have been changed, added, or excluded, but the overall feel of the original is still there.  For instance, rather than having a blade take up one weapon slot in the original, FCIP has a permanent blade that you can use at any time to perform stealth kills and melee attacks with, which frees you up to experiment with better weapons.  Also, in contrast to the MP5 being the only suppressed weapon in the original, FCIP has suppressed pistols and sniper rifles for short and long range respectively.  Finally, unlike the original, FCIP allows you to dual-wield many weapons, which definitely helps for providing extended firepower during intense, tight firefights.  Sadly, though, FCIP is more linear than the original, and the overall quality of FCIP's graphics doesn't quite measure up to the original's vast, clear draw distances.The biggest difference, however, is FCIP's introduction of feral powers.  Early on in the game, you actually get injected with the mutagen serum that Dr. Krieger was testing on the Trigens, and you acquire a whole mess of animalistic powers, ranging from an instant-kill melee attack, to running extremely fast, jumping massive distances, tracking enemies using their scent, and even regenerating health.  It's by far the one feature that elevates FCIP far above the original.  It honestly never gets old running and jumping through the environments at blinding speeds, tracking enemies and then sending them flying with one massive punch.  It almost makes using normal weapons completely obsolete.  You have an adrenaline meter that decreases every time you use an ability.  It regenerates over time, but you can gain boosts by eating MRIs, killing enemies, or taking damage.  This combination of normal and supernatural abilities is extremely similar to the original Xbox game \"Breakdown,\" and the mechanics work pretty much the same way.The hardest difficulty in FCIP is much easier overall than the original, mostly thanks to your feral ability to regenerate health.  However, for the first three levels of the game, you're a completely normal person, so stealth is obviously much more valuable.  To this end, you're able to perform silent kills with your knife, throw rocks to distract enemies, crouch and go prone to hide in the dense vegetation, rig whipping tree branch traps, and use suppressed weapons.  The only way to acquire health and added protection during this time is to find and pick up medkits and bulletproof vests, which can be in pretty short supply.  There's also many vehicles you can drive to travel much faster and avoid unnecessary combat.  At the start of the fourth level, from then on, things only become easier.  It's too bad the original PC version didn't incorporate this element, as that would've been the icing on the cake of an already amazing game.  There's one catch, however: you don't gain all the feral abilities at once.  They're slowly given to you as you progress further through the game.  This means that you still have to be sneaky and strategic to avoid being overpowered.  It adds a nicely scaled challenge without making the game too easy.The graphics of FCIP, like I said earlier, have been improved from the original Xbox versions, but don't quite match the overall quality of the PC version.  Still, FCIP boasts a large number of diverse environments, from bright sandy beaches, to thick overgrown jungles, to underground research labs and even inside a glowing volcano.  The physics still have the same level of high interactivity that the PC version had, the best part of which is sending mercenaries flying and flipping through the air with your powerful feral punch.  The voice acting is actually better than the PC version and doesn't sound quite as detached or cheesy.  Also, the environmental ambience is perfect, from the water breaking against the beach, to the leaves rustling in the jungle, to various animal noises all around.The \"Evolution\" part of FCIP is basically just an expansion pack, as it plays exactly the same as FCI, complete with all your feral powers from the part, and doesn't last nearly as long.  The only difference is that the graphics are slightly better, and the levels feel more open-ended overall.  However, this time, you face warriors that have the same feral powers as you, which levels the playing field and makes battles tougher and more strategic than fighting normal mercenaries.Overall, I have to say that I still prefer the original Far Cry on PC over FCIP.  However, FCIP is a hugely enjoyable title with basically two separate games in one package.  It stays true to the spirit and inspiration of the PC version, but at the same time sports enough unique differences about it to make it worth the time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"A novel a day\"","summary":"Solid game.  COULD have been revolutionary.","reviewText":"It's now been almost two weeks since BF3 has been released.  And after playing the campaign 1.5 times and logging in about 24 hours worth of MP, I feel that I can give a rather honest assessment of the overall game.SP:The fact that the campaign has such gloriously awe-inducing high spots makes its overall failure that much more bitter.  It's been noted that the SP is downright dull.  I have to agree with this, generally speaking.  It's like, there is a great 2 hour campaign in there with 2-3 hours of filler.  Telling the story via flashbacks from an interrogation just feels too... unoriginal.  The story could have moved at a great pace had we actually been in the action in the present.  Instead, you know you're going to live, and you have to put up with these two d-bags that are hounding you for information in the form of Good Cop/Bad Cop.  There are lots of unanswered questions.I played the campaign on Normal mode for my first go through, and I actually died far more than I anticipated.  Often, stray bullets that seemingly came out of nowhere would kill me.  Or, my favorite, I would be hiding behind cover, look over and shoot a couple times, and then duck back under the cover and crawl to another side of the cover, only to be shot immediately upon poking my head out.  So, there is no split second where they don't know where I am.  Also, your brothers in arms don't seem to draw much fire.  It's like the enemy is solely out for you.The .5 in the \"playing the campaign 1.5 times,\" was played on Hard.  I wouldn't even suggest bothering to play it on hard.  This mode is full of what I consider cheap death upon cheap death.  Dying before you can even react, having to army crawl through entire areas--which, while possibly realistic, is terribly boring--and having every enemy seemingly snipe you from across the map, all of these things lend to the overall feeling of not really being challenged...  Basically, the Hard difficulty isn't more challenging or requires additional skill... it just requires you to sit patiently behind cover and poke your head out to pop off two shots, and in the process get immediately shot until you either die or are quick enough to go back to hiding.  Not the best, in my opinion.There are many high points to the SP.  The paratrooper mission is great.MP:  Lots of issues.  Could be great.  In as few of words as possible: bad hit detection, I am NOT the type to whine about something like this frequently, but I genuinely feel that it is an issue in this game, either that or it takes far too many bullets to kill your enemy; a process I can only describe as being able to sink into walls/floors when you are prone, thus making the enemy only have a partial target (which is incredibly cheap); creating a squad of friends does not always work, sometimes you'll end up on separate squads or even opposing teams when the game starts; the weapons are fantastic and feel weighty-which is great; driving vehicles is not super easy, and I absolutely appreciate that; the maps are beautifully rendered.The maps:  Oh, the maps, how you are a bittersweet mistress.  I cannot help but feel that many of the large maps needed to be scaled down quite a bit to be truly enjoyed.  It is not a lie when people say that you can go 10 minutes without seeing anyone, sans someone flying overhead in a jet, in some of the largest maps.  It's not really an issue, but it does detract from gameplay when you can't find anything at all to do.  That being said, I love many of the maps and find them balanced.  There are small maps with intense ground forces combat, and there are maps where using the vehicles is mandatory for victory.Lastly:  I know that it seems like I have listed a lot of negative things, and I suppose I have, but many of these things could be remedied.A great game and a great community.  Especially after the team deathmatch crowd leaves for MW3.EDIT: 11/8/11: The lag appears to have disappeared almost completely.

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Castle \"Oregon writer\"","summary":"A family-friendly masterpiece starring Atlas and P-body!","reviewText":"What a wonderful weekend adventure for our sons (ages 8 and 7) as they successfully completed Portal 2 in co-op mode. Of course, they needed a three-day weekend to complete all five courses but boy was it fun for the whole family.Any concerns about replay value were quelled by the unique storyline (and depth) provided for co-op play. Xbox 360 games rated 'Everyone 10+' are difficult enough to find but one that offers 'couch co-op' play with this much depth for younger players is extremely rare.With their parents rooting them on through every level, our two young boys assumed the characters of Atlas and P-body, the robotic heroes. Of course, every great adventure needs an antagonist, thus GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System), the sarcastic sentient computer system returns, too.Depending on whom you ask, GLaDOS favors P-body a.k.a Orange over Atlas a.k.a Blue. It was a hoot to hear GLaDOS (voiced again by Ellen McLain) praise one robot (son) and watch his brother weigh the comment. Claims of innocence were as common as statements like, \"I don't know what she's talking about.\"The boys ultimately discovered the guide's misdirection. Here's a sample of the funnier (and more biting) comments from GLaDOS:* \"I don't want to drive a wedge between the two of you, but I've been studying Blue's performance, and I don't know how to put this... I'm certain you're trying very hard.\"* \"I can't keep quiet about this. I think Orange is actively trying to sabotage your success. Let's keep this between us.\"* \"Blue, Orange and I were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests.\"* \"Yes Orange, Blue did act like a fool just now.\"* \"Blue, please disregard the following statement: Orange, you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence.\"* \"I've been doing some reading. Did you know that the word orange is derived from the same Latin root as the word traitor?\"Atlas and P-body are the game's main charm. A silly pair who brings to memory the humor of famous comedy teams like Laurel and Hardy, and Abbott and Costello.In summary, I encourage parents with young children to pick up this family-friendly game. There's no blood. There's no sex. There's no adult language. The puzzles require teamwork and physics but no individual challenge was so difficult that our sons didn't figure it out. And their sense of accomplishment grew with each, more difficult level.Rating: Five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FPM3HS","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great potential, but nearly everything is broken and severely flawed","reviewText":"The Good: Creepy atmosphere, disturbing scenes and imagesThe Bad: Story makes zero sense, horrible unresponsive and cumbersome combat, constant backtracking, no sense of direction, inventory is always getting cluttered, lame hidden items and extrasThis is a very hard game to review. I wanted to like this game so bad and it had so much potential. The beginning cut scene is disturbing and the excellent and eerie soundtrack playing out is fantastic. It starts out like a Silent Hill game with the gritty film grain, and the dark atmosphere. I honestly can't tell you what the story is about because it is never explained at all, even at the very end I didn't know who the bad guy was, why I was doing all this, and who was what. I can tell you that you get dumped off at an orphanage via bus with your little brother Joshua. You walk up to the creepy orphanage and you immediately know something's not right. Kids with paper bags over their heads are beating something bloody in a canvas sack. You sneak around to the back and after a few cut scenes you realize you're running errands for this creepy child occult, but the purpose is never explained.Once you start playing for a while you will notice many of this game's flaws. There's no map and no sense of directions. You will got lost and not know where the hell to go through the whole game. Most of the game you are wandering from room to room looking for items for your dog Brown to find. He will sniff these items out and find the next item for you and you just follow him. If it wasn't for this the entire game would be broken exploration wise. Like Silent Hill there are many secrets in the game, but you won't care about these. The airship that you wander around in is so big and confusing. Each room and hallway looks the same and you can't tell where you are ever going even if you memorize it. Some parts become familiar because you go through them over 50 times during the game. I also didn't even know why I was on an airship! Nothing made a lick of sense through the whole game.Let's start with combat, it sucks big time. Holding R1 will put you in ready mode and X swings. This would be great if you moved more than a centimeter so you can go in for a kill. Enemies will knock you down and you will go through a long and grueling recovery animation only to get knocked over again. There are very few healing items around unless you have Brown sniff out items like ribbons and socks to bring to the Aristocrat Club to be exchanged for healing items. What's the Aristocrat Club? I have no idea, but it's just there. There are 3 boss fights in the entire game and they are annoying because the combat is slow, sluggish, and cumbersome in this game. I can't express it enough. If that's not bad enough, running around trying to find all these damn items will give you a headache. After you find them you just drop them because they are no longer needed. Your inventory is constantly cluttered up with useless crap that you just end up dropping. Why have this mechanic?!The game itself is very short running about 7-8 hours if you follow a walkthrough step by step. If not, you probably won't even finish this game. It felt generally tolerable to me because I used a walkthrough through the whole thing, but if you don't, I doubt you could even finish the game. I also have to comment on the controversy surrounding the game, there's nothing all that bad in here. There were claims of the girls being molested in cut scenes, but the worst I saw was an old guy rubbing a girl's head and her arms a lot. There are no rape scenes, nothing even sexually provocative. The game is very bloody and down right sick and twisted, but nothing on the other spectrum.Apart from that, the game had a lot of potential. The atmosphere is there and it's pretty scary at times and very disturbing, I just wish I knew what the hell was going on. The story is completely convoluted and doesn't go anywhere, you can't make a single bit of sense of it. The combat is atrocious and the lack of direction and the constant backtracking will make 99% of players quit early on. I really wanted to love this game, but as I got through each hour the score kept dropping in the my head and the reasons why were piling up. If you are really curious I would pick it up as a low bargain bin price, but nothing more. If a fried has a copy, borrow it because it is a strange experience and worth talking about with friends.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

Then we got sick of it, and I just assumed that I didnt like Assassin's Creed and all that jazz. Well Then I started hearing about how awesome the series had gotten, and so I saw the 2nd and 3rd one for like $5 each on Amazon during some crazy sale. So I picked them both up, and I just figured that I'd go onto Youtube and watch a recap of the story of the first one since that was the one I remembered not liking. But after seeing the recap of the story, and realizing how good a story this game had, I decided I wanted to know all the details that get left out in the youtube quick vids. Man I'm glad I bought this game for the PC. First off the graphics are real nice, which is a plus. My issue with this game is not as for what you can do, but rather how its all set up through the controls. I'm not sure about the others in the others in the series, since I am currently on this one, but my only real complaint about the game are the controls. So if they fix the controls in the future ones, then I'll be glued to the Assassins Creed series. My advice is to give this game a chance, because it has a really great story. And if you played this game before and didnt like it like myself, but are here thinking about it again. My advice to you is to look at the game from a story perspective, rather then a gameplay perspective. Because when I went into this game originally, I tried to treat it like an open world sandbox kind of game. And this just isnt that sort of game where you'll have loads of fun doing that. It's instead more of a linear game, that takes place in a giant open world. Thats why I started to dislike the game, was because I felt it was lacking in the open world \"Things to do\" department, not realizing thats not what the game was intended to be played as. It's a very story driven game, and it has a hell of a great story. Like I said the story I saw on youtubes recap of the game was so good, I had to play through the game for myself. So check it out if your still reading this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits.

Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

The number of indiviual powers are drasticlly reduced: stone, fire, needle, bomb, ice, cutter, and spark, but the game allows you to combine 2, whih is necessary to access some crystals, and provide you with around 27 powers (you can have dual of the same power to get a bigger of that one, like on 2x needle you get bigger reach of needles). Controlls are simple enough, like all the kirby games are, so you can focus on the game.

Single-player...Bungie didn't even bother trying","reviewText":"Halo 3...I have trouble knowing where it is I'm supposed to begin with this game other than to say it is the greatest let-down of my gaming \"career.\"  Now, to start off I am in no way a Halo hater.  In fact I have been a fan ever since the original game was released on the PC (I have since acquired a Xbox 360 and the original Xbox version of that game and its sequel).  In fact I was so excited by the hype of the third game that I went ahead and pre-ordered the $150 Legendary Edition of the game.  The result of when I finally got the game was that never again do I ever plan to pre-order a game or pay top-dollar for a \"Collector's\" edition of a game- unless it's in a bargain bin a year or two later (In fact that did happen to the Halo 3 Legendary Edition- saw it for $60 somewhere and shall never forgive myself for my wasted $150).Let me break this game down a bit.Graphics:  They're good I suppose, but didn't Microsoft promise us that this game was practically the reason the 360 was created?  This game's graphics are nothing special in this day and age.  While the first one was good for its time and the second was great for its time of release this game's graphics wouldn't rank in the `Top 10' list of Best 360 Game Graphics- not by a long shot.  Often it feels rushed, as if Microsoft pushed Bungie into finishing this sequel as fast as humanly possible.Character designs: The new character designs also are pretty bad.  For starters, all characters seem to have taken steroid injections because whether it's the Elites or humans, they have all seriously bulked up.  They've also become shorter and just seem very awkward in comparison to the designs of the first two games.  I just was not convinced that many of the Covenant species were even capable of walking in this game.Look:  The entire game seems to have been put through a shiny filter that makes everything reflect colors at the same rate as a mirror- even plant life.  Wasn't this game supposed to be the most realistic Halo yet?  I remember Bungie officials and various magazine articles telling me that, but when was the last time YOU walked into a forest and it shined at you?  You could say this is water, but unless there is a thin layer of water coating each and every leaf (which is unbelievable in of itself) than everything seems to be polished.  Now, this isn't just the forest, but EVERY character and EVERY LOCATION of this entire game.  Weapons, characters, plants, shields, ships, and buildings- everything shines like well-polished silver.Story:  This plot of Halo 3 is so simple I'm sure the officials at Bungie must have spent 5 minutes on it.  Looking back on it I know that Halo 2 suffered in this department as well, but Halo 3 you instantly take note of how poor the story is.  The cut scenes were probably the best parts of both the previous games, but here they become exercises in repetition and clich&eacute;.  Everything is overblown and none of it is ever believable.  They try often to make these scenes dramatic, but apparently whoever had a sense of drama in the previous games cut scenes left the project because this game's cut scenes are about as subtle as a sledgehammer.Levels:  Many of the levels are nothing new other than the fact you now have more weapons in which to deal with your pesky foes.  No new forms of enemies to face, nothing really of interest.AI:  Every entry in the Halo game series suffers from heavily script-based AI, but this game's AI is so simpleminded that once you've played through the game once on any of the difficulties you'll know exactly how to get through it on any other difficulty setting.  I swear, if you play this game on Easy and then play on Legendary, aside from the fact that enemies have higher hit points, they will respond to you the exact same way as they do on the other settings and they will never surprise you.  Come on, Bungie- over ten years ago with Half-Life Valve proved that you could write AI that was capable of creating its own strategy.  This is another example in my observation that this game was solely made for the multiplayer aspect and they didn't care about the single-player campaign.Weapons:  Much of this is the same, but we add in the most annoying aspect of this game, and that would be the power-ups.  What were they thinking when they put these in campaign mode?  I could understand silly power-ups being in, say, the multiplayer, but how do they fit into the actual game?  They are worthless addition and it shows that Bungie rushed this game because they obviously belong in the multiplayer and not the actual game mode.Multiplayer:  I suppose this is the only good part about this game, but it feels like a simple-minded retread of other multiplayer games such as Unreal Tournament.Legendary Edition: Aside from the collectible bust of the Master Chief's head this is probably the most overprice item I've ever purchased.  There is nothing really special about it, and the special features contained within the DVDs don't really give you much insight into the creation of the games.  You get things like the cut scenes from the first two games, which is kind of cool, but honestly those scenes feel very hollow unless you're actually playing the game.So all and all Halo 3 is an alright multi-player game, but the story is awful, the graphics are sub-par considering we've seen such games as Half-Life2, `Gears of War', and `Call of Duty 4' display far superior improvements in the field.  All and all the game is a rushed product that doesn't have any of the quality control that was displayed in the previous games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"Perfect Dark is the best First Person Shooter EVER!","reviewText":"And this, Snowboard Kids 2, Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye 007, Wave Race 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Pokemon Stadium and Mario 64 (even though I've overplayed the latter three) are worth owning a N64 again for. Even if you have to buy it used from somewhere.Let me start off by saying that this game is so fun. And I mean it's exceedingly fun. Even alone. You play as a character named Joanna Dark. The one-player mode, although I've only played it once since I re-bought the game, is pretty solid. You have a few select objectives to pull off on each and every mission. It gets harder as you go along. The music is solid and memorable, but the graphics aren't great. They're slightly above average at best for the N64.But the game shines in its Combat Simulator mode. It is a mode where you make your way through over 25 missions, completing random objectives from Uploading a terminal with a Data Uplink, to King Of The Hill (which pits you against one or more \"bots\" to take on a challenge that has you having to stay in a certain spot for 20 or so seconds, claiming that it's yours. If you do so, while the enemy stays away, you get the point, and move on to the next \"Hill\") to my favorite, Capture the case. Capture the case is a mission where you must go to your opponent's hideout and get their little case, bring it back to your hideout, and make it back to your own case. However, if the enemy has already made it to your case before you get back, you must chase them down, which is hella fun, in order for your case to return to its original spot. There are more missions such as just killing your opponent 10 times or holding onto a briefcase for as long as you can.Lastly, I'm going to list all the weapons, which are mostly guns, in the game. I'll also list my top 5 favorites and explain their functions.FalconMag-SecMaulerPhoenixDY357 MagnumDY357-LX Magnum (gold)CMP150CycloneCallistoRC-P120 (don't have this gun yet, don't remember it either)Laptop GunDragonK7 AvengerAR34S-Dragon (don't have or remember this one either)Sniper RifleReaperFarsightShotgunDevastatorRocket LauncherCrossbowSlayer#1 Slayer - launches missles just like a regular rocket launcher. However, it has a twist. Although you must stand totally still while using its Fly-By-Wire feature, you get to actually follow the bullet as you search for someone to kill!! Talk about innovative! Go, RARE!#2 Laptop Gun - An extraordinary gun that performs fast shooting bullets in its normal use. However, if you throw it on the ground or onto a random wall, the next time someone comes within its sight, they get shot at. It will use all its bullets if it must!#3 Dragon - Acts as an ordinary gun that shoots speedy bullets on its initial function, comes alive as a grenade launcher on its second.#4 Cyclone - One bad as hell gun. It's very, VERY fast, and its second function lets you empty out 50 bullets, one right after the other at a blazing speed, ensuring a better chance at killing a weary opponent.#5 AR34 - A fast gun, but when compared to some of my other favorites, it just doesn't measure up. Has a very close-up scope function.Worst. Gun. Ever.Reaper.Pros:*Graphics are manageable, but nothing special.*Sound is pretty cool. It has a decent range of types of music.*Lots of missions to keep a single player busy, while not around friends.*Decent realism when you get killed, falling to the ground. Maybe a bit slow, but decent nonetheless.*Up to 4 players, which is pure pandemonium!*Different personalities for bots keep the gameplay interesting.Cons:*Starts off pitifully easy, gets painfully impossible somewhat towards the end. Some missions come down to luck, when you're actually revived after a death near a helpful weapon.*Graphics aren't anything to scream about.*AI is extremely cheap on some missions where there are expert bots.*At some point, for about 90% of the people who play this, your blood will be boiling at how impossible this game can really seem.Overall, this is the best First Person Shooter that I've ever played (think Goldeneye 007, and then improve it in almost every way), and one of the best and most complete experiences I've ever had. The only real letdown is the insane AI as you move on.This game has kept me sane on days where I'm usually bored.While not perfect, it has very few shortcomings so I'm giving it a perfect 5. I hope you enjoy it at least half as much as I did, for that will surely be saying something!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2007"}

After playing Fallout and Oblivion (and liking them) I was ready for something with a more classic RPG/SRPG feel to it. The good thing about this game was definitely the graphics. This game is just astonishingly beautiful. I mean it is just breathtaking what they did with this game. Also, the general idea of the gameplay was pretty great as well. I like SRPGs and this take on them was really good I thought. There was a lot of minute strategy to the game which i really appreciated.The most annoying thing for me though was the story. When I play an RPG of anytype, I expect a great story. This story just had nothing special to it. The characters had development which was a plus, but I fealt like the game was treating me like a manic depressive and they were patting me on the back the whole time. It had a very \"Oh things are bad but everything will be OK! ~follow with a quirky grin\" feel to it. It's ok at first but mission after mission with relatively nothing interesting happening was too much for me. I put it down after about 10-12 chapters. I didn't like the fact that I had to watch 5-6 cutscenes, maybe more, to play a mission. The loading times were RIDICULOUS..For a 30 second cutscene I would have to sit through a 1-2 minute loading screen.I mentioned earlier that the general idea of the gameplay was great. However, when you get into the details, this game just fails. When I shoot someone, I don't care how strong they are, it should at least hurt. A lot of times you find yourself unloading on someone and it takes a tenth of their health away. If you throw a grenade at someone, it will kill them, which makes sense. But if you throw a grenade at someone that is laying down in grass, it can land on their head and blow up and it will only marginally hurt them (WTF?). The AI in this game is ridiculous. Your enemies will basically run around in circles with absolutely no strategy until you get close enough to them to shoot. Final Fantasy Tactics on the PS1 had better AI. Some of the levels were ridiculously hard to get an A-rank in and some were a piece of cake with little to no effort.The characters, well that was a wash IMO. The supporting-main characters I thought were really good. The more mature ones I thought fit their role really well. But the main characters I thought were just...well..lackluster. Like I said, the main character was a perpetual pat-on-the-back which got annoying after a while.All in all, this game was ok and I wish I could have finished it. But after several missions, with really nothing new presented as far as story or anything else, it just became too much.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2009"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"A.

Never used it cause the games are just not worth using the terrible torture controls that are allowed on a PS. Anywho, I read the reviews and thought I would try it. Wow, this game is more than a game, it is a moving, frustrating, emotional, immersive, gripping, loving and brutal story. I like the voice acting and the graphics are darn good for a PS3. I am a PC snob with a powerhouse pc that has amazing graphics. SO that is another reason not to play PS3. But, this is worth buying a ps3 just to play, IMO. Hope you can get into it as much as me. Very hard to learn to use the controls after decades of mouse and pc keyboard. Still tough, but again, the game and story is worth it.Follow up:This game is so short, I had to take off a star.

shooter.The later titles I was very disappointed with and felt they were \"Dumbed\" down.This review is my initial impressions and subject to change as I do in most of my reviews.Pros:1)Graphics were well done IMHO everything seemed to be going smooth.2)Sound is excellent I have a lot of hearing loss and had no problems hearing the game.Even with a intercooler running.3)Weapons were well rendered and the ability to customize is fun.I do gunsmith work on the side and can say some of the mods were impractical but it's a game.They all had their own distinct sound.I recommend choosing random for your weapon as I could spend hours changing parts.I would have liked a jam or 2 thrown in for a touch of uh oh.4)Voice acting is good so far with the usual wisecracks and such as troops tend to do.5)Some of the future tech is very cool I enjoy sneaking around with the cloak and the UAV is fun to use.6)I enjoyed doing sync shots and the fire fights could get intense on Elite.7)The controls were easy to learn not much of a learning curve.The Tutorials are make it easy to learn the game.8)I like the challenges to unlock weapons and gear which make it worth going back to redux missions.9)The hand to hand kills are a nice touch to the game.Cons so far:1)I find the maps a little to restrictive and not enough room to maneuver.2)I have found the enemy AI to be very easy even on elite.Friendly AI seems decent so far subject to change.3)I found I needed to get used to the camera angles.4)The cover system seemed not to work well.As I play and get used to it I might change my mind.My thoughts:I approached this game with a open mind and find I am enjoying it.I like the sci-fi aspects of it.As I have only played the first 2 missions I will not comment on the campaign length or the story.Ubi-soft did a good job on the tutorials and there is not a big learning curve.I did find enemy AI a bit dumb but as I play I might change my mind on the AI of the game.The ability to customize weapons and load out for missions make this better than other shooters.I feel this game has a good cross of COD/BF and OFP.Players will need to think and you can flank enemies instead of shooting it out with them.I would have like free roam like OFP DR as I felt the maps were to small not as bad as BF or COD.That is my opinion,I attempted to play like COD and found you would go down quick.I did find the stealth missions to be to easy IMO.This might change as I play.All in all I'm having fun with this game and have no regrets yet.I only hope the campaign is of good length as I feel that is lacking in many games today.I have very poor internet in my area so I cannot do a review of online content.Please accept my apology on that aspect.I will update this review as I play more and can't wait to get out of work to play.Stay tuned for updates.Update 5-24-12After playing more I'm really liking this game.I love using the UAV to scout ahead and mark targets for sync shots.The only habit I need to break is to not sit back during fire fights and just mark targets for my squad.I managed to not fire a shot during one engagement.I agree with other reviewers on the cut scenes not looking as good as game play.To me that is minor and not worth trashing the game over.I also like that you do not get endless waves of enemies like other games once you secure a area it is secure.I do have a few gripes.1)I do not like the lack of control when you go into diamond formation during a rescue.It seemed to me it was on rails and I really could not move or take cover.2)Lack of control for your AI teammates I do not know why that is not on this game.It would have been fun to issue basic move orders.I would have liked the ability to use formations such as wedge, line etc.All I can do so far is mark targets to focus fire on.The AI will move on it's own.On a positive note your teammates do not get in the way of your fire and are good at reviving you if you get shot.I like trying to do the challenges during the mission to unlock weapons.I do find the missions to be short but that might change as I progress.I am getting used to the cover system as I play.Update 5-25-12I'm finding as you progress you unlock more gear NVGs a UGV which kicks serious butt.So far the story is progressing along with a semi-predictable plot.I'm sure there will be a twist somewhere along the line.The missions are starting to get a little more tactical and challenging.There is also a mission where you get to be a gunner from a Helo like GR AW2.Players can also issue orders to heal a squadmate.I consider the campaign to be far superior to MW3 or BF3.I only wish I had better service to try it online.I recommend trying to complete the challenges as it is worth it to unlock better weapons and parts.So far I have found no glitches and framerates are smooth on my PS3 Fat.5-29-12Final thoughts I give this game 4 stars overall.I enjoyed the campaign and the challenges will keep players going back to complete them.It took me around 16 hrs to complete this game on elite.I felt it was to short hence why I gave it 4 stars.I did find as you progress the missions got more challenging and I had to think and not charge in.Gamers of all levels should enjoy this game it is simple to learn and well done.As a Ghost Recon \"Purist\" I could have nit picked this game.I chose to approach it with a open mind and I'm glad I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

Not too bad, since we all knew that the netcode was broken. I'm also playing on the PlayStation 3 because I prefer to play online games on there. That, or the PC. I picked this up for the PlayStation 3 because on the PC, it's linked to Steam and I figured if it sucked, I could sell this on Amazon or Craigslist. The game has hardly any load time. It's probably the fastest title I've seen in a while as far as loading times. It asked me to sign in to the PlayStation Network. I chuckled a bit, and then moved on.The first screen that appears is one asking you to create a character. The creation tools are really cool, and giving yourself scars or tattoos make permanent marks on your skin. Don't like it? You can just create another character!The game has a few gameplay options. I tried out a few of the challenges (which don't work fully due to the PSN being down). They're alright. Then I tried Single Player. I knew what I was getting into: multiplayer training in single player. I had heard the bots were dumb. Boy, that's the understatement of the year. These bots will literally stand right next to the objectives or near enemies, and do nothing. It's embarrassing.I played for about an hour. I can say the multiplayer might be fun, if it works when the PSN is up, but for now, I can't think of one thing gameplay wise this game is doing that's worthy of a $60 price tag. The graphics are sucky too. If you've played an Unreal Tournament 3 engine title, you know where the textures have to load in? Yeah, this game constantly does this. It's very, very annoying. And the one thing I was interested in, the Mirror's Edge style gameplay, is useless. It's just tragic. Bulletstorm has more parkour than this game. Just sad...I usually give games a second go. When the PSN is back up, I'll try it out and then I'll review the entire title after patches and such. I'm hoping that this game doesn't die off completely. I think there's a lot of potential if the online community stays with it.Also, if you want an easy Platinum Trophy, or 100% achievement, this game is for you. After 1 hour, I was at 30% complete. I'll be at 100% within a week, I'm sure. NOTHING is hard, even if it seems hard.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00140P9G0","reviewerName":"B.L.","summary":"Fantastic","reviewText":"Portal is one of those games that shows that game design can both be the creation of a form of entertainment, and a work of art as well. If you actually look at everything that's happening around your character and listen to the things GladOS says, the developers did a really remarkable job of making the nature of the situation something that subtly creeps up on you rather than just dumping it into your lap. A fair bit of what's happening is just implied (and it's a great example of the \"show, don't tell\" model of good writing).You can have fun with it just playing it on the level of a series of challenges to get through. The game does a very good job of supplying you with all of the mental tools that you need to beat the levels. The difficulty builds as you move through in a way that takes advantages of things you've already had to figure out how to achieve, and there are little 'warning' panels around that can be something of a hint of what you're going to need to do to get past an area.The mechanics of the portal gun challenge you to think about the geometry of the space you're in very differently than you normally do. The base game is tough in places but not overwhelmingly difficult (with a bit of coaching and occasional help I managed to get a 9 year old through it, he completely missed the subtle story points but he loved the humor and the puzzles). There are also special challenge versions of the levels that unlock at the end and demand that you work a lot harder to make it through, just in case you want to push your limits a little more.The core of the game is not very long, but downloadable versions can be bought very very cheaply these days if you keep an eye on the Internet for a good deal to pop up.Portal is a great example of the potential of games as a storytelling and artistic medium, in addition to being just plain entertaining.Tip:If you want to be able to play using an xbox 360 controller on a PC, btw, you go into the game and hit the ` key to bring up the development console. Then you have to use two commands:exec 360controllercrosshair 1(For more information, look at the Steam help page titled \"Using an XBox 360 Controller with Source Games\") Then you can close the window and go on with playing. If you only use the first of those two commands, the crosshair goes away and you don't have a visual indicator of where your shots will land. When you do this, you still get prompts about how to play that will indicate that you should be hitting keyboard buttons, but you can do all the things you need in order to beat levels without messing with the keyboard and mouse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2012"}

As I played Portal, it gave me the sense of being placed in this kind of deadly situation just as the Bionic Woman was in. Portal is a very cool gaming experience, and once you figure out what you can do to advance through the game while creating portals, you will feel really smart and good about yourself.  A brilliantly funny head trip that is short and sweet.  When Valve finally come out with Half Life 2 episode 3, I hope that they surprise me by incorporating the portal gun along with the gravity gun.  I can't imagine what kind of creative mayhem I could get away with by using both technology together, but I can imagine that it would be fun.  Which is what games are meant to be.... fun.  Just as Portal is.  Kudos to the team that put this one together.  Well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2010"}

But when it comes down to it I am glad I took a leap of faith and bought it! This origin story is masterfully written and the graphics are pretty good too! It has a very Uncharted/ Indiana Jones feel to it, as most Tomb Raiders have, but this is much more than that. The action commands that prompt you to press a button sequence or do something in the midst of a cinematic or during fast paced gameplay are excellent and should be in every game. It adds just a little more to the experience. I won't give away the ending but the story is fairly decent, the ending could use some work but I am not complaining! This game sets the way for a brand new kind of Tomb Raider and I hope they keep at it! Buy this if you want a good action adventure game, its relatively cheap (free on PS Plus this month) and will definitely be worth your time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Sorry Ninja Theory","reviewText":"I am one those people who was upset upon seeing this game's first trailer. I like Ninja Theory and their game Heavenly Sword, but I was not impressed by the way they changed Dante. Because of that and because Capcom has cheated me in the past, I didn't buy on day one. But now that the price has dropped I have gone through it and this is what I feel.*************************PROS************************************-Story: This is the strongest point. I know most fans don't care but I have always wanted a good story in DMC game. I have to say while I really want Capcom to finish the original DMC story, this DMC has the best story and story telling so far. Just loved it. I would give this game a five star just for its story and the action.-Heck&Slash; Action: DMC3 is still the king when it comes to Heck&Slash; action, but the action in this game is not bad either. I loved the wide variety of combos you can perform with Angel and Demon weapons. It is also easy to switch between the weapons so no complains here.-Characters: This is where Ninja Theory shines. They are really good at designing and giving life to characters. This is why I loved Heavenly Sword and was able to tolerate Enslaved. This studio is really good at making unique characters with memorable persona. Bravo Ninja Theory.-Moves video tutorial: I am happy they decided to keep this feature (basically short videos showing each moves). It is important for average player such as myself so I know if I am pulling out a move correctly or not.-Weapons: Again loved the combination of Angels and Demon weapons, but again DMC3 is still the king and Pandora's box in DMC4 is still the best weapon.-Certain enemies and Bosses: I didn't like design of many enemies and bosses but certain enemies and bosses are well designed and well drawn. I enjoyed some boss fights (no spoilers).-Limbo art/concept: Really liked the concept of the Limbo world. While graphically this game is not the best, it still looks pretty good.-Platforming: Limbo worlds and use of weapons also makes platforming a great feature in this game. To best to my knowledge this is the first DMC where I enjoyed to the platforming.-Upgrades: Upgradable weapons, skills and character adds RPG element to this game like previous DMCs. Great.Replayability: I replayed each and every previous DMC because I liked Heck&Slash; gameplay, different difficulties and 100% upgrade completion. Same is true for this one.*************************CONS************************************-A step backward: So sad that this game runs at lower fps and has poorer graphics than DMC4. Don't see why they would do that.-Virgil's downfall: Like Europeans we should have been given an option to get it free with pre-order. So ticked off about this.-No lock on: You must fix this for future DMC games-Missed opportunity: They should have made this a spin off rather than a reboot. In other words continue the old DMC story in DMC5 and start this as a new series. A horrible decision that has hurt the sales of this great game.*************************CONCLUSION********************************This is a great game and I hope Capcom gives Ninja Theory a second chance to make a sequel but more importantly I also hope that they continue the previous DMC series. If you are a DMC fan who is still angry with Capcom or Ninja Theory, I suggest that you put that anger aside and give this game a shot, especially now that it is a bit cheaper. I will say it again the story and plot really kept me going.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"New to Series","reviewText":"Like the title of the thread says, this review comes from someone entirely new to the Splinter Cell series.  Therefore, I don't have history with the mechanics of gameplay, the characters, or the multiplayer.  So let me take the review step by step.Single Player:Fun experience and fairly easy to get familiar with.  Anyone with experience with shooters or the Metal Gear series, preferably both, will be be able to get comforatble with the gameplay relatively quickly.  The game is very much a stealth game with a large focus on staying hidden and taking out enemies silently.  Even more so than the MGS games where you could get away with a guns blazing strategy to a certain extent.  Not so much here, guns blazing will get you killed in short order.  Sometimes this can lead to aggravation but generally the game on normal mode isn't too punishing.There are lots of ways to upgrade your charater as well.  You complete missions and objectives to earn money and then spend that money on upgrading everything, you headquarters, your arsenal, and your gear.  This gives it a sort of leveling up vibe that is nice for the RPGers in some of us.Story wise it's your basic \"terrorist group has it in for the US, and it's your job as a one man army to stop them\".  Not exactly crazy original, but it works.Multiplayer:I'm not a huge MP guy and while I know lots of people that love this version of MP, I got completely owned and that wasn't a lot of fun.  Maybe I'm used to a more CoD/Killzone type of play but walking into a couple of games that were rated beginner and facing guys with copmlete invisibility upgrades and getting knifed over and over wasn't my thing.  I'm not deducting and points for this as it is all probably just me but that was my experience.  Yours could be entirely different.Co-op:The game also includes secondary missions that can be played either co-op, local split-screen or online, or as a single player.  Here's where I have a bit of an issue.  These missions are available from the beginning of the game and unlike the main SP campaign are MUCH harder in SP. I'd like to play them but they are just aren't any fun trying to beat in SP mode.Summary:This is a game that packs in a lot of value and has some very enjoyable parts, but that value depends on whether you play online MP or at least have a partner to do co-op with. I suppose this is a critique of modern shooters in general so take all this with a grain of salt and dive in if well done stealth is your thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

Everything looks, plays, sounds, and acts perfectly. This is one refined game.The amount of depth to this game is crazy too. From the hundreds of souls you can gather, which is insanely addictive, to the numerous awesome weapons you can forge, this game will keep you item gatherers busy.And if youre just a casual player then this game has what you want too. A nice story, fun gameplay, and some challenge thrown in for good measure.Also, sealing the monsters away for good with the stylus is surprisingly fun. It adds a great deal of tension to already tough boss battles.

More than just a video game console, this system is also a top-notch Blu-Ray player.  It plays regular DVDs as well as Blu-Ray.  If you have a high definition TV, or are planning to get one in the future, the PS3 should be on your shopping list.I own all of the major video game consoles, with the exception of the Nintendo Wii.  The Playstation 3 gets the most usage because of its versatility.  Not only does it play Blu-Ray and regular DVD, it is also capable of downloading movies and television shows from the Playstation Store.  There are currently over 1,000 movies available for rent or download from the Playstation Store, and the inventory is growing at a very rapid rate.  Even if you do not play games, you will find it hard to ever be bored if you have one of these consoles in your living room.All three of the major consoles (PS3, XBox360, Wii, PS2) have big blockbuster games coming out in 2009.  The PS3 lineup, just like the PS2's, promises to have something for everyone, from the casual gamers to the hardcore players.  If you are looking to buy a console that the whole family can use, you will find it in the PS3.This version of the PS3 will not play video games that were made for the PS2.  This function, referred to as \"backwards compatibility\" is available only on the more expensive ($500) model of the PS3.  If there is something to be criticized about this otherwise perfect console, it would have to be that, the lack of backwards compatibility.  If backwards compatibility is important to you, then you will need to spend an additional $100 and purchase the PS3 model with that feature, like I did.  For most people, I suspect that backwards compatibility may not be that important.  It is important if you own a very large library of PS2 games.  If not, then save the money and buy this model.I have tried both models and eventually decided to get the one with backwards compatibility, but that is because I currently have a large inventory of older video games.  For your information, I buy and sell video games for additional income.  In other words, you might say I am a \"pro\".  But most people will not demand that much from their consoles (I also own the Elite version of the XBox 360).  This PS3 model should be more than what the typical user will ever need.The Sony Playstation brand has always stood for good value right from the start.  There are many games for the Playstation and the Playstation 2 that have actually gone up in value over the years.  I have recently sold an original edition (black label, not Greatest Hits) of the Playstation game \"Xenogears\" for $120!  Last year, I sold a copy of Final Fantasy 7 for about the same amount of money.  I do believe that no other brand in video games hold their value, or in some cases appreciate in value, than the Playstation brand.  You really cannot go wrong should you invest in the brand.  I am hoping the same thing will happen with the PS3.This model, like all other PS3 model, does not come with an HDMI cable.  You will get the very best picture quality through HDMI.  You should be able to pick up one of these cables from any of your major retailers for a small amount of money.  I suggest that you use HDMI.  The 80GB hard drive is very easy, and very cheap, to upgrade.  It uses the same hard drive as most laptop computers.This version of the PS3 console benefits from the latest Sony engineering.  It actually operates cooler than the other model and uses less power.  The backwards compatible model uses the older power supply, which consumes more power and runs a little bit warmer.  All models of the PS3 operate flawlessly and they do not have a tendency to overheat.  They have proven to be very solid and reliable.  But it is always better to have a unit that operates as cool as possible and uses the least amount of electricity.  The silent operation will also allow you to enjoy your Blu-Ray and DVDs even in a quiet room.  Basically, this is the PS3 model that I would recommend for most people.Should you buy a video game/entertainment console this Holiday season?In my humble opinion, these entertainment consoles are the greatest entertainment value for your dollar during these tough economic times.  If you compare the cost of a vacation, or the cost of taking your family out to the movies, you will see that the cost of a video game console compares very favorably.  And these consoles (at least the Sony consoles) have the potential to last for a long time.  My PS2 is eight years old and still runs perfectly.  There is no reason not to expect the same durability from the PS3.  And let's remember that this console plays movies.  This console can really open up all kinds of entertainment possibilities for you and your family this Holiday season, and beyond.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2008"}

The mainly-urban setting of the game forces the player to consider many more variables than in previous stealth-style games.The player takes the role of Desmond Miles, who himself is taking the role of his ancestor, Altair, an ancient assassin. Reliving the life of his ancestor through the use of a genetic memory machine called the Animus, Desmond's story intertwines with the events that his ancestor lived through. The mysterious group forcing Desmond to use the Animus, as well as details about the characters Desmond and Altair interact with, are fleshed out as the game continues.Almost the entire game - except for short sessions between Animus uses - is spent as Altair, and thus he is the focal character in the game. Altair is tasked to kill 9 key figures in the Templar and Crusader hierarchy, each in a different part of one of the game's three cities (not including the assassin's stronghold). To achieve this, Altair must gather intelligence by eavesdropping, pickpocketing valuable documents, and getting information from informants. Furthermore, Altair must prepare for the assassination itself; mapping out the city from high points and helping the local populace, who will then return the favor if Altair is being pursued by guards. The cities are vibrant and dynamic, and interaction with its people is a key trait. Activities that will not arouse suspicion, for example, tend to be low-key things like gently moving through a crowd (pushing people softly aside), walking at a normal pace, and using ladders. In contrast, running or sprinting through a crowded marketplace (knocking people and objects aside) and climbing up the sides of buildings using windows and handholds are things that will draw the attention of the guards.The gameplay handles excellently. Swordfighting is graceful and fluid, and tends to be \"realistic\" more than \"stylized\" despite the inclusion of several \"finishing move\"-type attacks. Altair's weapons include a hidden blade (useful for quiet, non-suspicious attacks), a sword (more damaging, but heavier), a long dagger (quicker and better for counter-attacking), and throwing knives. Altair is graceful and athletic, and can climb almost any building in the game by moving from various handholds. He can also jump from roof to roof and from various other points; the feeling of speed is emphasized especially when Altair stumbles after hitting someone going full speed, or hits the ground and rolls after a jump. Traveling between cities (in the unsettled middle area known as the Kingdom) requires a horse, and horse handling is also done very well.The graphics are absolutely beautiful. The environments, the characters, the effects, and even the heads up display are all both stylized and realistic. Characters animate and move very naturally, and the cities are expansive and don't seem like the same 10 buildings over and over. The heads up display, especially, is seamlessly integrated into the story; it represents the Animus, which is noted in the manual to be designed to work like a game to better acclimate subjects to it. The game is a cinematic experience most of the way through, and its visuals are of the highest quality.The sound is not particularly notable, and is possibly the weakest part of the game. Music is rare, only illuminating fight scenes, and is mostly forgettable. Voices tend to be well-done, in terms of accents and voicing, but are repetitive. Mostly, the sound is a side-part of the game, and not as notable as the other parts.As a whole, this game is fantastic. It's fun, it looks great, and it's got an interesting urban and medieval twist on the usual sneaking missions. It's definitely recommended to most game fans.Rating: 9/10Note: We enjoyed this game so thoroughly that one of us went through the entire game to write a full walkthrough, and the other went all the way through to validate it. The graphics are just amazingly realistic in terms of movement and fighting style.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

My brothers purchased a newer xbox than mine, and it came with a black controller with the matte gray lining.  The controller really felt no different than my white ones, and I really liked the black, so I thought I would get this one, and get it in gloss just to mix it up a bit.  I was surprised to find that the quality of this controller was far superior than the black and gray controller.  I am not sure if the batch that I got uses different parts or what, but the controller feels a lot more sturdy, the joysticks are nice and strong (they dont wiggle much in their neutral position) and the buttons have a stronger feel to them.  Now some people might say that this is because it is a new controller, but I have been using this one now for about 5 months and the controller is just like the day I bought it.  Again, I dont have proof that the components of this controller have changed, but they sure do feel better than any of the older xbox controllers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000JHMJDA","description":"Need for Speed Carbon PS3","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"PS3's Need To Race","reviewText":"The Playstation 3 system has definitely been recognized as one of the most popular video game systems on the holiday market today. Although there have been many different games that have thrived from the earlier Playstations that Electronic Arts have delivered well on, there is arguably one game that has the rush for anybody who wants to be a street demon, Need For Speed. Since it debuted a decade ago, it has been recognized as one of the best racing game series of all time. The last version, Need For Speed: Most Wanted, did a fantastic job at bringing in new reved up racers to all game consoles alike. Now, a new chapter has helped Need For Speed make its debut on the Playstation 3, but does it deliver like its PS2 counterpart?Need For Speed Carbon for the Playstation 3 is a wild and driven racing game that deliver mostly well for all gamers of all kinds. The game picks up mostly well, as you enter Palmont City, eager for a new challenge after Rockport's Most Wanted madness, as you race your way, trying to conquer the streets with your crew. The game features nearly all the excitement, as you race your way to the top of the heat, to tackle Darius and his league of underground racers. The game features all the classic cars you've come to love from the Mazda RX-8, to exoticas like the Porsche Carrera, and also classic muscle cars like the Dodge Charger, and the Plymouth Challenger as well. There are also thrilling tracks that make the game shine well from circuit races, and speedtraps against the cops, to the return of drifting tracks, something that wasn't seen since Underground 2. The graphics are polished up noblely well, and thrive with each speed of the gameplay. There are however, a couple of disadvantages to the game. One of them, is that you don't have as much challenge against the police as you did with Need For Speed Most Wanted. The other disadvantage, is the muscle cars are very difficult to control for new gamers, and take a whole lot just to get used to, especially in the challenge mode.Still, even though I wish there could've been more that should have been played in Need For Speed Carbon for the Playstation 3, but it is definitely enough to give any speed demon a thrill of a lifetime. If you have the PS3, than I recommend you place this on your gamelist. I loved playing this chase, and you'll enjoy this need as well.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2+Price: B 1/2-Overall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

Forget playing with a controller, playing with the Kinect is the way to go here. It's an undeniably trippy experience, waving your arms in front of the screen as you destroy all the obstacles and projectiles preventing you from getting to Lumi, the girl you're tasked to save. The best thing is that out of all the Kinect games I've played, this one is the most responsive with the target reticles following your hand gestures with hardly any visible lag time. Selections are made at about double the speed they normally are, taking the Kinect experience and making the interaction between player and sensor a smoother affair.It's all over too quickly but you won't mind as this game rewards multiple playthroughs by offering plenty of unlockables ranging from art galleries, video filters and other cool features.Child of Eden is an audio/visual feast. The graphics are spectacular and raise the bar for other shooters as far as I'm concerned. It's the kind of game that looks so great that even people who abhor videogames have no choice but to look on as this game is played. Coupled with the thumping tunes, it's literally a perfect marriage of sight and sound. For this game to be played properly, you have to allow yourself to get lost in the music because maintaining the maximum amount of score multiplier bonuses requires you to fire your homing lasers on the beat. I didn't realize it at first but it wasn't until I figured it out that I suddenly became aware of how interactive this game truly is. Before you even realize it, you'll be moving in time with the music, allowing yourself to be taken over by the rhythm of it all.If I have any complaints, it's only that playing this game can wear your arms out. I played three stages back to back and by the end of the third one, I literally had to hold my right arm up with the left, much to the entertainment of my wife who was watching me play. The game addresses this by occasionally posting up alerts suggesting a break if you're feeling sore. It's a minor complaint and other than the game being too short, there's very little to find fault with in this game.Child of Eden is a game that should be experienced by all, especially those with the Kinect. The game is being released later this year for the PS3 but even with PS3 Move support, I just don't see it coming close to the experience that playing Child of Eden really is when it's being played hands free.Absolutely recommended, especially for those that are familiar with the game Rez, which is the forefather of the Child of Eden experience and also created by Eden's designer, Tetsuya Mizuguchi.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2011"}

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"This is the best system for me and my family to play","reviewText":"The Wii Hardware Bundle comes with two discs loaded with fun games and a just about everything you're going to need. It is a sleek console, with a nice, reflective gloss. The Wii is compact and quieter than my bulky but powerful PS3. There are tons of things to do besides play games, like check your local weather, but the best feature of all is the out-of-this-world technology of the motion-control! It really is something to try out for yourself.Rather than the gimmicky Playstation motion or the Xbox kinetics that are after-thoughts, the Wii was made with the idea of swinging your controller around and mimicking real actions on the screen. The effects are surprising and enthralling! It is a good idea to buy an extraWii Remote Plus - Blackand alsoWii Nunchuk Controller - Black. Games likeDonkey Kong Country ReturnsandSuper Mario Galaxy 2will need it.I mentioned that the Wii comes with most of what you need. Something else you may need to buy isNintendo Wii 480p Component Video and Stereo Audio Gold-Plated Cablebecause it comes with AV cables. If you own a wide screen TV it will look much better. Besides this, the extra remote plus and Wii nunchuk controller as already written above. Besides these things you will need to set up your internet if desired. The Wii is surprisingly Wifi! The Wii has many blocks on your welcome screen that are filled with tutorial videos that need to be watched and then deleted, to free up memory, because the Wii does not come with alot. To surf the internet you need to download its program into a block taking up roughly a quarter of your memory blocks. If you plan on purchasing and downloading retro Nintendo games likeSuper Mario Bros. 3you will need to download another program into a block, and you will need to buy some external memory cardsSanDisk Wii 2GB Secure Digital SD Gaming Memory Card - Bulk Packagingwhich are pretty cheap!The Wii is Gamecube compatible also! You can plug in 4 Gamecube controllers and start playing classic games likeSuper Mario Sunshinethat perhaps you never enjoyed before! When I was younger, I didn't have the gamecube, our family went with the PS2, so I missed out on alot of great games. It will be great to explore the many great games on that system! The Wii plays DVD games but does not play DVD movies. If you would like to watch movies you can download for free Netflix and watch streaming movies. I have Netflix on my PS3, because it is in HD and in surround sound, which the Wii does not support.I wanted a Wii badly because I am a retro gamer who doesn't really like online games. I really didn't have games to play with my family on the PS3! I wanted to playMario Kart Wii with Wii Wheelwhere everyone in the room can have fun and interact. They create memories that last forever and help keep a happy home. You will not be locked up in a dark room untill 3am playing online games and getting so mad you curse to yourself! The Wii really is about sharing experiences with people you know. There really isn't anything out there that will get my Dad, and grandparents, and the young side of my family together to play games they all enjoy! It is great for kids also! You can keep track of how long your kids play games because the Wii sends you email reports of how many hours their \"Mii's\" or game personalities, they played for and what games in particular. It gives you details that you as a parent may need such as the time and date, and what they liked playing most. You have the option of parental control also.The Wii has countless games and is the centerpiece of entertainment for a family house or retro gamer. It is neat and compact, so it can fit in even the most over-stuffed entertainment center! It can stand up or lay down right out of the box unlike PS3 and other systems. The Wii is the best console I have played since N64! And as I play more and more games I have no doubt that I will grow to appreciate it more and more. It was the perfect holiday present!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}

That's great,isnt it? Here's the thing, almost all of the games that they've remade have absolutly NO changes! In some cases, I would consider this a good thing, but with this game you've got to be kidding me?!? I've played through the entire game once before, and although it is a very fun & charming game, well... Put it this way, they should have at least changed it a little. Couldnt they have fixed all of the little annoyences in the game? For example, Links eyes & mouth are noting but green rectangles, couldnt they fix that by making the rectangles that make up Link's eyes blue, and the one for his mouth red? I wouldnt want them to completely overhaul the game, just fix a few things like the one that I listed above.Another problem that I've always had with this game is that you're supposed to be saving the land of Hyrule, did I miss something or has it already been wiped-out? Honestly, am I the only one who's ever noticed that there's nothing to save???There are no buildings, no people, and no towns or castles in this game! I'm sorry, but I need to feel obligated by a games story to complete it, and there's no obligation because Link has absolutely nothing to save but a dusty-old wasteland and the only human being that lives there! Oh-no! Please Ganon, dont destroy that uh... Tree! No Ganon! You vindictive fiend, dont blow up that uh... Um... Hey wait, what am I afraid of? There's absolutly nothing of value for you to destroy!!! As for the Princess Zelda, tell her to call me when she has a land worth saving.-LinkPros: A classic NES title remade to fit on your GBA, very challenging & interesting game, lots of weapons & items to collect, and a powerful enemy to defeat!Cons: Nothing about this game has been changed! Even the things that despretly needed to be changed werent changed!!!There's nothing to save from ganon's wrath because there are no towns or people anywhere! And Ganon, the king of evil, is nothing more than a giant blue-skinned pig in battle armor!Do you want to play a Zelda game with towns & people to save?Then buy any other Zelda title there is!Closing thoughts: Altough this game has a few things that I would have liked to have seen updated or changed, it is still a fun game and it's worth he small price that they're charging for it.My favorite Zelda titles include, The Legend of Zelda: The ocarina of time, The Legend of Zelda: Link's awakening, and The Legend of Zelda: The wind waker.Wrtten by: ShadowMage (The game maniac)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2005"}

Red Faction II features a revamped Geo-Mod engine to provide dynamically destructive environments, an elite squad of soldiers and 14 weapons of destruction to aid your overthrow of the tyrant governor!","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"Not quite as fun as the original","reviewText":"Red Faction 2 continues the saga of the underground resistance but this time on Earth and against an oppressive government called the Commonwealth.  Their military has used nanotechnology to create a unit of super soldiers.  The squad, which you're a part of each is a specialist in certain areas (sniper/covert ops, heavy weapons etc).  Fearing his own creations the leader of the Commonwealth (Sopot) orders his creations to be hunted down and executed.  This is roughly where your story begins.  You're Alias (an explosives expert) and you must survive long enough to topple the Commonwealth.  My thoughts;Pros+ Decent story, comparable to the original Red Faction.+ Some great voice acting by famous actors like Lance Henriksen and Jason Statham.+ Ability to dual wield guns and a greater emphasis on explosive weapons. Also a respectable array of weapons to choose from.+ Short but sweet ability to pilot mech-like suits against your enemies. Also a few short vehicle gunner sequences.+ Multiple endings depending upon the games \"Heroics\" rating system.+ Solid physics and the Geo-Mod Technology (the ability to destroy environments) is still a lot of fun.Cons- Geo-Mod Technology seemed more limited than in the first Red Faction.- Some levels were overly difficult (not impossible) and lacked clear direction as to where to proceed next. A few enemies were also rather difficult when they were able to one-shot kill you.- Lackluster cutscenes and lip-synching.- Annoying checkpoint Save system.- Boss fights are somewhat predictable.- mediocre graphics.- A bit to short.While this title didn't quite live up to the feel of the original Red Faction it was still a fun but short shoot-em up.  If you enjoyed the first title then you should feel relatively at home here except that you're no longer on Mars but on Earth.  You don't necessarily have to play the first game to follow the storyline of the second one but it couldn't hurt.  Red Faction II didn't really break any new ground but it was a satisfying ride.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Very very happy with this version","reviewText":"I'm a huge halo fan, have been since the day it was released.  I bought the Xbox for one thing only - to play Halo.  And for 10 years now, it's the game I've played the most.  My son, who is 8, has been playing it for about 2 years, and it's his favorite game as well.We've gone through all the Halo games, and while the graphics were nicer and they were visually appealing, I found that none of them immersed me nearly as well as the first one did.  It wasn't about graphics, it was a first person shooter, pure and simple.  Halo CE still is my favorite one as far as the controls.  I really disliked what they did with them for Halo 2, and 3 was at least better than 2, but I always preferred the layout in Halo CE.  And the story was gripping.  It pulled you into its universe and you got a chance to live and breathe in it.  The only other games that have had this same immersive, enjoyable playability (and RE-playability) are the Elder Scrolls games for us.  Because while we purchased and played and enjoyed all the various Halo games that have been released, there's only one we always came back to time after time.  The first, which was, for us, the best.So when I heard this summer they were rebooting it with graphics but keeping the play the same, I was thrilled.  It was the play that I enjoyed, and while I always appreciated the graphics on each successive title, I always went back to Halo CE for our playing.  I had Halo Reach and Halo ODST since they came out, and only actually played them through and finished them a few weeks ago. I played a couple levels on each and then they sat while we did other things including the first Halo.  But having the awesome graphics in ADDITION to the game I always enjoyed playing was just heaven.And I have to say, it has lived up to my expectation.  I'm a little bummed that the B button isn't the \"hit\" anymore, but rather the right shoulder button, but I can live with that, because they were right, this is exactly like playing the original.  AI acts the same, things all are just identical.  They really nailed it with the dual engine, using the original for the AI and overlaying the other for the graphics.  Switching between them is nice, but it fades to black between versions, and takes a few seconds, so not recommended in the middle of a firefight. ;)But seeing all the places I've come to know every bit as well as the neighborhood I grew up in, all remastered with the current level of graphics capabilities, it's just mind blowing for us hardcore original Halo players.  Every time I turn around, every time I hit a new spot on a level, my jaw drops.  It's absolutely fantastic.So if you enjoyed the first Halo, get it.  If you never played the original, get it, because it'll be every bit as enjoyable as any other \"current\" game despite actually being 10 years old.Kudos to all involved in the creation of this.  I don't see this as any kind of grab for \"more money\" but a true tribute to the game that arguably made the Xbox as successful as it is - because most of the Xbox players I know were like I was, and purchased one for this single game 10 years ago.Long Live Master Chief!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

This was my first time playing Animal Crossing, so the lack of updates or upgrades didn't affect me.This game - at first - was incredibly addictive.  It passed any Wii Game I had ever played - even Boom Blox.  The concept is so incredibly simple - a little town to run around in and do... ...just about whatever you want.  The graphics are cartoonish and cute, the controls are unbelievably easier - even better with a nunchuck attachment - and it's just good, clean, easy fun.  I got hooked on the commercials and rented it.  My wife thought it would be \"stupid.\"  Two days later I was buying the game per HER request!  Now our \"town\" has the new bridge, the water fountain, all kinds of good stuff.Unfortunately, Animal Crossing gets old kinda quick.  At first you'll find yourself building mental \"to do\" lists - there's always something else you want to do.  Then you start getting the furniture you want, you get your house upgraded all the way, you get the in-town shop to upgrade all the way, and suddenly you find yourself repeating the same tasks over and over again.  Fish, pick fruit, sell for \"bells\" (money), talk to AI characters, fish, pick fruit, etcetera.  After a while, it just gets monotonous.The nice thing about this is that Animal Crossing is built to work on a Calendar.  Certain events are planned throughout the year.  Some only happen once a year, others every few weeks or months, etc.  This is really nice if you have the time (and ambition) to jump onto AC once a day for twenty or thirty minutes.  Seasons in the game change, Major holidays are celebrated - it's really quite impressive how they built this.The only other downside is that it doesn't support simultaneous play over the same console.  Believe it or not, my wife and I were almost considering a second Wii so that we could play over the internet with each other!  The AI characters don't give you the comradery that you'd like to have - it's too artificial.  We had fun sending letters to each other, buying each other gifts, etc.  But we could never play at the same time and that was always a bummer.  If we had done the \"two Wii's\" technique, we'd have each had different towns, which wouldn't have been the same as working together to improve \"our\" town.  We ultimately decided not to bother.Animal Crossing: City Folk has the potential to entertain a family-full of people (apparently up to four people) for a very, very long time.  You won't get hours of play-time a day, but you'll get something different almost every day, and I think that builds value in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000R1A0L6","description":"Godzilla Unleashed - Everyone's favorite monster returns in a completely redesigned and updated massively destructive brawler! Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Stephen J. Carlson","summary":"A Decent Game, But Not Much More...","reviewText":"Godzilla Unleashed is a new storyline from Atari.  There are four factions - Earth Defenders, The GDF (Global Defense Force), the Aliens, and the Mutants.  The storyline itself is simple - basically all you need to know is that the four factions are occupying the same planet, and they are TIRED of each other's presence.  The cut scenes are so painfully 1995 that I rarely let one play all the way through - I just couldn't take the hokey dialogue and campy soundtrack that long.  That said, I suppose the soundtrack and dialogue could be rather entertaining in an \"ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US\" sort of way.The graphics are nothing to write home about - they wouldn't give a PS2's graphic chipset much trouble.  The Wii is capable of quite a bit more, I should think.  But the objects are recognizable and the fact that most of the landscape is destructible helps.  The monsters themselves are fairly well-rendered, and their attacks and power surges look pretty good.  The thing is, I thought the old Mortal Kombat for the PS2 looked much better - more detailed characters, more spectacular attacks, etc.The gameplay itself is decent, but not outstanding.  The Wii controls are utilized to an extent - shaking the nunchuck upward jumps; shaking the nunchuck and remote downward together picks up objects; swinging the remote while pressing attack buttons modifies the attack.  But the uses made of the Wii controls lack the intuitive, natural motion that many Wii games have been able to achieve.  The advantage of the Wii control system in the first place is that controlling games becomes more of a natural motion instead of memorizing button presses.  This game merely substitutes controller motions for button presses, a move that isn't much more satisfying than using, say, a PS2 or Gamecube controller.  Instead of making this game an innovative use of the Wii platform, it reduces it to a glorified button-masher ala Mike Tyson Punchout for NES.The storyline is rather easy to complete.  The most enjoyable part of the gameplay is the multiplayer, where four players can battle it out.  This makes the repeat playing value significantly higher, but when copies of the old Super Smash Brothers Melee are lying around, Godzilla Unleashed is likely to be neglected.Bottom line: a decent game, but unless you're a big fan of the Godzilla movies and games of the past, I would wait for a bargain-bin price on this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2008"}
