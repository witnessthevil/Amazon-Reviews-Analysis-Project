This game is quite a bit removed from its predecessors, and knowledge of past storylines is not essential (and in fact, is quite useless) to the plot of this tale. Here, we are treated to a multi-person storyline, as the player follows the exploits of Hugo, a war chieftain in the grasslands (the son of Lucia from Suikoden 2), Chris, a knight in the service of Zexen, and Geddoe, a mercenary of the holy kingdom of Harmonia. The peace of half a century is about to be broken by an old friend (who shall remain nameless; the surprise is half the fun) and these three countries are about to wage war on one another. Only the Flame Champion, a nearly mythical hero of fifty years past, can stop this carnage.The problem with Suikoden 3 is twofold. The graphics are terrible. Konami has decided to bring Suikoden in the world of 3D, with disastrous results. Every country, every person looks washed out, and the stars of destiny (which, by the way, are taken from an excellent Chinese novel, \"Outlaws of the Marsh\") look pretty much like commoners. Also, the tripartite storyline fails to impress, as we never get a feel for ANY of the characters, except (surprisingly) the villain, which is playable if the \"good\" ending is found. I enjoyed the game somewhat, but always found myself asking, \"OK, so when will this take off?\" Unfortunately, the game never does. Here's to hoping that Suikoden 4 gets it right (it's been announced in Japan!).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"A. Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Good, but didn't live up to its potential","reviewText":"Rainbow Six Vegas was, in my opinion, a fantastic game.  It combined very slick gameplay with stunning graphics and an immersive story, and threw in nice touches like an epic soundtrack and a fun \"terrorist hunt\" mode.With this as a basis, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 should have been even better, but unfortunately it falls short of the mark.  On the one hand, Ubisoft improved nearly every aspect of gameplay (I'll get to that), but on the other, the game is just MISSING something.On the positive side, there are plenty of new touches that fix most of my gripes about the previous game.  Melee is still missing, much to my annoyance (there are plenty of opportunities when it would be preferable), but you can now sprint in short bursts (handled in the standard CoD manner, but with the left bumper).  I couldn't honestly tell if pistol firing was as fast as your finger could pull (the old game had a very low firecap which was very irritating), but it seemed faster anyway.  The graphics are impressively better; original Vegas had some great visuals, so seeing even more detail and lighting effects is a nice touch.  There is an improved assortment of weapons, including the SR-25 sniper rifle, a favorite of mine ever since SOCOM:  US Navy SEALs.  Unfortunately, as before, you can only put one attachment on each weapon, so you'll have to choose between things like \"recoil stock to prevent ridiculous muzzle climb\" and \"sight/scope to get any remotely useful benefit from LMG at ranges greater than point blank.\"  I suppose that too much weight would slow down an operative, and this is the reasoning, but it's kind of annoying at times.  You can now see how many breaching charges and grenades your team is carrying.  Checkpoints seem to be more frequent, which is a plus considering that the enemy AI is also noticeably tougher.  In fact, this game proved to be very challenging even on \"Normal\" difficulty; enemies have razor-sharp senses and very good aim.A new and considerably extensive feature is character customization.  Instead of playing as a standard-issue \"Logan Keller,\" (you'll be playing as \"Bishop\" anyway), you can alter your appearance including facial features/race, facial hair (not really visible in-game), and clothing.  The latter is the most notable, because your clothing is also topped with body armor, and there are about a dozen different types, with varying levels of protection and encumbrance.  You can put on the heaviest armor possible and take a few more bullets, but you'll move slower and respond more sluggishly.  You can also change your helmet and choose to wear sunglasses or goggles, which I personally think is cool.  A silly detail of this, however, is that even if you opt to go with no helmet at all, you'll still have access to thermal and night vision, as if by magic (even looking at yourself in third person with NVG on reveals nothing over your eyes, although the goggles do flip down if you are wearing the standard issue helmet).  The \"equipment\" lockers placed throughout each level now include clothing and armor, as well, so you can change your setup mid-mission.  This is actually very handy as you may encounter a very heavy firefight after a segment where stealth and speed are critical, and wish to bulk up your armor.Another new feature is a level-up system that takes effect during all modes of gameplay, including the campaign.  Each kill that you get adds to your XP, with various types of kills and actions counting higher than others.  As you level up, you'll advance in rank and unlock new weapons and armor.  This adds to the replay value, because modes like terrorist hunt continue to advance your level.The co-op modes are a nice feature, with the challenging (VERY challenging) terrorist hunt mode being a fun split-screen pastime.  I haven't played online, due to my lack of a connection, but it's an option as well.Despite all these good things and improvements over the original, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 just doesn't quite hit the mark.  The reason isn't quite apparent, but I have a few theories.  First, the original game ended in a cliff-hanger that definitely warranted a sequel.  After setting themselves up nicely for future sales, however, it seems that Ubisoft got tired of working on it and rushed it to completion.  Despite being much more difficult than the original, I was stunned by how quickly the game was over.  I expected to unlock most of the weapons by the end of the campaign as I advanced in rank (although it was probably designed more for multiplayer), but I was still a lowly Staff Sergeant when I finished, and I was left with a hollow feeling, kind of like when you prepare to eat a meal and then have it taken away halfway through eating.What's more, while the first game had an introduction in Mexico and then spent the rest of its time in the glitzy, slot machine and neon laden Las Vegas for which the game was titled until the grand finale, \"Vegas 2\" starts in Europe, briefly visits Vegas, hitting a few casinos, then heads out to the Nevada desert and finally to Central America.  Since I really enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of the Vegas setting, this disappointed me too.  The new locations fit the storyline, but Vegas still should have been the focus.Comparing the concurrent storylines of Vegas 1 and 2 justfies my complaint about game length and locale.  In Vegas 1, after the introduction in Mexico, Logan Keller joins Michael and Jung for the entire rest of the game (90% or more).  In Vegas 2, Bishop works with Michael and Jung until they leave to join Logan, then performs a solo mission in an oil refinery.  Right after that, he's back with Mike and Jung to find Gabriel (after the events of Vegas 1).  This oil refinery mission does not constitute 90% of the game, hence the overwhelming feeling of a large chunk being left out.  In general, the story was weak and the game felt like an expansion pack rather than a sequel.  The finale was challenging and meant to be emotional, but came off as fairly cheesy.  While Logan, Michael, and Jung played an epic role as the first line of defense in Vegas, kicking the terrorists in the teeth and foiling their plans to micropulse everything (and consequently making you, the player, feel like a hardcore hero), Bishop and his various companions in Vegas 2 seemed like a second-rate backup force, wandering around and failing to accomplish anything noteworthy (and failing, per script, to accomplish many of their initial goals).  Of course this makes you, the player, feel lame as well.My last broad complaint is about the graphics.  Earlier I said that they were better and more detailed, which is true.  However, for whatever reason, everything seemed too clean and perfect, even when it was destroyed.  Shapes are simple and the whole game resembled a very obvious Adobe Illustrator graphic.  Replete with detail, but lacking some aspect of realism that made everything toy-like.  I played Vegas 1 and 2 back-to-back (my second time going through the original), so the fact that I noticed this in Vegas 2 indicates that it's a new and different thing, likely a result of the new graphical touches.Other complaints are minor, like a soundtrack that lacks the power of the original, heavily recycled enemy dialogue from the original (although the comically repeated \"Chris ain't here\" line is absent), and a few gameplay details I already addressed.In conclusion, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is a very slick game that provides good entertainment and replay value via modes like terrorist hunt, but lacks the clout of its predecessor, due to a weak plot, unimportant player role, short duration, oddly toyish graphics, and lack of Las Vegas content.  You may want to rent this one, or buy it used.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I08WVY","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek Vazquez \"DaFynestRican\"","summary":"JRPG Heaven","reviewText":"I miss these games:  all at once overly dramatic and delightfully silly, with a cast of distinct if not cliche characters and music that gets stuck in your head for hours after you've put it down. Of course, Im referring specifically to JRPGs. I understand that the masses are moving toward western designs when it comes to their rolepaying fixes, so maybe it's just that I grew up on these so nostalgia surely pays it's part.I'd never played Tales of The Abyss, though I have played other games in the series, so it didn't take much for me to jump right in. Namco Bandai pretty much reuses the same structure for it's Tales games. Guess that means if you don't like any one particular game in the series for be it design, art direction, or whatever you won't like this one. I've read that everything minus the multiplayer has made in intact in the 3DS port, which is only slightly disappointing. It woud have been nice to have it, but I recall it was never easy to get someone to sit and play with me anyhow.Graphically, the anime-style characters and varied backdrops are easy on the eyes, with both being detailed enough to stand out while retaining a simplistic charm. I found the color palette to be slighty muted, but that's my opinion. Not sure if the same can be said of the original, but regardless it looks good on the 3DS' 16:9 screen. The 3D effect is another matter. It is understated to the point where it seems almost unnecessary. In many scenes I found it made little difference whether the effect was off or dialed all the way up and in the end I turned it completely off. It's not an important gripe and the game is great otherwise.As far as story is concerned I found TOTA to be one of the better games in the series. This game came from a time where companies strived to make you feel a connection for these fictional personas and it shows. For every character you cant stand theres one or two that will make you smile and keep rooting for them throughout. The Narrative is delivered well enough that you know whats going on but it doesnt get too convoluted.Overall I really liked TOTA on 3DS. Its also great to finally have a more traditional RPG experience on the system, with the only other RPG experience available being Shin Megami Tensei for those who prefer strategy more. I'd recommend this to any fan of the series, or those looking for a more involved experience on their Nintendo Portable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

Be the hero embarking on an epic quest or a thief rising to leadership of his guild. Be a sorcerer developing the ultimate spell of destruction or a healer searching for the cure to a plague. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit. Change character or creature attributes and skills, introduce new weapons or dungeons into the game, or create entire new worlds to explore.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"One of the most overrated games of all time","reviewText":"I honestly do not see what everyone else does in this game. I bought it based on the all the tremendous hype it received. I was really excited about the game when I first played it, but within a week of installing it, I realized that it just wasn't all it was made up to be by all the hype.The world is expansive, yes. In fact, its overwhelming. The landscapes look great and the enviornmental and weather effects are amazing. The problem with this gigantic world is that it is sparsely populated. You only see signs of life when you go into towns or dungeons. Most of the time the wilderness is uninhabited. And that makes the game lonely. In fact, this game is like playing Ever Quests and other similar massive online games...except you are the only player. There is no one else. And that gets lonely. Why a multi-player option was not included is beyond comprehension.The character models are quite possibly the ugliest character models I have ever seen in a game. The faces are hideous, and all the models look deformed and blocky. This is not because of a system configuration (my computer running top of the line hardware), it is just horrible character design. Further adding to the feeling of repetition, there are only about 5 or 6 different faces per race, further split up between gender. So, with hundreds of NPC's in the game, you see the same faces repeated...ALOT. Not only are all the faces and character models virtually identical, but they all repeat the same text over and over. Although there is a long and involved story in the game, I could never follow it. I didn't find it interesting at all, and frankly, since every character said virtually the same thing, after a while I just found myself not really caring what NPC's said. I ignored them completely. That made the game utterly boring. Maybe its my own fault, but I honestly just got sick of reading the same text over and over from the repetetive NPCs.Creating your character is probably the only entertaining thing about this game. You have the option to pick a pre-existing class, have a custom class created for you by answering questions, or creating your very own class, mixing any abilities that you wish. There are multiple races to choose from, each having unique abilities that set them apart from one another. Picking your appearence is pointless, simply because there aren't many choices, and they all look the same. Plus, you'll see whatever face you pick for yourself repeated over and over in the game on the NPCs, as I mentioned earlier.Upping your skills in the game is simple enough, though it takes hours and hours. If you have the time--and high boredom threshold--you could stand in one spot using your skills over and over and get them up. Using your skills over and over is the only way to advance them, and until you find heavy combat areas, you wont advance much at all.Despite the amazing environmental graphics and weather effects, great ambient sound and sense of exploration, Morrowind just doesn't really cut it. I found the music to be repetetive and dull. There is alot to do in the game, but quests just seem so empty. Of the few quests that I did, I never once got a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. In the end it just felt like more mundane tasks to do, and that made it boring.The heavily touted World Editor allows you to do all types of things, editing almost anything about the game.  You could build your very own world if you had the time and patience.  Oh, and did I mention you need a degree in Quantum Physics to even comprehend how complex the editor is?  Only die-hard, heavily devoted users who would forsake everything else in their life and spend countless hours, days, even weeks trying to learn and master the editor should bother with it.  It is definitely not for the casual editor, or someone with a remote interest in tinkering with the game.If you have countless hours to devote to this game, then you might find it enjoyable. Frankly, I just do not have the time or patience to devote to the game...and it quite simply does not live up in any way to the tremendous hype it received. If the game DID live up to its hype, then I would enjoy it...then I would find the time to devote to this game. In the end, I found it to be nothing more than a repetetive, boring, and dreary gameplay experience. Morrowind should only be played by fanatic, hardcore RPG players. Casual gamers should stay away.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Bioware has another winner here","reviewText":"While December 25th for most people is Christmas, November 3rd was mine. The biggest RPG this side of Oblivion was FINALLY released and that of course is Dragon Age: Origins.Before I get started, I would like everyone to know that I got this for both PC and X360 and I will discuss the specs for each.Installation - Installed in about 10 to 15 mins to the 360 took about a 1/2 an hr for both my desktop and my Macbook Pro in bootcamp.Graphically speaking, the game looks great on my desktop. I am running a 256Gb Overclocked Nvidia 8600GT so i can run most setting on medium to high with little slowdown.Surprisingly, the Xbox's graphics are a bit disappointing. Some of the colors are muted and some of the faces look a bit mashed and when doing cut scenes there is quite a bit of jitter and when there are many things going onscreen at once, the frame rate takes a hit. And that's bad considering how great Mass Effect looked 2 years ago and this is keeping in mind that again, I installed this game on my 360's hard drive.On the Macbook, (Nvidia 9400M) it runs ok with all the settings down low and actually looks pretty ok despite the settings, but it's what I expected. I installed it on the laptop because I will be traveling quite a bit during the holidays and I don't want to drag my 360 everywhere I go! I do plan to boost the onboard RAM and I am hopeful that it will help the game run a bit better.Camera-wise, the PC has the best option in that you can go from a 3rd person POV to an over world tactical view which lets you plan on where to move next and formulate your fight plans.Control wise, while the PC has superior controls (as most PC RPGs do anyway) surprisingly the 360 manages to keep everything organized and easy to find using the control pad but still it's a shame if you are using a mage you are still limited by key assignments where you can place your most used spells.Now, playwise, (***Warning there will be spoilers!***)I am using a male elf mage on the 360 and a female Human warrior on the laptop. I put this in detail for the very reason to test what I have read so far in that NPCs will treat you different ways and indeed they do! In some areas people will indeed talk down to the mage because he is an elf as elves are the minority in this game and in the other instance many will be shocked that a woman is also a warrior. Thank you Bioware for putting these issues in this game. I have actually gotten to see at least one character react differently to these 2 characters of mine and expect to see more!One thing I have noted so far is that the mage's origin story takes a little longer to play as that character has to go through an initiation phase to become who he sets out to be and this is even before he is set to become a Grey Warden and something tells me that within that portion, will play itself out later on in the game! As for the choices you make early on much of the mage's story concerns himself with another apprentice there and his breaking of the rule while in training to become a mage. This storyline gives you a taste of the 1st major decision that will set the game in motion and when that section finishes you will be in for a bit of a surprise and the payoff is nice indeed for it to be so early!The Warrior origin is a bit more straightforward and shorter and involves a family betrayal which winds up in murder. The decision that you make here determines which companion will come with you as you flee for your life.Eventually you start to learn about the Grey Wardens and why they fight the darkspawn. This is where you start to see the difference in this game vs. Oblivion and how Bioware managed to work in so many tried and true stories (Star Wars and LotR specifically)to make the player feel a sense of desperation that the world is looking to you to save it. Some of the places in Felderen while nice to look at does indeed feel dark and dreary most of the time. People are fighting to stay alive and one step ahead of the darkspawn and there is a general feeling that there is little hope left. No one can be trusted but at the same time almost everyone has a story to tell. So, when it was said that this would be a dark fantasy, they were not kidding!The NPC interaction in your party is most interesting of all with just some of the banter that goes back and forth. So, in essence, it's as you heard. They kid around, tease and sometimes hate each other due to your decisions. You cannot do everything to please all of them but this will test you to see how you get through this game by trying to keep your groups together. Also the dialogue for this game so far is excellent!I won't get into the leveling system as I feel that it's something that you as a player would need to see for yourself and tune to your liking.Combat-wise, there is a lot of it and to be quite honest, this could have used a bit more polish as sometimes, it's difficult to distinguish what you are targeting and hoping that you don't hit your friends. Pausing constantly doesn't always work because it detracts from the flow of fighting.10 Hours in, I am very satisfied with this game and I can't wait to see the DLC the comes out for both systems particularly the PC version since there is a toolset that will keep this game going for longer than the original 80 or so hrs that it will keep us busy! So, if you haven't done so, run out and get this game because it's well worth it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2009"}

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels.

While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo.

I think a lot of people did and I think that's a contributing factor to the poor reviews it's received.  I mean, when you're clamoring for a game to be released for more than two years and it's finally released, it's easy to have a feeling of major disappointment when it simply doesn't deliver.  That being said, ACM is not the absolute worst game in the world as many of the reviews would have you to believe.  It's an average FPS with an average story with well...maybe below average graphics.  Alien fans can look it from different perspectives: If you're looking for the intense story line that included plenty of scares and feelings of desperation, then you probably won't find it here.  However, if you're a FPS junkie that likes the idea of a FPS based on the Alien franchise, you might derive some enjoyment from this game.  I mean, it does stay true to the franchise by using authentic sounds (the pulse rifle, tracker and alien screams are spot on.  Not to mention voice acting from the actual stars of the movies).  But it really ends there.  The game is mostly a linear FPS that has you facing Weylan Industries troopers and droves and DROVES of various types of xenomorphs.  That's pretty much it.  I almost felt like I was playing the marine stages of AVP...they are pretty similar.  If you're a huge Alien or FPS fan, I recommend that you wait until this title is around the $20-$30 price point before you buy...renting it would be even better.PROS- Authentic Alien sounds- An OK FPS- Decent FPS controlsCONS- Poor graphics- Bad story line- Not a very good representation of the Alien movie franchise- Can get repetitiveOverall: 5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

A modern dragons lair.","reviewText":"Ryse casts you as a Roman soldier and takes you on various quests throughout different lands (Italy, the UK etc) during their reign as a world power.  The ultimate quest is to get revenge on the emperor himself.This is a fairly standard hack and slash type game although I must admit the graphics on it are beautiful.  Also note that there is a lot of blood are gore so this definitely isn't a game for the younger people.If you are old enough you may remember the game Dragons Lair, when you moved your character at certain times, this is sort of the modern equivalent of that game.  Whilst your character can move fairly freely around the playing area, your strikes, blocks etc. can only happen at certain times. If you don't watch out you can easily queue up multiple moves which in the later level will end up getting you killed as you desperately want to block but have queued up a slash instead.  This happens due to the preset animation which takes a second or two to play out.  During this animation if you press a button on the controller it will queue that up as your next move.It's also a game of color matching.  When fighting enemies, they will flash yellow, red, blue etc. and this is the color of the button on the controller that you should press.  You don't need to if you don't want to but normally that results in your character getting hit.Ryse starts off fairly gently and has good progression in terms of toughness with it getting quite difficult towards the end of the game, even on the easy setting.Stunning graphics and cut scenes but the gameplay is only OK.

{"product_name":"B007VJ06Q6","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"High fantasy beat-em-up heaven on the go","reviewText":"Even before I ripped the cellophane wrap off of the package, I knew I was going to love Dragon's Crown. After all, it was made by one of my favorite game developers, the illustrious Vanillaware. It's evidently set in the same universe asOdin Sphere, one of my all-time favorite video games (and Vanillaware's magnum opus, if you ask me), albeit much, much later in its chronology. It's a beat-em-up with RPG ambitions. It's all guaranteed to be good right? I thought Dragon's Crown was going to be a fun, guilty pleasure diversion between more grand gaming undertakings. Well, I was wrong. Dragon's Crown isn't just \"good,\" it's great, stupendous, marvelous, incredible, damn near PERFECT for its genre. I thought I'd really like DC, but I have been genuinely surprised at how much I love the game. Once again, VW has exceeded my expectations and given me a game I'll cherish for years to come.* Note: I originally bought this game for the PS3 and loved it so much that I ended up buying the PS Vita version as well so I could play it on the go. I have no regrets.Dragon's Crown's tale is a fairly big deviation from the deep, largely character driven tales of VW's past games. Set in the magical kingdom of Hydeland, the story revolves around you, the player, as one of six preset class archetypes, and your adventures as you fight for the kingdom of Hydeland and quest for the mystical Dragon's Crown, an artifact said to hold the power to control dragons. Coming from the more nuanced, character focused narratives of, say, Odin Sphere orMuramasa, DC's story may seem to be disappointingly simplistic and straightforward at first. However, it really does grow on you over time. There are plenty of likable characters that you'll encounter several times, and the story's events have a genuine feeling of impact and importance to them.The whole tale is told via one central character you'll never ever see, a narrator. What a brilliant choice it was to have him! It's no stretch to say he elevates the story from decent to great, at least for me anyway. The way he delivers the lines, as well as the style in which he phrases the story's events definitely lends a MAJOR table top RPG vibe to the game, as if he's the DM and you're playing a game of D&D; or GURPS with your friends. Being reminded of my table top RPG days was powerfully nostalgic for me, and it really made me love the story in this game. When I was young, I used to play beat-em-ups likeGolden Axe,Knights of the Round/King of Dragons, and theDungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara games. Even though those classics didn't have particularly deep stories, they did to me as they inspired my imagination to come up with back-stories, personalities for the characters, possible banter, etc. Those classics also made me feel empowered, as if my character really was a legendary hero in their universe. I haven't felt that from a game in years. I feel it from Dragon's Crown. Bravo to Vanillaware for that! I also have to give credit to them for creating a fascinating universe to play through. Even if the main tale isn't particularly ground-breaking, the world of DC is incredibly well realized from a story perspective. There are roughly 50 side-quests to undertake in the game, and doing so unlocks a new, gorgeous piece of art, as well as an awesome page's worth of lore to read connected with the art. These pieces of art and lore are incredibly engaging. I found myself completing all side quests just to read new info on the fascinating universe of DC.Of course, I wouldn't be so caught up in the story of DC if the universe of the game wasn't so magical in its presentation, and it definitely is here. This game is so beautiful! Of course, this shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone familiar with VW. George Kamitani and the rest of VW's past works are filled to the brim with the kind of brilliant art design and execution that leaves your imagination afire and your heart captivated. Whereas Odin Sphere had a whimsical fairy tale look, and Muramasa opted for a mythological Japanese focus, Dragon's Crown is all about high fantasy. There's a sense of whimsy to it, but there are much more down-n-dirty and epic aspects overall. There's a huge variety to the locales you visit too. From traditionally Tolkien-esque fantasy towns, castles, forests, etc. to locales that feel more at home in ancient Greek and Roman mythological and historical settings, and even some inspired by Scriptures. Every place you visit just sucks you into the world of DC, making it breathe with life and magic. The characters are equally superb visually, both in design and animation quality. There's tons of variety as well, from the positively godlike physique of the dwarf, to the swift, slender build of the elf, all playable characters have a very distinct style and design (to the ire of some overly sensitive circles). Same goes for the enemy and boss designs which are, according to VW tradition, absolutely breathtaking. Same goes for the food dishes in the game that appear during campfire cooking segments. There are few developers who understand focus on art design does much more for a game visually and is far more timeless than trying to push the boundaries of ever-aging tech like VW does. They deserve applause for that.Sound design is also quite fantastic. Just as with the visuals, everything is saturated with a fantastic fantasy motif. As I said earlier, the narrator does the majority of speaking in the game, and the actor who plays him did a fantastic job breathing life into the game's story. For $2 you can also purchase DLC that allows each main playable character to act as narrator, which is awesome. All of them do a great job as well. The real highlight with the sound, however, is the music. Hitoshi Sakimoto hit it out of the park. From the quieter moments, such as sitting at the tavern to level up and navigating the beautiful home town at Hydeland, to the intense events, such as fighting a massive red dragon across the halls of a long-abandoned capital city built into a mountainside, this game's soundtrack is simply wonderful. Overall, the sound design is superb.The real meat-n-potatoes of the game, and the obvious focus during development, is the gameplay. George Kamitani stated prior to release that he wanted to take the classic beat-em-up genre to new heights, and I'd say he definitely succeeded here. There are six playable archetypes you can choose from. There's the Amazon, the Fighter, the Elf, the Wizard, the Sorceress, and my personal favorite, the Dwarf. All have immensely different play styles that make each one a very unique experience. The Dwarf is an incredibly strong brawler who has the unique ability to pick up and throw enemies to devastating effect, the Fighter is as straightforward as his name implies, and the Amazon favors tricky parries and a beserker style that rewards risk taking. On the other hand, the Elf is a much more strategic type class, with a strike and evade style that is deadly, and the Wizard and Sorceress classes are both magic users, with the former being more offensively capable and the latter being more of a supportive class. Each character offers a vastly different experience as you play. Not only are their move sets totally different, but each comes with a de facto difficulty setting, as some are more challenging to master than others. All are incredibly fun, especially when you can play with others in multiplayer. Fighting hoards of enemies, discovering secrets in the levels, as well as engaging awesome bosses, has never been more fun. It only gets better in multiplayer, both online and off.There are also RPG elements that are brilliantly implemented. There's a skill point system tied to RPG elements and undertaking side quests that really engages you with the development of your character. New skills/abilities/passive traits open up at an excellent pace as you level up, so you always feel like your character is getting new, fresh moves to play with. Sometimes, leveling up skills does much more than just increase their damage, adding new excitement to seeing what will happen with skills you already liked. Of course, as is the main draw of most RPG-hybrid games like this, acquiring new and better loot is an addicting highlight. Add in other strategic elements such as item degradation, item management, an appraisal system for all loot, being able to find bones to resurrect into allies you can recruit, etc., and the result is a game that is as mentally engaging as it is viscerally satisfying. As always, VW's attempt to build onto an established action genre with new and exciting RPG elements is a smashing success.There are some miscellaneous aspects of the game I have to praise VW for. First off, the online multiplayer in this game is, for the most part, superb. As I mentioned previously, you can find the bones of other \"heroes\" throughout the levels and, for a small fee, you can resurrect and recruit them to come along with you on your journeys if you select them to. These AI controlled characters are perfectly adequate, but if you have it connected to the net, other players will seamlessly jump in and replace NPC players. Some levels branch off to different paths with different bosses. Rather than a democratic system, you can pick whichever path you want and all the players that opted for the other path will still have their characters join you, only this time as NPCs. There are so many thoughtful design choices that went into the online multiplayer in this game, and it works very smoothly, for the most part. I also have to praise VW for the fact that they have continued to support this game immensely after launch. They have used patches to not only fix bugs and issues, but also to add, FOR FREE, the kind of substantial content most other companies would charge you money for as DLC. That. Is. Awesome. After a patch, DC has cross-play functionality, so if your friend only owns the Vita version and you only have PS3, you can still play together. The game allows you to upload your save file to a server so that you can continue your adventures on the go with thethe PS Vita version, if you have it (I do, and this feature is great!).Speaking of which, you may wonder which version of DC is the one to get, and that's a valid question. As it turns out, there is no clear winner. The game is equally great on either system, with each version having their own strengths. The PS3 version is best if you want to be able to enjoy the art design to its fullest detail, and it's better for multiplayer to have a bigger screen. On the other hand, the Vita version features excellent touch controls that easily outclass the PS3 version, which utilizes a very clunky, uncomfortable, pain in the @$$ cursor with the right analog stick. Being able to play a game like this on the go is also a major plus in the Vita version's favor. However, the smaller Vita screen does make it easy to lose track of what's happening and where your character is among all the mayhem. The Vita version also suffers from a bit of slowdown when the action is particularly intense, whereas I haven't noticed any on the PS3. Even so, the Vita version doesn't suffer too badly from this, but it is worth mentioning. Like I said, I own both versions and I love them both equally for different reasons. Really, the only complaint I can think of for the game is that it's not cross-buy. If you want both versions, you've got to plunk down the cash for both, which can be seen as a negative. Personally, it doesn't bother me too much. At the end of the day, it's still a great game no matter which version you go with.I knew I was going to enjoy Dragon's Crown, but I've been genuinely surprised at just how much I LOVE this game. I've played it for well over 50 hours. I have leveled my Dwarf beyond the old 99 limit and beating the three difficulties (the final patch increased the level cap to 255 as well as added a fourth difficulty), finished every story event and side-quest, unlocked every piece of art, and I have no intentions of stopping there. I fully intend on beating the game on at least normal difficulty with each character class. This may be the very first game I platinum. It is just so special. VW has truly blown my expectations out of the water and delivered much more than just a pretty beat-em-up diversion. They have delivered an entry that has revitalized a classic genre (one that had been growing stale and tired until now) and elevated it to new heights. They also happened to release one of the most beautiful games of its generation, with a thrilling new universe that delivers nostalgia and fresh excitement in equal measure. I really cannot praise this game enough. If you're a fan of classical, epic high fantasy, artistic games that leave you stunned by their design, action games that have intelligent RPG designs, or just addictive beat-em-ups to play alone or with friends, then Dragon's Crown is the game for you. Buy it, prepare yourself for a rousing adventure, and enjoy reveling in what it feels like to be a hero of legend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Markus Egger \"www.MarkusEgger.com/blog\"","summary":"Best Music Game So Far","reviewText":"This is the best music game out there. Preiod. I have played all the Guitar Hero games as well as some other rythm games, and this is by far the most fun.However, there are a few points of criticism:For one, I had problems with the guitar controller. The strum bar broke pretty much as soon as I got the guitar, and I had to sign up for a replacement (which is yet to arrive). The process was simple, but still. This apparently is a problem a lot of people have, so that's disappointing.Update: I received the replacement controller today, but they sent me a PS3 controller, which is useless to me. I checked my support request and I clearly requested the 360 version. So the saga continues. Argh!!!Anyway: I like the guitar controller itself. Better even than any of the Guitar Hero controllers. It is a little bigger and heavier and it feels more like a real guitar. The \"solo buttons\" are cool too. The only thing that is not so cool is that the strum bar (even when it worked) didn't feel as good as the one on the Guitar Hero controller, since there doesn't seem to be a real noticable \"click\".Another thing that struck me as odd is that the product ships with one guitar, a drum set, and a microphone. However, the game is made for lead-guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. So you end up one guitar short. And the guitar controller isn't available for purchase separately? WTF?!?Note: The Guitar Hero controller works with this game too, except that there are no \"solo buttons\" on the GH controller. But at least it gives you a second guitar, which works well as a bass guitar.But anyway: Overall, I am having a blast with this game, so I am still giving it 5 stars. The songs are pretty good, and the selection of additional songs you can download (for a price) is extensive. The list of songs still doesn't quite hit the nail on the head as far as my personal taste is concerned (or what I would like to play in a game like this), but that is just a matter of personal preference. (I like Guitar Hero 3's selection better).The drums are also cool to play. They are probably the hardest part of the game, so that even gives veterans something new to do. Plus there always is the singing thing, if you do not mind getting emberassed. ;-)The visual style of the game is superior to Guitar Hero's comic style (IMO). Not that it seems to matter much in a game like this, but I guess it is important to some people.Update: I got this game for christmas. It is now early April. I still have not been able to get a working controller from EA. They sent me a Playstation one by accident, and then they sent me another broken xbox one. And in between, they even charged my credit card. That is just unacceptable!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2008"}

I usually like to run thru them a couple of time to be sure I have the moves down before I get into the game itself. It present, I've had a bit of trouble getting the moves down. (User problems not game I think.),  but I like the graphics and the controls seem to work well.

I sort of felt that even though the training item was all about running here and there, I would really get a chance to \"look around a bit\" once I really got into the game. Well, that's not the case. I've finished a bit of the game and all you seem to do is run from the \"blues\" and wonder where to go next to keep running. I found some of the jumps, even in easy mode, very hard to figure out. (In fact, I fell something like 50+ times trying to jump from one platform to another in the first episode. No fun for me!) The game does have a \"hint\" feature that's meant to be helpful, but sometimes you don't get the time to figure out what it's trying to tell you before the \"blues\" catch up to you and shoot you dead, (Over and Over and Over again until you figure out what to do!) You don't get the time to check out the area, in most cases at all, before your pushed to \"run for it\" or the \"blues\" will get you. I get that the idea of the game is to run to get away from pursuit, but even that kind of the game gives the player a chance to stop every once in a while and explore the surroundings. I did note one thing that was a bit helpful. While your \"running\", there are items that you can interact with along the path which are colored a reddish orange. That was helpful, but on more than one occasion I didn't get to \"use\" them as I only spotted them after running by them and from another view point. All in all, at this point, the game has been more frustrating than fun to play. We'll see......","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"B. Convery","summary":"Wha?  What?  Was that a woman crying?!?","reviewText":"Single Player*:Doom 3 is avant garde in the sound and lighting department.  The strange sounds you hear bouncing along the piped walls seem to get more frequent the more time you take.  You have no idea if they are in the distance, if they are right in front hiding in some unlit place.  Hell, you hear them.  A rattling corpes falls , dangling from the ceiling, it was this the rattling noise, nothing more, nothing less.  Next noise and you might not be so lucky, cause the service lights of the complex just went out.  Should you hold your favorite artillery in the dark or hold your flashlight to see your way through?  Balance it out, perhaps, switching mindlessly between light source and twitching trigger finger.This is Doom 3 and it's a perfect upgrade of what I'd expect the Doom 2 classic to be today.  The graphics and mood are built with as much realism I've ever seen in a game.  Things pop out from dark corners and lunge through opened doors, making you jump back more than once.The controls in the game utilize the XBox R-type controller perfectly.  The D-pad allows you to assign direction (^V&lt;>) to your favorite lead/plasma/rocket/soul stocked wrist cronies.  This allows for quick access.  The concept of quick access is driven further with the incessant need to switch flashlight/artillery.The single player story is told through dead people's PDAs.  Pick em up (they're not using 'em anymore) and find access codes and tales of their experiences in their UAC Depts.  It's an interesting way of telling a story that's been told before.  I enjoyed this medium.Online Co-Op*:This is a great addition to the game, one that any XBliver will be very happy to have.  Grab a buddy and go through the game together.  I haven't solved the game in this mode, but the levels for Online Co-Op seem to be a little fewer and/or peared down from the single player game.  It's a fun experience especially with a friend.In closing, Doom 3 is a great dark masterpiece.  It's very reminiscent of the old Doom games you remember from PC, seeing upgrades of your enemies and all that.  You'll also remember that the enemies will come right at you, head-on, in a rather dumb sort of fashion, meaning they lack state of the art AI.  That's a reason I chainsawed a star away from being a 5 star title.  Don't expect flanking or running and hiding on the vermin's part.  They come right at you.  Many times this makes you jump back.*The reason I structured this way is because I found the Single Player game the best experience of Doom 3.  Don't cheat.  Single Player meaning no spectators in the room and lights out.  Stereo sound if you have it.  The game is less atmospheric if you are talking to someone in the room or joking with your XBox live buddy at how fat his ex-girfriend is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2005"}

I was surprised when it was announced that Uncharted 3 would be coming out so soon after the last one. I just completed the game and frankly, I think it could have used more time.First of all, I experienced some bad glitches. Early on in the game, Drake just fell through the floor. He fell completely out of the game and died. In another instance I was trying to get him to climb up a wall. Instead, he phased through the wall, flew up to the ceiling and fell back to the floor. Then there are instances where Drake just gets stuck in the environment. There is one gun battle where you're standing on a boat that has some stairs. I can't tell you how many times I died because Drake would get stuck on the stairs and wouldn't move. Also, there are many times in the game where you have to play alongside other characters. They routinely get in your way and block your movement. Normally, I can look past these kinds of glitches but after playing Uncharted 2, I expect more from Naughty Dog. They set the bar high for themselves and I don't think they matched it.Then there is the story. It just didn't have the impact that Uncharted 2 did. It wasn't until half the game was over that I felt Uncharted 3 really got going. In Uncharted 2, I was immersed in the game from the opening sequence. The villains are forgettable and there are only a couple of action scenes that will last in your memory.Then there are the puzzles... They're bad. If you don't know what to do, Drake or one of the characters will just tell you. OR the game will tell you what to do. It used to be that the player would have to figure out puzzles for themselves in games. Not anymore. Naughty Dog needs to stop stringing together endless gun battles and focus more on creating some good puzzles.The graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is top notch though. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaimun","summary":"The Best Uncharted Experience","reviewText":"I bought Uncharted 3 on release date and I have to say this is most complete Uncharted experience. I played the first two games in the installment after I played this one to understand the story. I am going to break my review up into a few parts.Gameplay: Uncharted 3 is a 3rd person shooter/action adventure game by heart. You are in 3rd person unless you aim and you move around and climb things, solve puzzles, etc.. The game is much more fluid than its predecessors in terms of movement, targeting, climbing, covering, and jumping. I do not find the controls frustrating at all.Campaign: You should expect at the least some Indiana Jones/Mission Impossible hybrid type of action movie. There are many parts of the campaign that other games just don't provide. It feels like a movie, there's character development, Drake's origins are explained. I mean, How can you go wrong? Although, Uncharted 2's campaign was a little better, U3's campaign still delivers.Co-op & Multiplayer: Aside from the campaign, you have a multiplayer mode which you can access online. There are many different types of game you can partake in. You also have the incentive to obtain medals for specific actions and level up. You obtain money from playing matches and you are able to use the money to buy character skins, Weapon load-outs/upgrades, boosters, and medal kickbacks. Boosters allow you to have different perks that you can use and medal kickbacks are what you can use after you obtain a certain number of medals in a match.You can play Co-op adventure with anyone online, basically its a non-canon campaign storyline that you play with some of the Uncharted characters. There is another mode called Co-op Hunter Arena. You basically play a small sandbox maps doing different objectives while taking enemies out with other people online. Unfortunately co-op only allows 2-3 players on each stage.There is a lot to do in Multiplayer. I find it very fun and I play it daily. It keeps me busy from buying other games. It takes a lot of time to level up, obtain medals, treasures (They unlock things like weapons for load-outs), and money.The max is 10 players on one stage. 6 for Three team deathmatch. Naughty Dog is provide DLC for Multiplayer as well. So far, 6 DLCs were released. Is it worth it for the new maps, skins, co-op adventure, etc..? YES IT IS!! You can buy the Uncharted 3 Fortune Hunters Club which is available on PSN which will save you 60% of the total DLC. You will be able to Download the future DLC when they are released for free. I say it's worth it.Replayability: Where do I start? From collecting all the treasures in Campaign, trying to beat the game on Crushing Mode(trust me, it's not a walk in the park),and playing the multiplayer mode. There is a lot to do.Uncharted is just in my opinion, the most satisfying exclusive for Sony.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004EW948E","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Here is the most underrated game of this generation","reviewText":"Binary Domain certainly has its faults (the dreadful cover art is definitely one of them), but it feels more original than many games I've played. I'm honestly not a huge Third Person Shooter fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed Binary Domain. With many TPS the controls feel clunky, but Binary Domain's controls feel quick, fluid, and natural.The gameplay is rock solid. The sound of metal on metal as your rounds splinter off android armor is satisfying. Annoyed that some video games take half a dozen shots to take down a human enemy? Well in this game every bullet counts as you'll peel off enemy android armor depending on where you place your shots. You also get more money for head shots, type of enemy, etc. in which you can use to buy upgrades. The battling never gets old. There are plenty of boss battles, quicktime events, etc. that keep the game varied.A thrilling story that initially seems bland like most games, but as it progresses it propels into one that Sci-Fi greats like Isaac Asimov would appreciate. The setting/environments are definitely above average. The entire atmosphere of the game is one that adds to its quality. One thing this game does exceptionally well is the banter between the squad mates during gameplay. They are continuously chatting making it actually feel like you are in a squad instead of playing a videogame with AI teammates.There are a few issues. One is the commands. Some responses just simply don't make sense. Additionally, some of the lines your squad uses was insanely repetitive (more prevalent in the beginning) that happens so often in videogames. Sometimes your squad mates feel completely useless. Next, the boss battles are frustrating. You'll be on the ground for most of them as it is way too easy to get knocked down and your health depletes far too quickly.The singleplayer is one of the best campaigns I've played in awhile. I haven't tried the multiplayer but so far I've heard that this isn't a game that it's known for. Overall, it is a solid value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

Horrible voice acting.","reviewText":"This game includes all of the events in the third movie of the trilogy. It can be played in co-op mode Which is one of the reasons I love it so much, the battles are many.You'll battle orcs, undead soldiers Haradim in some ugly looking underwear, giant elephants, Nazgul, you name it. This combines hack and slash with several games of strategy. The final boss is pathetic and lame but that's made up for by the game's challenging nature.There are a few things that bugged me though, namely the fact that you only get one life each and some of the enemies are quite literally unkillable.  For a game and movie this epic you're gonna need WAY more than one life  each but sadly there's no way to remedy this. Most of the complex and kill instantly type of moves can't be performed without getting hit and taking major damage. I barely managed to beat this game on easy mode but it's super fun to play with a friend. You can  only play as a limited number of characters unless you  beat the game or use cheat codes.The second thing that bugged me was the inbcredibly lame voice acting. Some of the voices sound original but I literally cringed at the line \"not asleep. Dead.\" I don't whether the VA had a frog caught in his throat along with some nails and really tart lemonade but it sounded like a person with a severe speech impediment. I couldn't let this slide.As for content, the spiders have hardly visible guts but otherr than that there is no blood whatsoever.  There is no cursing or anything of that sort. I think the T rating comes from the constant presence of violence in battle. It's hazrdly imitatable.  Over all if you like bloodless battle games with a bit of strategy included, buy this game you'll enjoy it.  I reccomend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2012"}

They both do the same chessy move over and over and over and over again, and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you try to do a move, the computer's apparant pshychic ability counters your move before you even do it; very lame programming.  They also added a throw to Shao Khan's already cheesy arsenal which makes him even more cheap. This game is better when playing other human players, ...  It takes more luck than skill to beat this game.  Another drawback is the slow loading times on Playstation.  ...

More detail, more objects with more polys and better textures than either Soul Reaver 2 or Blood Omen 2. Soul Reaver 2 I consider the best game I have ever played on the Playstation- and I was hoping that Defiance would carry the quality of story and unforgettable voice acting to the next level, and while Michael Bell and Simon Templeton (Raziel and Kain's voice actors), are clearly at the top of their form, Crystal Dynamics decided to scale back the story in favor of more action. I had mixed feelings about that because it sounded as though they were dumbing down the franchise in favor of more glitz. They haven't- the revamped combat system includes several new maneuvers and special abilities that really go a long way to making Defiance is a more exciting experience and I'm betting many fans of the older games might like the fact that the 10 minute cut scenes with all their flowery dialog are gone.To be sure the story is deep as it carries on after the events in SR2- 500 years after and begins with Kain infiltrating the Sarafan stronghold to confront Moebius while Raziel has spent the past five centuries in the underworld. Raziel has discovered that his destiny is to be the spirit that will inhabit the Soul Reaver blade and this understandably has him a little upset. The core theme of Defiance is simply that- the exertion of free will over fate. Kain believes that no one except perhaps Raziel has free will and is moving through events to find him as well as his own answers. Raziel is in the unique position of being outside the rules in some instances to the point of  being able to avoid the scrutiny of the Time Streamer, Moebius. This enables Raziel to journey about Nosgoth with some freedom- exploring the world and learning more and more about his past and perhaps find a clue as to how to avoid his terrible fate.One of the interesting aspects of the game, aside from switching between Kain and Raziel from chapter to chapter, is they are visiting the same places and essentially looking for the same answers, separated by 500 years and together they assemble the story for the player. The downside to this is you essentially are doing the same things twice in some cases, even to the point where Raziel must reforge the Reaver as he did in SR2. Fortunately, these missions seem secondary and are quite a bit easier than they were in SR2, taking little time to accomplish. In the reforging of the blade they made each new enhancement permanent and Raziel can switch between the elemental enhancements as the player sees fit rather than having to find the correct elemental font to reimbue the blade with the energy type needed. Kain also enhances that physical Reaver- new powers abound for both characters such as invisibility, a dimensional attack that allows Kain to execute attacks on several targets at once, and the awesome improvement they made to each characters telekinesis- allowing either Kain or Raziel to fling opponents into walls or off cliffs with a quick snap of a O button. Multiple successive attacks on foes also charges each Reaver allowing Kain or Raziel to crack off additional spells. Both characters are much tougher than their previous incarnations.Raziel perhaps goes through the most changes- he no longer re-enters the physical world using the swirling dimensional gates, instead he must find an area in the spectral realm where a body is buried. Raziel shifts, inhabiting the corps which he then discards, assuming his normal blue bad-ass form. Additionally, he no longer seems to regenerate slowly in the Spectral Realm, plus his ability to devour souls is no longer at odds with the Reaver's hunger. He can feed and thereby sustain himself much easier than he could in SR2. He can feed the Reaver, but instead of just absorbing the soul, the Reaver is charged faster enabling him to cast spells. Both Kain and Raziel can also dodge foes like never before- executing tumbles, leaps, somersaults and quick shifts to mist form to avoid attacks.Graphically, Defiance is one big piece of eye candy- areas are huge and very well detailed- colors and textures are very lavish- things like fog, smoke and light effects are used sparingly and to great effect with the `less is more' philosophy. As I said, graphics are very much improved over the older games and the PS2 handles most of them quite well and I only noticed one segment (Kain's battle with Sarafan on the draw bridges), where there was a noticeable drop in frame rate. Music is also first rate and is best described as `funky gothic'- lots of drums and low buzzing synthesizer tunes, whispers and metallic clanks that combine to give the music a very original and unusual feel. Sound effects are unusual and often creepy, especially during Raziel's stints in the Spectral Realm- disembodied voices, screams, crying- very well used in all instances.If I have any complaints, it would be choice of camera positions. In SR2, in fact most of the Legacy of Kain games, the camera was squarely over the character's shoulder, in Defiance the camera is unbound, and positioning seems to be based on where the character is in the level. While this adds a neat cinematic feel to the action, it makes certain leaps and jumps difficult because often you can't see where you're jumping to. I noticed this especially in Raziel's first mission when he has to escape from the Elder God in the Spectral Realm- I must have attempted two of the last jumps 20 times each before I got it just right. Second, Kain's objectives seem a little more vague than Raziel's, at least to me. It's balanced out by the fact that the player spends more time as Raziel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}

You take control of Lightning and you hear about l'cie and pulse l'cies and you are pretty confused and don't know what's going on. As you get into it however, there is deep character building. You will soon learn to understand Lightning and create a bond with the rest of the cast. While the storyline itself is confusing and most will be baffled by it, the character building is really good. The soundtrack is also very good. The music is made in a way where you will think it's \"pretty\" and \"sets the tone\" of emotions. The graphics are excellent and top notch, no complaints. All in all, this is a good game, but not as good as older final fantasies. If you are put off by the linearity, the sequel fixes that issue. If you are looking for a solid rpg with amazing graphics and soundtrack, this ones great. This game gets heavy criticism for not living up to the other final fantasies which are highly revered, and deservedly so, but if you pass up on this one it's a sad thing, as i feel this is a good game, and if you have the time and patience its a rewarding line.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Prometheus \"diosprometheus\"","summary":"Freezes on XBox360","reviewText":"This game might work okay on XBox, but it freezes up on XBox 360 when battling Bad Bessie even though it is supposed to be compatible.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Good single player, excellent multiplayer","reviewText":"I know my review will have a lot of people \"disagreeing\" with me.  I'm waiting for my counter to show that.  But I just can't give this game the glowing reviews professional game sites and other reviewers have been giving it.Microsoft is good at advertising and building hype.  When Halo 2 was released, millions of fans were at the exploding point of anticipation waiting for it to be released.  I was one of the crazies waiting in line until midnight in the cold and snow.  I'm not just a casual gamer who had a mild interest in Halo 2.  I was anticipating it with more ferver than any game (except Resident Evil 4) coming out recently.IMO--The bottom line: The game is good.  If you own an xbox and like FPSs then you should at least rent it.  If you own an xbox, love FPSs and have Xbox Live then what are you waiting for?  Buy it, already!The single player game is fun.  It's not what I expected.  Defying expectations can be good or bad.  But when you say in all of your ads that it's time to save earth, you're going to play on earth, earth doesn't need a hero it needs a savior, then you better have the game take place on earth.  MINOR SPOILER: So when I beat the second mission I was ready to go to.....another Halo?  Um...ok, we're following the Covenant, so I'll go with it, but we're going back to Earth right?  ...no?  Oh.  Um, ok.  So who is this Savior saving Earth?I know I'm being sarcastic and people can argue that by going to a different Halo we were saving Earth in the process...but I think a lot of people wanted to fight on earth.  After the demo at E3, people were salivating for the war-zone battles that it presented and hinted at.  Ironically that scene never happens in the game.  The city where it takes place in is, but not the scenario.  I never felt that excitement that was shown in that video.  The video promised a war zone like game, armies totally duking it out for their very survival.  Instead, we got another Halo planet to go to.I also don't think the story was as cohesive as the first one and lacked the dramatic pacing of it.  It didn't have the driving force the first one did.  I often wondered why I was doing what I was doing.  Even though I enjoyed it (another spoiler) I think playing as the Covenant hurt the plot pacing.  I'm hoping the third Halo will be more climatic with a better pacing to it.The graphics are beautiful.  There are some clipping and aliasing issues.  However, the reason for it is because you have a seamless game.  After the original load, there is not a single load time throughout the entire game.  You go from mission to mission without realizing it, unlike the first game that loaded each mission.  I was really amazed by that.But the single player is not even half of the game, IMO.  The best part is the Live experience.  Halo 2 has the most cohesive online experience I have played on PC or on console.  It's real easy to find different people to play, and people who are at or around your level.  Even later in this game's life, if a new person buys it they shouldn't have much problems getting into the Live experience.  For example, in Half Life 2, the updated Counter Strike is offered.  However, it's been my experience with that, that if you haven't played the original don't even bother because people will pwn you.  I think this rating system for Halo 2 will help extend it's life not only by allowing new people to slip in with ease but it also gives veterans something to work for.  That \"level 50\" is always there, urging you onward.One complaint about the Live experience is people dropping out of a match because they didn't like the level or settings, etc.  This happens often.  People also drop out if they are losing.  I'm glad it hurts the people's standing because dropping out automatically ranks you last in the mission, but it can cause frustrations when you have a team of 1 or 2 going up against 4 in capture the flag.But, gripes aside, the Live portion is simply awesome and really pushes the game into the must own category.  If they had just released the single player part, I would have been greatly disappointed.Single player:  4-----I would love to give it a 4.5 or a 5, but I can't when there are better single player games out there...and no game is perfect.Online: 5-----As far as lasting value, if you like it, you will play it forever.  I lose track of time playing this.Total:  4.5-----Great game if you have Live.  If you don't and don't have many friends nearby who own an xbox to do split screen or system link, I would definitely rent it or possibly buy it.  If you have Live, buy it now.  You won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"dora\"","summary":"Close to platforming nirvanna.","reviewText":"I'm a purist.  I am hard pressed to believe that taking the platforming genre and moving it into a 3D environment is a good idea.  However, I well and thoroughly enjoy this game.Ratchet and Clank, IIRC, shares a game engine with Jak & Daxter, but I find R&C; far more enjoyable.  This is in part due to the multitude of weapons available, some with strange and arcane effects (like the suck cannon which sucks in enemies which you can fire out later, or the morph gun which turns enemies into chickens).It's also in part due to the clever level design.  There are usually a couple of ways to get to a certain area, and I never found any area exceedingly difficult to clear (not that it was easy, mind).  The only complaint I have is that there are often \"tracks\" through a level which can be very obvious and sort of break the mood.The graphics are great.  The style fits the mood of the game perfectly, everything is generally very crisply rendered, and I can only recall one or two times where the framerate really chugged.  And that was in a heated battle using a gun with lots of special effects on a horde of enemies.The reason this title doesn't get four stars overall is because there isn't a whole lot of mission variety, and that can get annoying after a couple of hours of game time.  Still, it's an awfully fun platformer which is executed very well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2004"}

If you are familiar with the Yakuza series, you should know that Dead Souls is quite the departure. Firstly, there are zombies. And not just zombies, but a crap ton of zombies. I must have slaughtered hundreds in the first hour alone. Secondly, melee combat has been removed, and replaced with an awkward, but strangely enjoyable 3rd person shooting mechanic. These controls take some getting used to, but grow on you over time. Aiming has an auto assist function, that makes head shots quite fun to pull off.

I had even more doubts when I found out that Tidus was absent from the game and Yuna had taken over as the main character.  I bought the game anyway and decided to give it a chance.  Here's what I thought:This game ties in so much with the origanal FFX.  Trust me, if you didn't play the original FFX all the way through then you'll be lost in this game.  It's amazing how Sqare made the events from FFX tie into this game so much.Now for the battle system.  As you already know, the battle system changes on each Final Fantasy game.  On this one the characters use dresspheres (jobs) and they can change jobs during the battle.  The combat is non-linear, which means multiple characters can attack all at once to increase damage.  There's no more attack-be attacked-attack patterns.  Another huge difference is the absence of aeons (remember they were destroyed at the end of FFX).  Believe me, once you get into the game you won't mind there not being any aeons.  The ATB system has also been brought back to FFX-2.As for the storyline I have to honestly say that it's incredible.  Almost as good as FF8 and FF7.  Yuna becomes a sphere hunter and on a journey to find Tidus.  The great thing about the story of this game is that so many different things can happen depending on what decisions you make.  In Chapter 2 of the game you will make a decision that will determine most of the events to occur in the rest of the game.  There's also a completion percentage in the game and you can view various endings depending on how much of the game you completed.As for the sound, it's slightly above average.  It's not as good as FF7-10 but it's not nearly as horrible as FFTA.  Some of the tunes are nice while others are annoying.The replayability of this game is one of its biggest assets.  This game is designed so that different events occur depending on the decisions you make.  You can play the game more than once to experience different outcomes.  This game also lets you start a &quot;New Game Plus&quot;.  This means that you can carry over the items, gil, accesories, dresspheres, abilities, etc. that you had in your first game.  Oh yeah your levels don't carry over to your new game, so don't think you're going to get god-like characters that easily.  I've beaten it once and I'm definitely playing it again to get all the things I missed in my first game.The sidequests/mini-games in FFX-2 are immense.  This game has more mini-games than ANY other FF title before.  That adds a lot to the overall plot of the game and this game has a challenging 100-floor dungeon called Via Infinito for veteran FF players.  Believe me this place IS A REAL CHALLENGE.  I still have yet to beat it.  There's so many various rewards and great accesories to be acquired by doing the sidequests.Overall this is a great game.  I saw some of the other 1 sentence reviews where people said this game sucks because Tidus isn't here.  You can tell that they obviously haven't played the game and show their ignorance with those simple-minded reviews.  I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPG games.  Also you need to play FFX if you haven't already or else you'll be confused with this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2004"}

New career mode with Go Pro theme compliments the same elements that have made THPS a phenomenon.  Claw your way up through the amateur ranks to prove yourself in the professional world of skateboarding.","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Best Hawk Game Yet","reviewText":"In each of its four Tony Hawk titles, Activision has brought something new and innovative to skateboard games. Like many others, I was wondering what this company that revolutionized skateboarding video games could bring to a fourth title. There are three things I have to say about this game that make it such an awesome game.First, although the gameplay and controls of THPS4 are the same as the previous game, you will notice a change in the format of the game right away. Instead of starting a level with two minutes on the clock to complete as many goals as possible, you start the level with no time limit. You can skate around freely, collecting cash, loooking for gaps and cool places to skate and when you feel like completing some goals you simply skate up to a person with an arrow above their head. They will give you a goal and a time limit. You will find that this format of gameplay really gives you a lot more freedom.Second, the creativity of this game is just amazing. There are mini-games hidden in some of the levels that allow you to earn extra cash. Some of the goals were so crazy they left me staring at the television in awe of the coolness of the game. Also, you are now forced to perfect every type of trick in the book. There are many goals that force you to use a certain type of trick. For example, there is one competition where you are placed on a floor with no ramps to do tricks off of or rails to grind. Your entire run will consist of manuals.Third, the amount of gameplay in this game exceeds any of the previous games by a great deal. THPS3 was short and simple. Once you get the game down, you can beat it in less than an hour. The gameplay hours were extended by being required to beat the game with all 21 skaters in order to unlock everything available. THPS4 is much longer. There are 190 goals total, some of which are insanely difficult. And you don't have to go through the monotony of beating the game with every skater. As you progress through the game with one skater, you progress with them all.These are the three things that really make THPS4 stand out as the best skateboarding game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2002"}

Batman Arkham City is basically Arkham Asylum in a sand box setting. It is a great idea but it did not maintain the impact that Arkham Asylum had. The objectives just didn't connect well together for a complete goal. I felt I was wondering from one objective to the next without a real sense of purpose. Everything I did felt like a gimmick to connect me to the next supervillain fight. Also, you start with most of your gadgets from the beginning of the game. Normally this would be a good feature but you do not get many new gadgets throughout the game. There isn't a slow build up of feeling increasingly more powerful. The length is also an issue. I was expecting a lengthy campaign since it was touted in pretty much every review I read but I finished all of the side missions I could find (minus the riddler trophies)and the main story in around the same time as I finished Arkham Asylum. YOU CAN RENT THIS GAME AND COMPLETE ALMOST EVERYTHING IT HAS TO OFFER unless you want to count the New Game+ feature.

Both setups require multiple remote controls for different devices, so I bought this new-and-improved PS3 remote and see if it can help with reducing number of remotes I have.First the feel. It has more curves on the back and feels really good to hold. The cursor ring with \"Enter\" button in the center has little bit of edge sticking up for up/down/left/right, which helps the thumb to sense each of the direction. I really liked this usability enhancement!  Netflix and blu-ray movie operations are definitely better in the dark with this.Now for the added features to support TVs and AMPs. It's a mixed bag. On my LG TV, it's supported and it's nice to be able to turn the TV on/off and change volume on the same controller. It does recognize the \"input\" and menu control for the LG HDTV, which is cool. However we use AT&T; U-Verse receiver, and so it's not possible to change channels. Anyone with cable or satellite receivers will not be able to control it.As for the AMP/receiver, the only supported receivers are Sony!  I have a Yamaha on the other PS3 setup, and so it's totally useless. I wonder is Sony purposely doing this (I wouldn't be surprised), or just didn't get to supporting other brands.  So if you have a PS3 in a home theater setup using a none Sony receiver, you'll still need another remote control for on/off, volumes, input, etc.So all in all, for the price under $20, it's a good step up from the previous PS3 remote control. The ability to use less remotes depends on whether you have a supported TV, and a Sony receiver!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"David G. Harpstrite","summary":"A Masterpiece","reviewText":"The Witcher 2 is without a doubt one of the best games to come out last year for the PC. So how does the console version, released almost a year later, fare? Very well I'm happy to report. The Witcher 2 is a gripping RPG set in a very gritty and dark world. There are only shades of grey and the choices you have to make never have a clear right or wrong answer. You play Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster hunter. Witchers are kind of like mutants from Xmen in that they posses unnatural abilities and are feared and hated across the land. Gearalt is framed for the murder of a king and must track down the real killer, who is a witcher like himself. In doing so you are embroiled in several political conflicts, wars, and the occasional romp with a fare wench. This game is clearly for adults, not just because there is a lot of blood and nudity, though that's more than present. I wouldn't buy this game for anybody under the age of 17. It is very deserving of the M rating it has. The game's story is complex and not something easily understood. It expects you to pay attention. The characters are interesting, well written and have realistic motivations. The world is great too, it really feels like a fantasy world while retaining sense of realism. This place feels real, it's not just some random fantasy world somebody created. As such the choices you make have serious implications. The game can play out very differently and you will not get every quest based on those choices. It's a game you simply have to play multiple times, no question. So needless to say this game is worth checking out for the story alone. My only problem is the third act of the game feels very short, even with the added content I didn't really feel like I could just explore and do random quests like I could in the first two. Kind of felt like they were just ready to wrap the story up.  It's not that bad, but it was kind of disappointing. Also, the difficult to know what's going on at first if you haven't played the first game, and with it not being avaliable on the Xbox 360 that can be problematic. That said the game still concludes in a good way and after a little bit you kind of get caught up to speed. I still loved every minute of it this story and you should too, provided you like stories that are intelligent and complex in their design.This game plays great, but be prepared, it's somewhat difficult. The Witcher 2 takes you seriously, and as such won't pull punches. These enemies want you dead, and you can be damn sure they'll try and kill you. You have to really use your head to defeat them. You can do this by using the right spells, potions and weapons. For example, you have two swords, one steel and one silver. Steel is best used for regular opponents like humans whereas the silver sword is best for monsters and other unnatural beats. A Silver sword will not be effective against a human wearing steel plated armor or chain mail. The means of selecting spells, weapons or other offensive items is similar to the power wheel from Mass Effect, you hold the left bumper and select your preferred tactic. It can sometimes be clumsy but once you get the hang of it you'll be fine. That kind of sums up gameplay in The Witcher 2. I had a hard time at first but once I settled in and got the hang of it I loved it. The combat is rewarding and challenging. Geralt swings his sword as if it has weight, so don't expect instant hits, though you can use fast attacks with the A button, but the X button is how you really deal damage, though it's slow, so try and mix it up. The interface for menus is streamlined and works fine, though I feel it involves far too many button presses and can feel a tad convoluted, but it's not that bad. Leveling your skills is done through a skill tree with powers that level up twice and offer a wide variety of effects. Mainly though it's your typical RPG style. Combat, magic, alchemy and a training tree that is short and is just for general skills. Overall the game plays wonderfully and it's one of the best RPG's I've ever played.Graphically, I honestly can't believe this game is running on the Xbox 360. Much like Rage and Crysis 2, this game seems like it's too good looking for a console. But some how CD Project red made it work. I suspect black magic or some other means of foul sorcery. Animations are incredible, characters move fluidly. Little things make the difference to me and the amount of care and detail put into the look of this game is astonishing. It's vibrant and colorful while maintaining that gritty feel. The only issue I have with this game visually is that some texture pop in does show up to a degree of frequency, but it's a minor gripe that shouldn't bother you.The sound in this game pretty good. Sound effects are good, monsters sound ferocious, the world sounds truly alive, Voice acting is superb all around and the music is wonderful, the game comes with a soundtrack and you should give it a listen, it's good stuff.So, overall the Witcher 2 delivers in every way. It's a wonderful game and shouldn't be ignored, if you're a fan of RPG's and are over the age of 16 give it a look see, it's well worth your time. Hopefully the xbox release will give the series a wider audience and we can get the third game for the Xbox as well. This is a thoughtful port and I can't begin to tell you how much I admire CD Profect Red for their work on this game, it's truly a masterpiece and I can't recommend it enough.10 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2012"}

It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, \"How is it played?\" and I respond, \"Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!\" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.Anyhow, here's some other things:1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the \"cage match\" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.4. The \"easy mode\" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., \"Bow of Apollo,\" \"Claws of Hades\"), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted \"Bow of Apollo\" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a \"BLOOD OFF\" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven't played the first two installments.  You'll be baffled as to what's going on until at least halfway through the game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2010"}

I recently used the MadCatz Triton stereo headset (corded). It was fine, but the cord became an issue with kids running around, so I moved it upstairs to my pc/xbox area, and it works great there. The Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 was a welcome addition. Like I mentioned, my kids running around the toy/gaming room was an issue, and on a couple occasions, the Trittons were ripped from my head once the kids tripped over the cable. Ouch (for me, not the kids tripping =). These Ear Force arrived and at first glance I was confused. After reading the manual a bit, it was pretty easy to hook up. My other issue is that I have my Wireless-N Apple Router, my OOMA telephone system, my ps3, my wii, a tivo and my cable modem in the same room (most using some form of wireless). I was worried about crosstalk/jamming/freq confliction/interference, whatever you want to call it. In the details it states : 2.4/5GHZ Dual-Band Wi-Fi - Selects the optimum frequency in the 2.4GHz/5GHz spectrums, virtually eliminating interference. That was my main concern. I wasn't really worried about the quality of sound, since I was running the sound before through my old headphones or through the junky tv speakers. Once everything was hooked up, I gave it a spin. The headphones are a bit tight and comfort might be an issue. I played Skyrim first, and the sounds was impressive. I was hearing sounds that I swore I didn't hear before. Right there, a star bonus. I then tested my OOMA telephone system while the headphone unit was on. No issues on interference out of the box (phew). I then tested Gears of War 3 multiplayer, and my ping rate seemed fine, no lag, no interference on my wireless router (phew). After about an hour, I did notice a bit of an ear issue. Yes, they are tight fitting, but I believe they will eventually settle in and get better (will update review). I wasn't able to test my cellphone/bluetooth, but will try that out soon. The battery charge seemed fine after a few hours use as well, but not really worried about that since the charger is feet away. I will mess with the sound settings as well soon, but out of the box it sounds fine. Overall 4 1/2 stars just because the padding on the headset might be an issue.

However, I liked the screenshots and the vampire theme and decided to give it a chance. At least with the patch installed, I really enjoyed the game and found no significant or show-stopping bugs. It looks great, the NPC are very interesting and well developed, and the quests can be funny, dark, and quite elaborate. The game, even with the patch, does have a few technical problems as well as some other flaws.  However, if you like vampire stories and role-playing games, then Bloodlines is definitely worth a try.Gameplay: Character creation (you can be 1 of 7 types of vampires) is interesting, allowing you to customize a male or female vampire that has been recently sired.  You have several choices of abilities and skills, but character creation is not as deep as in some RPGs like Morrowind.  During the game, you earn experience points that you can use to increase certain skills, attributes, or disciplines (your vampiric powers).  This system generally works well, but don't expect to max out many of these areas by the end of the game (thus, choose your character-development path wisely).The game is rather linear in progression, although there are a number of side quests and your character is allowed to solve some quests in 2 or 3 different ways.  Movement and combat are much like typical first-person shooters, and melee weapons are much more powerful than guns (a good sword will take you through about the whole game--I like the shotgun, though). There are a few good scares in the game (such as a haunted hotel and an encounter at a park), but the developers missed a lot of great opportunities to really scare players. Overall, the story is a very good one, and you'll meet some fascinating characters (like VV, Gary, Jack) who have great dialogue.  The quests are well done and often multi-layered, but there are a few areas where things get bogged down, such as when you are trying to reach certain bosses.  You often have to go through an hour or two of encounters with their minions in order to reach them.  I have only played the game through once as a male Toreador, but I think I did about all of the side quests, in addition to the main quests.  There was only one quest in a graveyard that I found too frustrating to complete, but thankfully it was an optional side quest.Graphics: The graphics look realistic (based on the Source engine), but I didn't get good framerates walking around the 4 cities. There are some long load times between levels, which improve drastically depending on how much RAM you have (I would suggest at least 768MB).  The four cities are all very well rendered, but a bit small.  Character models look good, as do most animations, but many models are repeated.  Overall, you'll need a good video card to enjoy the game thoroughly.Sound: There is a lot of good atmosphere in this game, thanks to some good music, great voice acting, and ambient sounds.  I am not into heavy metal music, but it just seemed to fit well in this game's gothic scenes.  However, even with the patch, there are still some sound issues, especially occasional studdering (increasing my RAM seemed to improve this a bit for me). Also, the game crashed to desktop about 8 times.Replayability/Value: Overall, I am very pleased with this game. The game will last about 40 solid hours the first time through.  In my view, there is not much replay value here. While it might be interesting to try another vampire clan or the other gender, there's not much difference in how the story unfolds.  There are at least two alternate endings, but the difference is only about twenty seconds of cutscenes.  Still, if you like role-playing games, first-person shooters, and vampire stories, then I highly recommend Bloodlines.  I hope there's a sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2005"}

Oh, it's got Isaac Clark and the production design is recognizable as being Dead Space, but the feeling and the pace of the game are completely different.  Dead Space was a tense survival horror game, DS2 was more of an action thrill ride, but was tense and fun.  This game is just a slog.  The enemies rush you en mass so you frequently have to resort to melee and this is a series that has never excelled at melee.  And frankly, the boss battles seem like they wandered in from the Lost Planet games.  It's at least worth a rental or wait til the price drops.  I regret paying full price for this.EDIT 3/24/13: After putting aside the game for several months out of sheer boredom I finally picked it up again to finish it.  My original criticisms still stand.

There's Goldeneye, for the N64. This plot was kill, kill, kill, oh, and when your done could you please kill these people too? Tomorrow Never Dies, for the Playstation, seemed to never get anywhere. It was 3rd person, had sloppy control, and I couldn't make out a storyline. The World is not enough, N64 again, was probably the most amazing N64 games there. Agent under fire seems to follow in The World is not Enough's footsteps, but takes everything TWINE took to the max, and takes the max to the max... if that doesn't make any sense don't worry because it doesn't... With more gadgets, guns and girls than any other 007 game, along with the most stunning graphics out of all the 007 games, and probably the best plot among any other 007 game.When I put the CD in to play, got through the intro, and got to main screen, and selected \"Select Mission\" and pressed start, I was immediately put into a mission briefing. Q, M and Mickaloi (the gadgets wiz) will explain what to do, when to do it, and what is happening. When I pressed \"A\" and started the game, I experienced a cut-scene. It showed me in a car driving to a tower. Then, Q explained my options of entering. You can use a Q-decoder to glitch the lock on a door into opening, or use my Q-Claw to climb up the wall and drop from above. I was speechless! As I went on, the story develops, and the game gets more and more interesting. You have 3 tries to complete a level (if you die at certain milestone, you start there) until you die completely and are exited to the main screen again. The guns and gadgets are definitely more impressive. The one problem: WHERE THE HECK IS PIERCE BROSNON! The new James Bond is some weird looking guy whom has one eyebrow up 24/7 and has this ridiculous smug grin on and his accent is anything BUT British. He sounds like some guy with a French mom and an Irish dad and speaks with an Italian accent. Apart from James Bond not being Pierce, I give the gameplay a 10/10.The first thing I noticed when I turned on the game was the opening scene. If you've every seen Playstation, the opening scene is always in full 3D textures... then the game starts and the graphics, well, plain-out suck. Gamecube reverses that! The actual game is more impressive than the opening! If you shoot a car with fireworks in it, the fire explodes and you won't believe it's fake. Then, you notice that the glass is falling faster than the rubber, but slower than the titanium. You will then see smoke immerse the whole area, and it crawls into cracks and bounces off railing. When it slowly clears, you'll see a scorched car. Now, with just that mind, think of what the rest of it is like. There is no blood, which I actually enjoy, because it seems pointless to make it into some Resident Evil slaughterfest. Dead bodies disappear, explosives remain charcoled, cars remain dented. When you hold a gun, you can see the reflections of stuff on the shiny side. You would not believe what had to have gone into this. The graphics without a doubt MUST be a 10/10.You want to know how cool the sound is? Just look at the things characters say. \"Bond is here!\" \"You're a dead man Bond!\" \"Over here, quick!\" \"Sound the alarm!\" \"My turn!\" \"Bond is here!\" \"You're a dead man Bond!\" \"Over here, quick!\" \"Sound the alarm!\" \"My turn!\" Unfortunately a lack of diverse dialogue among enemies is in this game. There are two types of voices. Some girls say these things, and men can say this with an American accent or a Spanish accent, depending on the level. Bullet firing is mostly the same depending on the gun. Ricocheted bullets have about 2 different sfx. Explosions sound the same. All together, it's not the greatest. Most \"Bosses\" talk to you, and M and Q will say things, but sometimes the same things, in levels. All in all, in a first-person shooter/adventure/action game, you have to imagine it is hard to have so many different sfx. I feel justful in giving the sound element a 7/10.In a first person shooter, speed isn't everything. Game speed plays a factor, but in AUF it runs at a good normal speed. Loading time is ok. It takes about 3-5 seconds to load, save or start a game. What really bugs me is when you have an objective complete and it transfers you to a different place, you'll pause while bullets fly everywhere (you can't be harmed) and people are yelling until the next level starts. In the first level, you press an elevator button, and the game pauses and starts up again at the destination of the elevator. Immediately, you are open to enemy fire, with little time to react. All in all, I think speed deserves a good 8.5/10.Ugh. Unfortunately, the controls on this game kill it. Unlike N64 007 games, where Z (conveniently located in the back of the controller where your middle finger rests) is to shoot, A is to open doors and B is to change, while holding B then press A switches gadgets, our press start to pause the game then select the weapon/gadget of your choice without flipping through your entire inventory, these controls make no sense. The Control pad, (Not the analog stick, the thing that moves around) which your entire thumb could easily fit over, is to change weapon and gadget. Pressing left or right flips through gadgets, then to use it you press B. To flip through weapons, use up or down, then R (on top of the controller pad where your index finger is) to shoot. L (Your other index finger) is to aim, and Z, for some reason, is to change modes (silenced, not silenced, Auto zoom, maximum zoom, auto fire, single shot, blast, etc.) and A is your \"action key\", but also automatically empties your guns barrels and puts in a new one, which can cost you a maximum of half in the barrel now if your unlucky. I have to say, the controlling is horrible. James Bond, you are the weakest controller. Goodbye. 6/10 is MORE than fair for the controller. YUCK!One word: Rent it... okay two words, whatever. With a minimum of 12 levels, which one completed there is little need to play the lengthy levels again, and Multiplayer is not to good, you can only be against the CPU in certain games, and games with human people are extremely short. You may want to try a level again to home to receive a high score, then a gold medal, then do it again for a platinum medal. But, in the end, it doesn't really add up. You won't want to replay so; I give it a mere 6/10.As you can see, if you want a good game to play over the weekend, or on a vacation, just borrow it from someone or someplace. You'll have, as bond says in one level \"A barrel of fun\" for a few days.Let's reviewGameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10Speed: 8.5/10Controls: 6/10Replay value: 6/10Total: 47.5/60 giving James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire a 79.67.CHEATS: You acquire cheats by completing levels with a certain score (scoring is brand new to 007 games) and get bonuses. Then, play again when you have a gold medal, and if you find a certain # of 007 medallions, you get even more benefits with a platinum medal.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best games, ever, for the PS2","reviewText":"Next to the Final Fantasy series, the Dragon Quest series is probably the best known RPG series in the video game world.  Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King not only proves this statement even more so, but makes a true, worthy debut on the PS2 with a revamped look, and an engrossing and engaging story.  Without giving too much in the latter department away, Dragon Quest VIII manages to keep the gamer enthralled while you take on hordes of enemies in the tried but true random and turn based battle system.  While a majority of these battles are difficult and even borderline on annoying, Dragon Quest VIII still manages to pack in enough originality to a tired genre and presentation thanks to some brilliantly designed monsters, landscapes, and characters in your party.  While they may seem like cardboard cutout copies of atypical RPG characters, each person you meet and engage has their own unique personality.  The game also boasts some gorgeous graphics for a PS2 game, not to mention some wonderful music and voice acting to boot.  The game's unique charm and humor combined with a lengthy quest all helo make Dragon Quest VIII even more of a slam dunk.  RPG's rarely get any better than this.  If you missed out on Dragon Quest VIII when it first came out, you have no reason to miss out on it now.  This isn't only one of the best RPG's you'll ever play, it's one of the best games ever for PS2 regardless of the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2007"}

Each level in Dishonored gives you a sandbox to toy around in and lets the player run wild with their imagination as to how they will get through each situation. Gone are the overly scripted scenarios you're used to in games that funnel you down a certain path that the designers carved out for you. Dishonored is a game that asks the player to think, to use their noggin, to overcome the obstacles, and while you have many tools at your disposal, it's your choice to decide how you use them and how you make your way through each environment. Do you prefer to kill every enemy in your path with weapons? Do you prefer to take them out through silent means? Or, another possibility and the most gratifying of all, is to make your way through the game without killing a single enemy. Everything's up to you, which is the true beauty of Dishonored. Dishonored's a true \"water cooler\" game where no two people will play the same and it's fun to talk to others and see how they played through the game. It's a deep game that only asks the player to think for once. Sometimes thinking for yourself can be fun.Dishonored's art direction is beyond amazing. It's important to note that one of the minds behind the art is Viktor Antonov, who was also the mind behind Half Life 2's City 17. Harvey Smith, Co-creative Director at Arkane Studios, has said that they went for a \"water color\" look with the game's graphics, which is an apt description. While you won't be blown away by the textures or anything, it's still one of the most beautiful games out there because of its unique aesthetic.Dishonored is one of those games we rarely see in this day and age. Harvey Smith, known for his work on Deus Ex and Thief, brings his experience from past games to make a new intellectual property that carries the same gameplay principals but puts it in a new and interesting world. This is a game that deserves to be supported. It's a rare and unique experience that no one should miss out on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A creepy sequel with a story that still doesn't make any sense","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing atmosphere, stripped away the bad stuff from FEAR 1, awesome mechs, well balancedThe Bad: Mostly same weapons, a tad short, lame multiplayer, stupid cliffhanger ending (FEAR 3?), more or less the same as FEAR 1FEAR was a hyped up FPS back in 2006 that started the whole \"creepy girl with the black hair over her face\" thing. FEAR was so great, not because of it's FPS action, but because of it's well executed disturbing atmosphere. FEAR 2 is no exception with everything bad stripped from the first and lots of new things thrown in. FEAR 2 is your basic FPS at heart, but if you look beyond the veil you'll see something truly wonderful and that's, once again, the incredible atmosphere FEAR 2 portrays. If you didn't already know, Alma is the creepy girl we are after that is somehow connected to soldiers called Replicas, whilst she can control them telepathically. While the story in the first game was almost impossible to follow the same problem infects FEAR 2 until toward the last few chapters where the developers stop playing mind games and finally spill the beans on what and who Alma really is.The main thing here I need to talk about though is atmosphere, you walk through school hallways hearing lockers slam and things swirling around with darkness all around you. Disturbing ghostly apparitions appear that you must shoot, creepy super humans infect certain areas, and just overall the flashbacks you get of Alma are pretty damn creepy. The most scary parts in the game were when your flashlight somehow stopped working and all you can do is find your way around with flickering lights. While the atmosphere is great (especially with headphones on and the lights off!) FEAR 2 has some new gameplay mechanics that make the game even better. While new guns are added a lot of the older ones are improved (along with the difficulty toned WAY down). Most of your guns are average such as machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles etc. The only unique guns are the Hammerhead (shoots green needles that impale enemies to walls), the Laser rifle (a giant laser that shreds through everything), and the Pulse rifle (which shoots giant blue orbs that disintegrate everything in it's path). Of course these guns are harder to find and are rarer, but they have their uses.My favorite addition are the mech sections...yes who would have thought FEAR would have mechs. Remember those annoying mechs in the first FEAR? Well now you can ride them! Hop into these heaping piles of metal and you get your standard machine gun and rockets, but the mech controls so well and the machine gun feels so powerful. It's great to see your enemies explode in a gory mess after a few machine guns rounds and you really feel you're more powerful for them for once. If your health starts running low hop out for a few minutes and your health will be restored. Included with old mechanics are the slow-mo, health injectors (that are really hard to find), easier to unlock achievements, and still lame multiplayer. I also have to mention how firefights are nicely balanced with just wondering around enjoying the atmosphere.Everything is just superb cosmetically with great voice acting, beautiful visuals (although they could still be better), and great lighting effects. Of course the campaign is a tad short running in at about 6-8 hours and the cliffhanger ending is really retarded (aren't they all? *HALO 2*) Overall the game just builds up into a nice climax and that's what we usually love with shooters. While I recommend FEAR 2 for a great weekend rental it's nothing really more than that. The game is still (to it's core) FEAR 1 which was monotonous shooting and FEAR 2 kind of feels that way towards the end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B006JKARN0","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wertz \"Imautobot\"","summary":"Extremely detailed racer.","reviewText":"Previously I'd played the first 2 in the GT series, and this one has not let down the GT legacy.  The series has always been known to be extremely detailed, so much so that I can see many people obsessing about trying to cover every aspect of the game.  Personally I won't go that far.They pour the polygons into the cars and tracks, but the backgrounds always suffer.  The flatness of scenery becomes apparent if you spend too much time looking at it,  but I suppose they expect you'll be too busy keeping your eyes on the road.  Regardless, this is one area that I would like to see this game improved.  The richness in detail that you find in the scenery of a Forza game is far superior.  Though to be fair, Forza never seemed as tweakable as the GT series.  So at the end of the day these are two different animals.I also have issues with the default controller set-up.  It's too convoluted, but that reflects back on the highly detailed aspect of the game.  I mean, it's got controls for the horn, headlights (high and low beam), that's a bit much.  Some nominal control option would have been preferred, instead I had to go in and invalidate most of the mindless stuff that I personally will never use, or only get confused when heading into a turn too quickly.One thing that caught me off guard was the update/install process.  To be entirely honest, I think it took at least 2 hours.  This seemed excessive to me, especially since 2 discs of Forza can be installed in about 20 minutes on the Xbox.  So the time it takes to actually get to enjoy the game is excessive and annoying.Other than those gripes, I have nothing left but praise.  The cars are beautiful, the racing is definitely more simulation than arcade.  Though, the lack of damage is something worth considering.  It's obviously not realistic to sideswipe an opponent and go on driving in a pristine car.  At least other games make an effort to show damage and let it affect your driving.  Beyond tire wear and dirt, I'm not sure GT does anything of the kind.All that said, I am looking forward to the 6th installment, though I am confused why they would release it on PS3 when it's coming out after the PS4.[EDIT]The game's music leaves something to be desired.  I thought there was hope because the game supports your own music.  This was easier said than done, it's simply not a straight-forward process like what I've experience with custom soundtracks on the Xbox.  Once I managed to tell the game to play my music, I found that regardless of the fact that it's set to \"shuffle\" the sequence will always start on the same song before actually shuffling.  Then, seemingly for no reason, the game will go back to playing the game music during the menus or the next race.  When I go to see if the settings somehow changed, they're still set for my personal music.  So I'm left scratching me head here, it's like being teased about the potential for greatness.  I want to believe this is my fault, but I've searched high and low for an answer, and I can't find one.  Other than the possibility that custom music was a poorly implemented feature, the only other thing I can conclude is that it's just glitchy and broken.As far as gameplay goes, this game does nothing to warn you if you're taking an under-powered car into a race.  This is very unfortunate.  And again, I have to say that maybe I've been spoiled by Forza which takes the guess work out by telling you before entering a race that you \"might\" want to upgrade your car to remain competitive.  This is annoying considering the minute or so you spend loading a race, then you'll realize you're car is under powered after a couple minutes of racing, then you either complete the race in a bad position, or quit the race.  At which point you return to the menu, tune up your car (which wastes more time on an extraneous animation of your car going in and out of a garage), and eventually get back to racing again.  I'm sure there is a stat that an observant person might catch before having all this happens which would guide the playing toward tuning prior to a race, but I'm a guy who doesn't want to do much more than race.  This superfluous jump-through-hoops type of stuff is really really frustrating.  Maybe this racer is just too detailed, or maybe this is just a reflection of it's country of origin.  Forza being an American franchise is likely nerfed to appeal to people who are apathetic about the minute details (like me), while the Gran Turismo franchise is likely geared toward people who are real sticklers about every little thing.  Gran Turismo is like a beautiful woman; you might fall in love with her at first sight, then she opens her mouth, and your heart shatters in six different places.  And all you can do now is just learn to love her flaws.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2013"}

I loved the graphics and the story but it definitely earns its \"T\" rating. It's rated T for mild language but the characters use that Mild language a whole lot particularly \"The D word\" and some very suggestive dialogue. \"We all fell asleep? you didn't... touch the princess did you?\" The game is also full of subtle statements and symbols about religion so if you care about things of that nature then be advised that there is prayer to a number of objects as well as items like \"ANNOYntment\". . As far as gameplay goes it's a turn-based RPG which ,  while annoying at first is very easy to get used to. As the name imples, you  and your opponent take turns attacking each other. The only thing I found incredibly frustrating was a virtually useless map(Aside from a pointer and dots you never know exactly where you are)  and the fact that you can't run a foot without being attacked by a monster.(I thought Pok&eacute;mon coined that.)  It gets rather tedious, especially when you're low on potions. The music is great for its time and I think they did a spectacular job of making the Characters likeable and well rounded but the bad guys were left out of that loop and pretty clich&eacute;. This wouldn't be a problem if the game hadn't already succeeded in making so many clich&eacute;s likable again. The princess commoner crush with Zidane and Garnett, Loyal knight with Steiner. Philosopher(Of sorts) with Vivi,  and a medieval setting.  All are  given a new spin but the villains are just flat and extremely so. Brahne's only reason for being so cruel and is the death of her husband and Kuja seems interested in power for power's sake. The main villain is even flatter than they are.The game also feels extremely rushed to where the supposed \"Big Twists\" become more like Deus ex Machina or are so \"matter of fact\" it makes the drama fail miserably. For instance DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS. Garnett goes to one place. Just one place and in that instant has a vague flashback that reveals to the player that Brahne is not her real mother when (depending on how skilled you are) not twenty minutes before, we have Eiko going on about how her race is extinct and being alone. It's the equivalent of:Eiko: It's nice to have guests especially since I'm the last of my race.Garnett: What a beautiful cave. *Gasps as thirty second flashback commences* My mother is not my real mother. I'm a native of Mandain Sari!Eiko: I'm not alone anymore, Yay! Let's go pray to the wall.O.0....This was never even remotely hinted at previously. (Aside from Branhe's hideously ugly face and body in comparison to Garnett's beautiful appearance,Arguably.) It's random and did not have the intended shock value. Sure, they develop Eiko and Garnett in other ways but it doesn't excuse how rushed everything feels emotion wise.Aside from that I was able to sympathize with these characters (at least the good ones), Learn their strengths and weaknesses via an easy battle system and feel pretty awesome doing it. Overall it was a fun game but DEFINITELY a Teen one.I admit I was about halfway through Disc three before I had to quit playing altogether and toss my copy into the garbage (Due to content. If I wanted to read that much profanity I could've just picked up Catcher in the Rye for a lot less. ) that and the fact  two and a half of four discs is more than enough time to develop at least one villain to a satisfactory extent and this wasn't done. We had at least four and they're all woefully one-dimensional.Villains make a story and the ones in this story didn't enthrall me at all. Sure, It's great that you're a greedy evil queen but WHY? What was it about your husband that kept you from greed? Did he change you before? Why are you so ugly? What's your backstory???SURE it's great that you want power and to defy those who made you but WHY? SPOILER! Why did you team up with the evil queen just to kill her and make Garnett the new queen? Wouldn't it have made more sense to gain power by rubbing shoulders with the queen and Garnett only to kill them both so YOU'D rise to power next?Where the heck did you come from old guy in armor? Why weren't you mentioned two discs ago?Ugh. Villain development needed badly.To be honest I was hooked but this game just didn't do it for me.

You are a secret operative sent to kill \"The Jackal\" if you can find him.2) The graphics are beautiful. Lush jungles, beautiful african countryside, waterfalls, complete day/night cycle with rain, wind, etc. Zebras, rhinos, and other animals walking around.3) Gun and vehicle sounds seem accurate. There is often african music playing in the background, like you'll be in the thick heavy jungle hearing bongo drums, really cool.4) You can save only at safehouses, or during certain points of the story. BUT once every 24 hours you have a second life available. Basically one of your buddies will come rescue you. So if you get rescued, retreat and head to a safehouse and wait for 24 hours.5) The gameplay CAN be frustrating. Use the internet and read guides. The AI is devious. They hide, flank, take cover, etc. Enemy snipers can shoot you from almost a mile away.6) The game is LONG. Do not expect to finish it in a week. This is one of those games you can play for YEARS.Basically my style is total stealth. I go out only at night, drive with the headlights off, when I get close to anything I get out and walk. I do recon before attacking. I try to take high points and scope, plan my attack. If there's explosives in the camp sometimes I snipe it to create a huge explosion, taking out a couple guards from the word go. Other times I will sneak in close with a silenced weapon, take down a few guards before they raise the alarm.Tips :In the beginning get AK47 + accuracy mod. And a grenade bandolier. It will be a long time before you can afford proper gear.Take your time. There's no rush. The adventure is not the mission. The adventure is what happens ON THE WAY to the mission. The meat of this game is the travel. It might take me 2-3 play sessions before I even GET to the mission. If you are tired of getting jumped by patrols, get out of the car and WALK.Car is temporary thing you use. It is a short-term tool. Don't get attached to it.Remember to use grenades. Molotov to set fires and cover your retreat. Throw 2 molotov and back up, the enemy will not follow thru the fire.Do the weapon dealer missions ASAP.IED is very useful for killing patrols. You can set 2-3 of them, take out the whole patrol of 3 vehicles with 1 click.Buy stealth suit as soon as you can afford to.Make sure you have a rescue-ready buddy before you leave your safe house.Plan your attacks. Do recon. Crouch walk. Use silenced weapons to thin foes.When you are discovered, be violent and brutal. Toss 1 grenade, burn a clip, toss another grenade, burn another clip. Mow them down like grass.IED + car = Cartillery. Drive fast, jump out, wait for the car to roll into the camp, BOOM.Sniping. Dragunov. Shoot the guy in the leg. His friend comes over to help. Shoot friend.Silenced mp5 rocks. Crouch walk silently and aim for the head.Gun trucks. Get in the turret, turn it toward the back of the vehicle. Drive thru enemy camp to the other side. Jump into the turret while the vehicle is still rolling. Gun everybody down.----Bottom lineThis is a %90+ game. It rocks. Get it. Play it.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

Not a big fan. There's a major reason there's a million copies of this game in the bargain bin of any used game store.I'd never played games with similiar control schemes like the Resident Evil games myself so I'm not used to the choppy control style and the lack of platforming (no jumping period). The cinematics were wonderful and dramatic. Whoever designed the visuals deserves a raise, but I HATE the controls. The worst thing about the control is that manuevering is a 2 step process instead of a more intuitive and efficient 1 step process.For example, let's say you want your character to walk to the right. You must FIRST rotate him in the direction you want to go THEN press forward on the directional pad (this ain't an FPS). He rotates way too slow. They try and compensate for this by using another button to pull off a quick 180 turn, also your character will often automatically face the next enemy the AI thinks you will want to strike. When you're surrounded by three enemies, your disadvantage is compounded. Some may say this is challenging, I just call it what it is, crappy play control. Also, the fact that you can simply just tap the attack button and watch your character slice several enemies in sequence without doing anything else is not a plus in my book. I want a game that actually requires me to play it, not tap a button mindlessly. I think this exemplifies the meaning of the term \"button mashing\".If you want an action packed and cinematically impressive hack-'em-up I highly recommend \"God of War\". [see my other reviews] The gameplay was loads better and just as impressive graphically if not more so.

Final Fantasy 4 is first then Chrono Trigger. Note that the combined score is 4 stars. Final Fantasy 4: The prodigal son returns some would say. This time it is the athentic Japanese version too. To those who don't know the Super Nintendo release was, shall we say, dumbed down for the Americans (since when are Americans dumb?  We are 10 and 1 after all: review history if you don't understand). Not anymore. The script is the original. No more \"you spoony bard,\" which was much more colorful in the Japanese version. New spells, abilites, and even monsters have arrisen and have kicked the game's difficulty up several notches. As if the game wasn't hard enough to begin with. The music is still the same old 16-bit music but it still is moving. The story is very deep and contains death, betrayal, and love. This was back when Square focused more on story than on graphics and cinematics. Speaking of which the cinematics are beautiful. They do show !signs of being not as well done as some other CG movies that Square has produced. This game received 4.5 stars. Chrono Trigger: The prequel of Chrono Cross with many sad problems. The main one is the hideously evil load times. These mainly occur during the battle and non-battle mode changes. The lag time is about three seconds in many places. This slows down the game in such a way that those who played the original cartidge will quickly become antsy because things are taking longer then they are used to. The slow down also makes it hard to build levels without going mad. The slowdown also affects the anime movies. The beginning sequence is jumpy and seems to progress very oddly. The movies would have been beautifully well done if only they didn't have these problems. The music is very well done as well. Who could forget Magus's dark theme or Frog's heroic overture. They have returned, in all their Super Nintendo glory, and have been well preserved. As an added feature you can !access any of the movies, songs, and other specials after you have come across them or have completed one of the 12+ endings in the game. The story is very complex and it is hard to keep up with, especially with several time periods and many things happening at once. This usually occurs after you get to...The End of Time. Insert onimous music here. A very deep skill and tech system is the games crowning feature, and gives you the reason to fight the maddeningly slowed down battles. All in all the game received 3.5 stars. It is fairly obvious that the gem in this re-release is Final Fantasy 4.

This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Another let-down for 2008","reviewText":"[I HAVE played this game on BOTH the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 - thus am posting this review on both consoles.]*sigh*  I had hopes.  In fact I had high hopes, and that's what makes it so dissapointing.It's been said a lot - Most Wanted was a great game.  A fantastic game.  One of the very few games I decided to play through twice just to try a different approach.What made Most Wanted different for a driving game was a compelling story.  It wasn't even a very deep story, but you had conflict right from the get-go and it made you eager - no, determined - to get revenge.  It gave you a clear, linear story - 8 \"bad guys\" (I think it was eight...) to take on until you reached the baddest dude of all - the guy who took your car, took your reputation, even tried to take your girl...  But in between those linear points, the game was a free-for-all.  You had set things you had to do, but you could do them in any order, you could do them however you wanted.  You always knew were the next objective was, but still had that freedom.Undercover is just a cluster.  There's roads everywhere, cops everywhere, races everywhere...  You have no idea what to do.  The story is clear only because we've read about it here on Amazon, on other review sites...  Honestly, the game has never told ME that I'm an undercover cop.The came starts with a car chase - you at the wheel - and a million cops behind you.  You're in a 350z, pretty decked out, Red.  Suddenly you get away.  Then you're watching a clandestine meeting between a woman and a shadowy, male figure.  She says he's going to be their driver.  It wasn't until my second re-start (tried a different console) that I realized, \"Oh, I guess I'm that guy...\"  Next thing you know you're sitting on the street in a POS Nissan.  What happened to the 350z?  What am I doing?  What's the objective?  Who am I??So you start running races - easy to do, just push down on the D-pad and it'll automatically launch the next race.  You'll run a few races and then get a short, somewhat vague cut-scene.  That'll open up a unique race - which you'll run - and nothing special will happen.  So you'll do a few more races, then something else suddenly happens...  It's really only curiosity that keeps you playing.  There's no motivation, no apparent pay-off...  I've played now for a bunch of hours and still have only unlocked a small handful of parts.  I never understood that theory - you have enough money to buy something but it won't let you.  The game just levels up the opponent cars anyways - let me buy whatever I can afford!As far as actual game play goes, it's... ...alright.  Graphics are okay up close, but distances get real vague.  There are a LOT of aliasing issues, and items appear very blocky and granular.  I've had a couple frame-rate issues during auto-saves and what-not - VERY frustrating in a driving game while you're drifting a corner at 140 miles per hour.  Technical tracks become challenging because you can't see far ahead.  You can, but you can't make out what you're looking at.  Is that a turn?  Oh, no - it's a bridge abutment...  Oh and forget the map.  The cities of Undercover are pretty convoluted, which is nice, except that the map doesn't detail elevation changes.  So an intersection that appears on the map could actually be a bridge going over another road.  Oh yeah - that's fun when you're trying to dart a corner while running from cops...  *SMASH* - oh, THAT road is BENEATH me!!!  Thanks for the help!  You're under arrest...I of course have no idea how far into the game I am, but it's not very challenging.  I've won every race, and have \"dominated\" all but a few of the \"jobs.\"  The cops are present, but they lack that... ...je ne c'est pas...  They have no spirit - no soul.  They appear out of nowhere - hit a chase-breaker (usually a road-side object that you can hit to stop chasing police cars) and the game goes into a quick cut-scene to watch the destruction.  That's always fun, except that I've come out of those cut scenes only to plow into a road block that appeared out of nowhere.  Very frustrating.  They seem to pit-maneuver you pretty easily - suddenly accelerating out of nowhere...  But if you keep dodging, taking corners instead of following the road, this isn't much of an issue.  They just don't have the organization of Most Wanted.  They're just sort of... ...there.A lot of the game just seems tacked on.  Remember the first \"Underground\" NFS games?  There were shops everywhere that focused on specific areas, like body parts, performance parts, certain brands of cars...  Now you just push start [pause] and select \"Cars.\"  You basically buy cars and customize them from the pause menu.  How pathetic is that??  And if you actually go to a shop, you see the EXACT same screen.The \"crews\" from Carbon are gone - thank God.  You don't have to hire certain staff members just to customize your car.  Autosculpting is available immediately and that's a welcome change.NFS Undercover quickly becomes boring.  You run a race, unlock some new races, run some of them, and maybe if you're lucky you'll trigger the next story sequence.  But you have no idea, you have no motivation, and all you're left with is another highly anticipated let-down.Stop doing this, gaming industry.  Quit focusing on the dollar and make us some games that are worth playing.  We're tired of looking behind us at \"what was.\"  Give us something to look forward to, or quit wasting our money.  I'm tired of the $60-dollar coasters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

I'm a World War 2 buff so I enjoyed the realism and historical basis of this game but overall it's just a basic, decent game to get your shooter fix. It's an older game yet I was still impressed with the graphics and gameplay. My main complaint is that it gets boring. It lacks variety and it didn't grab my interest enough to make me want to play it for very long stretches of time. I was rarely itching to play it the way I've been with other shooters. Of course part of the problem is that I'm used to playing such greats as Bioshock, Halo 3, Gears of War, and COD4. Call of Duty 2 certainly isn't as good as COD4 but I only paid $10 for a brand new copy of this game and at that price or less it's probably worth the money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Fun, Fast, Flawed","reviewText":"EDIT:  Below I make comments about the multiplayer and it is the multiplayer that has reduced my score from 5 to 4 stars.  According to IGN, the developers are working on a patch that will, at least, fix the lag.  Chances are it will change the way you find groups *crosses fingers*.  I will continue to update this to reflect the latest news.There are a couple of FPSs to think about during Xbox 360's launch.  Call of Duty 2 is probably the more exciting and thrilling of these launch titles, boasting beautiful graphics, fast game play and silky smooth controls.  If you have HD, it is even better.  I never truly understood the difference in picture quality until I saw the game running side by side on a HD and a regular TV and it is remarkable.The game is broken down into two categories, the single player and the multiplayer.  The single player game is intense.  It drops you in the middle of three campaigns and things heat up from there.  It feels like you are in the middle of a war-torn battlefield.  The immersion is great.  Your teammates are actually decent, the enemies will pick up and throw back grenades at you that you have already thrown.  Sometimes the enemy AI is pretty stupid but overall it is really well implemented.  Every mission feels like war is being thrown in your face.  Its do or die and the bullets are whizzing by.  Its incredibly intense and exciting.  Every mission should have you trying to catch your breath by the end.The sound is amazing, particularly on a surround sound equipped TV.  In the single player and in the multiplayer it is incredibly useful.  For example, if you are playing multiplayer and hear footsteps behind you but your radar doesn't indicate any friendlies near you, you might want to turn around.  This has saved my life countless times.  That is, unless the enemy is crouch-walking and silent, which is another story...The part of the game that is so important right now is the online portion.  And unfortunately, this is where the \"flawed\" part of my title comes into play.  Multiplayer is a lot of fun.  The games are quick moving, finding a room is (with exception explained below) simple and usually quick.  Getting into the action is great.  There is a huge assortment of levels and a lot of different gametypes from death match (and team DM), search and destroy, HQs, etc etc.  You will find something fun here level-wise and setting wise.  Using the weapons again is smooth and control is great.The gameplay tends to run slow than Halo 2 (for those who played Halo 2).  I happen to like this type of gameplay.  Instead of just running around aimlessly shooting your guns until your ammo is depleted, you have to think.  Its more realistic.  The shades of your costumes usually match the setting and so you have to have your wits about you.  The war-torn cities are amazing and produce some agonizingly intense matchs where you never know where that sniper is until he shoots (the radar only picks up enemies that shoot).  Its slower paced but I absolutely love it and would have it no other way.Its too bad that some design flaws keep this game from being a perfect 5 stars.  The biggest flaw is that they didn't take a page from Halo 2.  Halo 2 has probably the very best console way of finding people, playing with your friends and keeping in contact.  Call of Duty 2 has none of this.  If you have friends that want to play with you, you can't start a party and keep them together.  What ends up happening is, one person will have to find a game and everyone else will have to go into their dashboard on the person's name and click \"join game in session\" and hope that they get in before the game finds its 8 people.When the mission is over, you have to do this again.  After completing a match, the game kicks you back to the pre-lobby screen where you go to find another match.  You can't stick together with your friends nor with people you just played with.  Why did they do this?  I can't fathom any reason for this other than they didn't have enough time to successfully implement it.  It is irritating trying to get your friends to play with you when the system isn't built around it.Another glaring flaw is the server stability.  I can't count how many times someone has joined the game and the server lags.  Lags to the point that when your character moves, it makes you feel like you're drunk, stumbling around everywhere.  Also, sometimes joining a game is a pain because of the \"server full\" notices or other error messages that pop up.  Sometimes it takes 3 or 4 or so tries to actually get into the pre-game lobby.Another problem is that when you get into the game you are able to decide which team or let the computer auto-assign.  This is great in theory; unfortunately, what ends up happening is you have a team of 5 against a team of 3 or worse.  Then people can switch over teams at will which can cause confusion and can make some of the games underbalanced.A final problem is part server problems part user problems.  A lot of times you start out with a full match of 8 people, but by the end of the match you are down to 2 vrs 2.  Or 1 vrs 2.  People either disconnect due to the server or just plain leave.  And it is very annoying to those of us who are trying to just have fun when all of a sudden 3/4 of your team is gone but the other side still has a full team.I have been pretty harsh on the multiplayer but I stand by it.  It has the potential to be the best mutliplayer experience on the 360 for a long time coming (particularly with the very believable possibility that Halo 3 won't be launching until the Halo movie comes out in 2007) but the design flaws and server stability issues really hurt it.  The actual game design helps keep this game a solid 4 star game; its definitely above average.  I just wish they could fix the other problems that would help this game soar.  Right now, I have to recommend purchasing this game.  Just keep in mind there are problems that can and probably will annoy you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2005"}

It had very high expectations upon release, and thankfully MK7 delivers in virtually every aspect, in fact even predominantly outdoing its predecessor, the hugely successful Mario Kart Wii.The premise remains once again the same: you grab your favorite Mario character, hop in the cartoony go-kart of your choice and race along a series of wildly designed tracks against several opponents (either human or AI)-with the help of some destructive weaponry and items, of course. As with most installments in the series, there are a handful of new mechanics that make MK7 unique, and like its predecessor's additions of motion control, tricking and heavier implementation of online play, some of these are likely to stick with the series for the long haul (which in this case is luckily a good thing). The most notable new feature is gliding, which occurs during long jumps or gaps in the courses; a large glider attachment will protrude from your character's kart and you'll then be completely airborne, able to soar right over twists, turns and obstacles below you, at a rather substantial speed. You have the option of steering upward to remain in flight even longer, or downward to descend sooner to nab an item box or coin. This is particularly rewarding when you can glide right past opponents below who were unlucky enough to miss the jump panel, adding a compelling strategic edge to various tracks by allowing players to essentially create their own shortcuts. New track Maka Wuhu is perhaps the greatest example of this, offering so many alternative routes that it may in fact be the most strategy-based course ever in a Mario Kart game.Another addition is the ability to drive underwater, meaning those instances of steering alongside or above oceans and lakes are nowhere near as daunting as they were before. Once you're submerged, your kart will sprout a propeller like a submarine, and you'll then notice some severe changes in maneuverability. Sea sunken karts take turns and drifts looser, and also jump and move higher when struck. Some players may notice an illusion of reduced speed, but you'll in fact lose little speed underwater unless you have trouble navigating through turns and obstacles, in which case recovering quickly can be tricky. Some of these factors may make it sound like you'll want to stay out of the water, but there are in fact most often goodies beneath the surface that make it worth exploring-treasure troves of coins and item boxes tend to be more abundant in underwater sections, giving great opportunities to stock up, particularly early on in a race.As you may have gathered by now, MK7 marks the triumphant return of coins, which have been long-absent from a vast majority of Mario Kart installments. Once again, collecting 10 of them allows your vehicle to reach its true top speed, making the game in general a bit more skill-based (always a plus in something like Mario Kart). You have to maneuver courses properly and outrun opponents to collect most coins, and you'll lose some each time you're struck by an item or fall off the track. The speed boost they give, granted, is nothing outrageous, so players who've collected (and held onto) all their coins won't have any sort of unbalanced advantage. Some may debate over whether or not this was necessary, but the option of something else to seek out and compete for in Mario Kart almost always equates to more fun and less tediousness as the laps pass. The coins are also worth collecting because you'll need them to gain access to the game's various hidden unlockables.The slew of items, as they often are in Mario Kart games, are once again quite devastating, but interestingly (and thankfully) the rubber-band AI and ridiculously high frequency of game-changing Spiny Shells seems to have been noticeably toned down. On higher difficulty levels, this game seems to focus less on obscene item spam and more on opponents that know their steering and shortcuts. It's (usually) competitive and challenging without being cheap, something that can't often be said of Mario Kart. Although the items do still essentially function the same, you're far less likely to have a Spiny Shell and successive red shell stop you inches before the finish line, particularly when racing the CPU.Many of the items return, including the spinout-inducing Banana Peels and Shells, as well as invincibility-granting Stars and frightening Lightning bolts. The new items are pretty nifty and once again seem to be strategy-minded. The Super Leaf causes your kart to sprout a tail for a short while, which in turn allows you to make spin attacks, which can be used to knock over nearby opponents, as well as destroy certain oncoming items or other obstacles. The fact that it offers both an offensive and defensive edge makes it supremely useful in certain situations. The Fire Flower, meanwhile, behaves similarly in that it acts as a set-time power-up, allowing you to temporarily blast fireballs at opponents in front of or behind you. This item can be particularly fun when you're knee-deep in the fray, as you can use it to quickly clear the field of various opponents-and obstacles. The final and most devastating new item is the Lucky 7, recalling the game's title. This creates not one but a whopping seven different items to surround your vehicle (a Blooper, Bob-omb, Banana Peel, red Shell, green Shell, Star, and Mushroom), allowing you access to each one's individual powers. This may sound incredible, but be cautious; if opposing karts hit any of these items they'll take effect, meaning you might grant another player invincibility or a speed boost, or unintentionally be right in the bomb's blast radius, causing you to lose the other six (therefore it's usually best to get rid of the Bob-omb first).The character roster provided in MK7 is mostly strong; the usual suspects Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Bowser and the remainder of the initial 8 all return, and this time around most of the new additions are actually pretty unique. The mysterious Shy Guy is finally a playable character, as is the temperamental Wiggler. Honey Queen, the ruler of all bees and Rosalina, overseer of the cosmos, both from Mario Galaxy, are also both unlockable characters. Lakitu, the lovable cloud rider who'd been hosting Mario Kart matches for years, is now playable himself, and he even gets his own cloud-themed kart. Metal Mario wasn't really necessary, given that the removal of the babies seems to have been in an intention of clearing out the clones. Although these are spunky, nifty new additions, it really wouldn't have hurt to include a few more; Mario Kart Wii had a whopping 25 characters to choose from, while MK7's roster maxes out at 17. Fans of the babies, Birdo, Waluigi or other Kongs might be disappointed.The tracks in MK7 are astonishingly among the series' best. Music Park is a thrilling spectacle as you race along piano keys and past enormous dancing music notes. Piranha Plant Slide is as much winding fun as its title insinuates, and the eclectic Wario Shipyard is an exhilarating trip through a sunken ship. They were also startlingly intelligent in their retro course choices; while MKW made the clumsy misstep of including some of the series' dullest tracks (was anyone honestly asking for THREE different versions of Mario Circuit....?), some of Mario Kart's brightest and most inventive courses return in MK7's retro cups. Wii's Mushroom Gorge and Maple Treeway, N64's Kalimari Desert, DS's Airship Fortress and Waluigi Pinball, and GCN's Daisy Cruiser and Dino Dino Jungle are all notable highlights. Although I'm a little surprised that iconic tracks like Toad's Turnpike and Frappe Snowland or some of GBA's memorable highlights like Sunset Wilds and Cheese Land still haven't reappeared, here's hoping they're saving those for future retro cups.Although the customary Mario Circuit, Bowser's Castle and Rainbow Road courses once again have new revamps, they're very innovative this time around. Mario Circuit is decorated with Japanese-themed blooming cherry trees; you'll drive through a flurry of petals in the track's most memorable section. MK7's Rainbow Road, meanwhile, is a beautifully designed and expectedly colorful cruise through the stars, with a particularly enjoyable pass over the surface of the moon. It also, along with a good handful of other tracks here, marks something that should become a staple for all future Mario Kart games: track differentiation between laps. Rather than making repeated laps through the same track, many MK7 courses are one long course, and as you pass each lap line, you'll enter a new area with completely different roadway and scenery than what preceded it. This was a phenomenal choice on the developers' parts, as the constant change of scenery essentially adds up to a greater variety of content, meaning the concerns of things feeling tedious come lap 3 are long gone. I sincerely hope this is something the series sticks with.Like MKW, MK7 offers motion control, something I admittedly scoffed at when I heard of its existence. The thought of motion control on the 3DS sounded beyond wonky, as I was expecting awkward maneuverability along with constant loss of the sweet spot (and therefore irritated eyes). Shockingly, this game makes it work, and it's a control option I can genuinely recommend to those who favor it. So long as you're not overcompensating your movements, it is in fact quite simple to keep the sweet spot intact, and the system is impressively responsive to minute movements. Although I'm far too used to using joysticks and buttons by now, it's something everyone should give a try.The online mode in MK7 is among its biggest successes. Like Mario Kart Wii, you can quickly hop online for a match against several different people all over the world, as well as race against your friends via online or local wireless. The wi-fi matches are really what give these games replay value, particularly once all the content has been unlocked and the 1-Player mode's over and done with. Also like MKW, you'll have a 'VR' rating, through which you will gain or lose points depending on how well you do in online matches; you'll know you're up against someone skilled if they have a high VR, particularly if there are stars displayed next to their name (meaning they performed extremely well in each 1-player mode cup and CC). It's somewhat less off-kilter than before and unlike MKW, you thankfully will not suffer a loss of several hundred points for getting disconnected. You can also auto-add each of your opponents via Spotpass, which will then allow you to race them again at your leisure whenever they're online. Mario Kart Channel even allows you to follow or join different communities, which race under specific conditions. This is a great way of tracking down racers of similar skill, or better yet racing with pure skill (i.e. no Spiny Shells, or anything else for that matter, as desired). Although Nintendo has yet to truly utilize its slowly forming online community as many other consoles have, this is a great start and a very sturdy online mode for a great game.Ironically, the game's most glaring misstep might be its deeply awkward system of unlockables. Although hidden characters are unlocked by completing cups on 150cc, as they should be, unlocking vehicles and most anything else is a strenuous process with jumbled results-vehicles, gliders and wheels are all unlocked by collecting coins throughout both online and offline races, but they unlock randomly, meaning if you want something specific you'll just have to go at it and hope for the best. This was a poor decision and makes unlocking everything an exhaustive task that few may have any desire to achieve. Another minor gripe is the game's Battle Mode; although there are some very nice new Battle Courses, they've once again screwed over Balloon Battle, meaning it's less a game of individual survival and more a game of collecting points for your team for striking foes. Future Mario Karts should take note from the N64 version and stick with what was fun. The fact that the DS's wonderful mission mode hasn't made a repeat appearance is also quite disappointing. Who wouldn't love Mario Kart'ing against enemy bosses or racing for something other than the finish line? Frankly Diddy Kong Racing had the right idea.Although a larger roster and improved unlockable system would have really tightened the seams, Mario Kart 7 is a fantastic addition to the series, offering several great innovations that will hopefully make repeat appearances in the generations to come. If you're a fan of Mario Kart, the 3DS, Nintendo, or racing games in general, this is something you absolutely can't pass up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JZIS","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Incredible hardware with amazing potential, hampered only by too much emphasis on touch screen capacity","reviewText":"The Vita is awesome. I really couldn't realize it, until I had received mine in the mail, and held it in my hands. I had a PSP, and this thing is light years beyond the console that it replaced. The Vita feels incredibly comfortable, perhaps even more so than my trusty Dual Shock controllers. The miniature, twin analog sticks are brilliantly implemented, comfortable, and they function perfectly. Likewise, the shoulder buttons (and face buttons) are perfectly placed and easy to engage. Ergonomically, I couldn't ask for anything more- the Vita just feels good in my hands, and I can play it at length without any discomfort.The only time it's NOT comfortable (or fun) is when a game forces me to use the touch screen, whereupon I'm forced to awkwardly start bumbling with the screen (or even worse, the back touch interface) with one hand, while I hang onto the console with my other hand. It's my hope that Sony will stop forcing gamers to use these awkward touch schemes. Why on earth would they develop such perfect physical controls for their handheld, and then ignore them at times? If we want to play games with touch, there are dozens of options- Kindle Fire, iPad, smart phones, etc. The Vita can and should be the ALTERNATIVE to everything else, not one more touch device that will be lost in a sea of similar devices. I can't begin to describe the frustration I felt when I was forced to use touch while playing \"Golden Abyss\" or \"Mutant Blobs from Space\". I actually had to stop playing the latter game, because I couldn't adjust to the touch portions, and they brought the fun factor to a screeching halt for me.Now back to the good stuff... The 5\" OLED screen is stunning. You really can't appreciate its vibrancy or effectiveness until you hold a Vita in your hands, and you'll most likely be surprised by its size (it seems way bigger than the PSP). Also nice is the fact that despite this large screen, the Vita easily fits into a front pants pocket, and it's rather light in weight.As for the games that I've played, they've been truly impressive, though I haven't yet seen anything that I think is quite on par with the PS3 from a technical perspective. Nonetheless, the performance that has been crammed into this handheld is downright mind boggling. I have very high hopes for the future of the Vita, and I'm confident that it can succeed, while bringing a great deal of fun to gamers- so long as it utilizes the brilliant physical controls that are its trump card, and leaves the touch stuff to other devices.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2012"}

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it&rsquo;s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"Makes me want to get into heavy metal","reviewText":"Definitely a strange game from top to bottom. But as the opening begins you'll know your in for a real treat. Brutal legend is a well crafted game. Its like fine wine. Its made for those who appreciate entertainment and originality when it comes to video game.Its not pretentious and it never sets out to tell a dramatic award winning tale. Instead the story is about an unlikely hero with a passion for an art that he feels has been dying. The art is heavy metal rock, Eddie our hero is a person who appreciates and respects the old days of rock n roll. He does what he can to preserve the notion that old school rock is alive and well but its just not hitting well with the new generation.An unforeseen incident awakens the true spirit of rock and transport our hero to world where the very soil breaths heavy metal. Thus Eddie's adventure really begins.GAMEPLAY: It plays like a 3rd person action adventure game. But then it throws you for a loop when it turns into a action RTS and you'll have to change up how you play when you have dozens of allies waiting on your command. The stage battles will be the grand finales usually, everything you do will lead up to these showdowns. At first it will be difficult but the game gives you enough pointers to keep you in the loop. Again it will come at a surprise but you'll figure it out. The RTS elements are rewarding and its never excessive. Most of what you'll be doing it completing missions in the open world. You'll be able to drive and explore at you leisure.SOUND: A well casted group of characters. Most noteworthy being Jack Black who plays Eddie's. He really gets into the role and you can tell he's having fun from the get go. All the performances are great with all the other characters doing their parts well.The music is fantastic, the creators really love rock and their choices in songs shows this. Don't expect to see any metal stuff its pretty much classic selection of songs. More of these songs can be unlocked via exploration. And you can always play your own music with the Xbox 360's dashboard.REPLAY: You'll most likely play this again as there is a multiplayer that is fun if you liked the RTS gamplay from the main game. The achievements are basic and are all mostly single player related with very few being online. If you rushed through it to finish it would be worth while to go back into it to explore the large open world. Plenty of content here for the low price that its going for now.Brutal Legend is excellent game that any fan of action adventure will really enjoy. And those who love rock well this game is a love letter to you. Enjoy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

After this hell ended, I found out the Disc provided (Nintendo Land) is a complete joke, no real games, just some outdated boring mini games which most requires multiplayers, sadly for me im usually solo player. In addition to all of that, most Wii & possibly Wii U games require Nintendo Remote plus which is not provided in the so called \"deluxe\" box. In fact, having the remote is much more important than the gamepad, so you have spend extra bucks to buy the remote and probably will spend more to get the pro controller, all these addition spendings before you actually start to play a game.Comes to games, there is nothing to play except 2 or 3 worthy games, but I bought Wii U to play the missed Wii games, however, if you own Wii, I guess it's no point in upgrading to Wii U because there is nothing much to do with Wii U, unless you want to experience the HD figures which is not a brand new technology that nintendo is proud thay utilized.Nintendo seems they want to make something special that Sony and Microsoft cannot compete with, as much as I was excited, I'm disppointed now, knowing that Wii U will be smashed to the ground when sony launches PS4.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"3DS Not a bad matchup to the Vita at its current price","reviewText":"When I was looking to upgrade (I had a DSi and PSP, which I still have the PSP) I thought, the Vita, without a doubt... at first. I loved the idea of the 3G version (50 bux more than the standard and the option to buy a data plan at anytime and that gives me the ability to play online anywhere without a WiFi connection at my discretion, without committing to any contract, which the 3DS obviously does not have. I liked the idea of a PSP upgrade with a touchscreen, too - no longer would the Nintendo DS systems be the only handhelds to have a touch screen. I also liked the idea of being able to skype on the Vita (you can voice chat on the 3DS but not video... you can also voice skype on the original PSP as a side note, but you have to buy the additional remote for the headset... I think there may be a way to video chat on PSP if you're a good hacker and buy the PSP camera as there isn't a built in camera on the PSP, but I digress). I liked that the VITA bordered an iPhone in terms of available downloadalbe apps. The 3G version has two memory cards, the 8 gig it comes with that is like the PSP one, and an extra SD card on the 3G version. The capabilities graphics-wise rival that of the Playstation 3, and to me, the whole 3D thing was gimmicky, even after I tried it... I wasn't impressed. The price was obviously a huge difference after Nintendo lowered the MSRP, but to me it was worth it, and a no brainer.I did some more thinking, however, and the 3DS began to become the more appealing system, for me personally, anyway.3DS PROS OVER THE VITA: It plays all of your DS games, which is a plus. The Vita does not support the PSP UMDs, which include video discs - the solution is that you can download most PSP games, as well as videos however, if you trade in your PSP, you're having to pay again to have those games and videos, and not all of them are supported. Another option/solution is to keep your PSP of course, which I was going to do if I got the Vita because I felt I had invested too much into it (not only in games, videos, downloads, but also accessories like an expensive headset, case, video component cables to play on TV and watch my UMD videos on TV... I don't own a PS3, I'm a handheld only gamer, so, another reason this is sort of a personalized choice)And here is a big one - NEW game support... so far, the 3DS has the Vita beat... granted, it had a head start (and it actually was a little slow going and many wondered if the support would turn out to be poor for the3DS, but now it's picked up and looking good). Regardless of the 3DS's headstart the Vita has been out for awhile and I'm not seeing the support I thought I would. Yes, you can download all the PSP games, PS classics, etc., but you can do that on the PSP, too. As far as new game support, the Vita is really lacking so far and given the time it's been out I think there should be more... we can only hope it picks up, as I said, the 3DS had a slow start, too. The 3DS has new and classic downloadable options, too - I'll discuss that under the VITA as well. I'm really pleased with the classic NES and SNES games they've chosen to release for download, too... games like Punch Out, Metroid, Zelda, Super Mario Bros., etc. etc., and some awesome titles that aren't as \"high profile\" like the original Kid Icarus and Bionic Commando - both awesome games. The 3DS has 2 screens, a touch screen and a top screen, which is really a personal \"pro,\" as many may prefer the one larger screen of the Vita. Though no 3G, the 3DS offers the cool street pass/spot pass feature (which works with games and videos), which the vita has a version of that is not nearly as good.Obviously, the 3DS has the 3D, no glasses needed technology. Though I'm basically a proponent for the 3DS in this review, I have to admit, I find it a little gimmicky and have not seen it used in any really cool ways except to give me a headache.Also, the 3DS is a sturdy machine... The DS lite or DSi didn't feel flimsy, but the 3DS is solid... it feels like if you dropped it (I don't recommend of course) it would withstand the force. It's nice for your gadgets to feel well built. It comes with a cool docking station for charging, although you can also charge directly, and I didn't have to buy a new carrying case for it, it fits nicely in my DSi one, though I did purchase a hardshell cover (the DSi covers will obviously not fit the 3DS).The camera's have more functionality/can do more on the 3DS than on the VITA, as it has three, an inner and 2 outer which allow you to take \"3D\" pics and videos. Pretty cool.VITA PROS OVER THE 3DS: However... I give Sony kudos for not rushing to get their system out pre-holiday just to make the money, and I know if I had bought the 3DS when it first came out at 300 bucks, I would be P.O.'ed and probably feel like I should have waited and either got the Vita with its perks for that price, or waited until the 3DS price went down by over 130 dollars and bought it then HAD I KNOWN - I don't blame a lot of people for feeling had - I don't know if Nintendo shamefully planned it that way (i.e. got the consumers before the holiday at a higher price because they knew they'd pay it since it was the only new \"hot\" handheld on the market and available for Christmas gifting, then lowered the MSRP when the Vita came out to have a price based competitive edge)... it could be, but it also could be that it wasn't selling well enough and they realized a drop in price was necessary.... I haven't done enough economic research to have insight into their motives. Regardless, I'd feel duped if I had bought it early at full price.Anyway, the Vita has the edge on online gaming given the 3G data plan option (although the 3DS does have the cool street pass element, as did the DSi, and you can online game with the 3DS via its own wifi), and the 3G Vita system is worth it for $50 more if you ever want to use that feature. The Vita is on top graphically (though the 3DS in my opinion is still a nice system with some decent specs in this respect, but to me, the \"3D\" thing is still a gimmick and not really that much of a pro for 3DS), and finally the Vita is also on top regarding non-gaming functions/apps - especially Skype is a big plus in my opinion - I figure though, if you have an iPhone or an Android, which have come way down in price and a lot more folks can afford them, although its nice to have them on say a Vita, you really don't need to have a lot of the apps on your handheld portable game system that you probably already have on your phone with a data plan (which have also become more reasonable in price and sometimes included in certain packages). Again, the Vita blows the 3DS away in apps though... I downloaded a cool metronome app and a guitar/instrument tuner on my 3DS, the browser app comes standard, but most of the additional apps available are calender type things and apps that enhance the camera abilities more... If you want apps on your portable gaming system, Vita all the way. The Vita has more downloadalbe games, but, like I mentioned before, right now most of those games are the same games that you can download and play on the PSP, so, if you hold on to your PSP like I have, you can get those same PS classics and PSP games that are the majority of what is available for download on the Vita, currently.Video wise, both have Netflix app. However, as far as watching downloaded via, say, for instance, videos you put on your SD card, the VITA has the 3DS blown away, so, if you want to use your handheld to watch videos outside of Netflix, Vita is the one. Even the older PSP is great for watching videos outside of just the UMDs - you can download videos from Playstation Network for cheap prices (all kinds of stuff) for both PSP and Vita, and you can also put them on your SD card for view. There are way more videos available for download via the Playstation Network than the 3DS, and with the 3DS, there is really nothing except videos about gaming. Also, you can't put videos on your SD card and watch them (*exception: there are some PC apps available to reformat, for instance, AVI files, to put on your SD card and make them playable on the 3DS. So far, though, as far as my research goes, they cannot exceed 10 minutes in length... so, no movies, not even a full TV episode. The SD card that comes with the 3DS is only 2 Gigs. You can get a larger one but that doesn't get around the 10 minute thing. So the only option for videos on the 3DS is Netflix, videos up to 10 minutes if you go through the reformatting trouble, and dumb video game video downloads... I've heard of a hack to watch YouTube videos via the Internet connection despite no Flash support (read on) but haven't figured it out yet). Also, and this is pretty big, the Vita's browser supports Flash, the 3DS does not. So, little to no video support (unless its an animated GIF, I suppose) on the browser. A big mistake, in my mind, on Nintendo's part... I mean, how hard would it had been to program in a browser that supports flash?? Ridiculous. Included in the apps that the Vita has and the 3DS doesn't is a simple MP3 player. You can't really use the 3DS as a music player - even the original PSP can be used as an MP3 player and depending on your SD card size hold tons of songs.COMPARABLE FEATURES: Some ways in which the Vita and the 3DS are comparable are both systems have WiFi ofcourse, offer Netflix, both have comparable cameras (the 3DS has three cameras, two outer, one inner: one of the outer is for taking \"3D\" photos and video, so you can capture both photos and video on the 3DS with a firmware update for the video, and apps, mini games and purchasable games take advantage of the 3D camera, so the 3DS actually has the Vita here). The Vita also captures photos and video and has a photo and video editor app. As far as the internet browser, both have a comparable one, outside of the lack of any Flash capability on 3ds's Linux based one. They both have portable storage via SD cards. Both have touch screens. Both systems come with the circle pad above the cross pad - the Vita has two, one left and one right, but there is an available accessory for the 3DS that adds the circular controller on the right.FINAL TAKE ON 3DS versus VITA: For me, it was a highly personal choice in terms of what I wanted out of a handheld system. The 3DS, at a much cheaper price, has good and seemingly growing game support, downloadable games which include classics (Punch Out and Metroid on a handheld... how awesome is that for the old school gamer?!), has the apps I want, like Netflix and a browser, voice recorder, and other cool stuff (like the instrument tuner for my guitar) with the exception of skype that the Vita has, which I would have liked but can do on my Android with my free data plan. It also had the functions I wanted - a camera capable of taking video and photos and a video editor app, an SD card for storage so I can, for instance, transfer those photos and video over to my PC. I was able to trade in my DSi since it plays all the DS games, and since I went the 3DS route, I kept my PSP which, as I mentioned before has a good number of the functions that the VITA offers (I'm not saying the Vita isn't a huge upgrade from the PSP, I was just recapping things stated before... e.g. that I can still download PSP and classic games on the PSP, and as another recap I'm also still able to play my UMD discs on something). No Flash player on the browser on 3DS is plain lame, and the lack of video support on the 3DS stinks, but I can watch videos on my PSP, and use Netflix on the 3DS... as well as watch videos on my phone with a 32 gig SD card. The cameras, again, have more functionality on the 3DS. Worst 3DS cons (for me): No Flash support (What?!), terrible video support, and no skype despite having 3 stinking cameras, and no MP3 player which can be found on both the PSP and Vita! Let's just hope Nintendo steps up and offers an upgrade that will offer a skype app since its got all the hardware, as well as a flash upgrade to offer more video support, and perhaps even a mp3 app.3DS CONCLUSION: Despite some negative reviews, I think the 3DS is good system. It's not a gigantic leap from the DSi, but when you weigh the price and the features, the 3DS is a nice overall value. Its 3D capabilities may be a little disappointing, but I think it makes up for it in new games and other features, such as the 3D camera, Netflix etc. As an RPG buff, I'm just hoping for some more support there, esp. turn based.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}

Mario Ware Inc where you can use a multi link to play as either Wario or Mario and play Mario games like Super Mario brothers but in either Mario or Wario versions. I think that would be cool.

While most of it is cross-platform with the Xbox 360, there is always that one game that I haven't tried that I would love to play. Naturally one of the big PS3 titles is the latest in the Ratchet and Clank series, a platformer series that I will admit I never bothered trying in the past. While I'm still not that big into platformers, I have to admit I quite enjoyed Tools of Destruction and makes for a great playthrough.Story: The story finds the duo being hunted by Emperor Tachyon and everywhere they go, there seems to always be someone who are trying to take the two down. So they both go across the galaxy to figure out not only why Tachyon wants them dead so badly but other reasons which may have to do with Ratchet's race, the Lombaxes. As well, Clank seems to have a strange connection with an alien trible known as the Zoni.Graphics: Tools of Destruction is one of those kind of games that if people were to watch you play, they'd most likely crowd around the TV and watch because the graphics here are stellar. From the bright and vivid (not to mention sharp) color palette to the worlds you traverse, it's an incredibly great looking title and there's barely any hint of slowdown or drop in framerate either.Sound/Music: Anyone hooked up to a sound system will have plenty to like here since the sound is grand and orchestral and really comes to life and makes the worlds seem that much immersive. While it's not a catchy score per se, it more than does the job. Ditto with the voice acting which is also well done and doesn't suffer from that ironic tone voice actors sometimes use where they have to ham it up on a line. Even the Zoni have awesome voices and make one remember the aliens from the \"Toy Story\" movies.Gameplay: To be honest, I'm not that into platformers. Whereas ones like the Prince of Persia series are favorites, it's that sort-of run-and-gun feel that I never bought into. But what makes R&C; fun is just how easy it is to get into and upon fiddling a bit with sensitivity and camera options, it was a breeze to get into. The weapons are customizable for better damage, more ammo and the like and the variety found makes killing enemies dare I say it, fun. From a device that shoots bees to a tornado launcher or missile lock and even items that make the enemies start dancing, it's fun just to switch weapons on the go and use whatever you want on them.The puzzles aren't really all that difficult and it's really just a case of using your brains to solve them and not having to pause just to try and figure it out. On occasion you'll have some moments that fully use the Sixaxis controller like when you freefall and dodge traffic or missiles to flying through the air or lasering out walls. Unfortunately, I could never really get the hang of it and while they weren't as awful as say, Lair, I still just switched to the trusty analog stick. Another gripe is the checkpoint system; dying is not frustrating in a Ninja Gaiden way but when you get sent back it was kind of surprising just how far back I was sent and you felt like \"oh come on, they're sending me back THIS far?\" While I'd get to where I needed to be eventually, it was annoying feeling a sense of progression and having to reload back in the field instead of the cave/dungeon I just recently entered.With extras like skill points, challenge modes, different fights to take on in an Arena, plus upgrading your weapons to max, there's plenty to do once you're finished. Also it's just so much fun and this one's well worth your time (also if you can get online and order from the PS Store, download the next installment \"Quest for Booty\").","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2008"}

I am not even sure why, but the Event Horizon-like setting caught my eye.And this game has a lot of good things going for it. I like the art style. They do a very good job at conveying the idea that you are in a giant and abandoned space ship. It is a little scary at times. Some people say there isn't enough variety in the levels since it is all the same space ship, but I don't mind that. It creates an overall experience that works and it is consistant.Also, the way all the interaction and the UI (or the lack of a UI) works is great. Everything you do, you do in game. Never goes the game go into \"play a video\" mode, but instead, the character brings up a holographic screen that hovers in front of him, even while you keep moving around. The same goes for the inventory, and so forth.I also like the weapons which are unusual. I like the upgrade system. It provides more depth than you would expect for this type of game.So what's wrong? Well, unfortunately a lot of the things that frustrated you in games 10 years ago and seem to have generally been fixed are back in this game. The overall controls are very very sluggish. At all times, you feel like the character just isn't quite doing what you want him to do. And he moves sooooo slow! Turning around takes forever. \"Running\" is probably slower than the average human walks. Except here, scary monsters are after you. But the avatar doesn't seem to care.One of the things I really hated in this game is the lack of ammo. I see that they are trying to make things more suspenseful with that, but it just doesn't work. You always only have a few shots and you can never experiement with your weapon. And when you run out of ammo, you have to deal with awful hand-to-hand combat. At that point you might as well reload. And health is another problem too. If your health runs down to far and you have no helath packs, you just know that you can't proceed much further, and there is nothing you can do about it.Also, some animations take forever to finish and there is nothing you can do about it. Accidentally bring up the inventory in a fight and you are toast, because it takes forever to close it down (or at least longer than it takes to get killed).So as a conclusion: I am angry at this game! Angry, because it does so many things right. It creates fantastic athmosphere. It creates a fantasticly immersive UI experience. And then they messed it all up with the controls and the choice of not giving you ammo. Argh!!!!Note: If you do not have an HD-TV, then I really can't recommend this game, since you will not be able to read anything on screen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2008"}

This game literally had me wanting to throw my controller through my TV half the time. Wet is the story of a problem fixer named ruby voiced nicely by Eliza Dushku. She takes jobs to eliminate targets and get caught in a war between two drug lords. The characters and art styles of the game were interesting this game reminded me of Max Payne. The problem is Max Payne was better and it came out what 8 years ago. The aiming for this shooter is a bit dated what saves it is that when you jump slide or shoot time is slowed down and ruby always lock on one target with her duel weapons allowing you to mow down enemies. In fact if you aren't jumping or sliding or something you'll be dead soon. This works fine in combat and its fun. However the numerous bugs and glitches wear your patience thin by the 3rd level and things keep sliding down from there. I died a ton of times trying to jump from ledges due to poor camera and touchy controls. There were numerous sequences that really pissed me off. First there was this spot where you fell from a plane that must have took me about an hour and half to master. Then there was an area were you had to slide under a door and shoot 2 locks on each side to progress the auto aim is random and I found this task to be harder than it should have. The game is very fast paced and has a nice style its too bad they were so sloppy with its design. My advice is to pass or rent it. Don't buy it though, it's short and frustrating as hell.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

Of course there were moments I get pissed at how the designers didn't quite think about everything when they were making the game...a few glitches here and there (walking inbetween a wall and trash can may instantly kill you, etc), but overall I give this game 9/10 on the fun factor.  You have the freedom of Grand Theft Auto with superpowers that makes spiderman look like a tea sipping grandma.Pros:  I love the originality of the entire story, the characters & voices, even the nice twists in plot-line and karma-based choices at every turn.  I knew since I played Mass Effect on the PC that karma-based games were on the way.  Anyway, the programmers fixed quite a few bugs since the first one and added some badly needed skills that allow you to really scale buildings.  The ability to pick up and throw cars is probably my favorite, you can really cause some havoc!  I'm definitely impressed with how this one has turned out.  If you enjoy shooters and GTA-style or BMX games, you'll love Infamous 1 & 2.The ONLY reason I don't give this game full props is the game itself falls short of being about 8 hours long.  When you can beat a game within two days (not playing it non-stop), then I think they maybe could have added more storyline/gameplay.  The one counter-point to that fact is after you beat the game your character becomes playable free-style so you can run around and do whatever you want.  The online missions are interesting, you can create and play anything player-made.Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

Bethesda graphics and character physics are a little unique in and of themselves, they take a little getting used to but I think you'll end up liking them for the most part.  The game was also a little slow getting started for me with very little tutorial as to what all of the options you have are and what they mean.  My basic break down...Pros:-The graphics a pretty.  Not the best but they still look really good.-The weapon choices are astronomical.  You can use just about anything you can pickup, which is just about anything.  You can even build your own weapons and maintain them for top quality.  I like that the weapon declines in time and hurts the amount of damage you do as well as your accuracy.-S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a cool system of stats-I love games where you can search dead bodies as well as pick pocket live ones.-decent quests with a HUGE map area.  Approximately 16 SQ miles according to creators-good character interaction and dialog with a choice based system that does affect how people interact with you.-Fast map travel around the wasteland.Cons:-VATS...kind of a pro but more con because, if YOU CHOOSE to use the VATS system that so many people whine about, you cannot skip the slow motion while other enemies still attack you.  Plus it can definitely cheapen the game play experience if you're more of a 1st person shooter fan rather than an RPG gamer.-Very little tutorial on the stats so they can be pretty confusing for a while.-The wasteland can take very long periods of time to walk around with sometimes very little enemy interaction...a littel on the boring side at times.-The night to day effect is awesome...unless you are waiting for shops to reopen and you don't have a place to sleep.Overall Bethesda did a great job and seemed to put a lot of thought into this game.  It's a little difficult to get in to for the casual gamer like myself.  But I love RPGs and RPG/FPSs like KOTOR, Mass Effect, Jade Empire, Bio Shock and Fable.  So far I have yet to be let down by this game, it's been a good play to the point that I am at.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Excellent racing title - A Single Player Perspective","reviewText":"I'll start by saying that I have never played this or Forza 2 online.  My online experience is limited to Call of Duty.  If you're looking for a review of the controversial multiplayer mode, there are plenty of good ones from other gamers.That said, in single player mode this game is amazing.  Not perfect, but very, very good.  I absolutely loved Forza 2, so I was concerned that Turn 10 might alter the new game in ways that would be frustrating.  Well, they did...but they made up for it (mostly) with lots of great new features.  I am a hard-core driving simulator enthusiast; except on the most frustrating factory stock races, I play everything with the AI difficulty on \"hard,\" stability control off, and manual transmission mode.  Despite this, Turn 10 has provided options to make the game EVEN HARDER or considerably easier.  In fact, this is one of the biggest new feature sets, which allows a player with just about any level of experience to set the game up to their liking.  While I won't use things like \"autobraking\" or the recommended racing line, I don't have to.Of course, Forza is all about cars, and Forza 3 delivers tons of them.  Counting the DLC, which keeps coming out, there are well over 400.  Chances are, unless you are a huge fan of Japanese \"kei\" cars or obscure pre-war European roadsters from long-disbanded manufacturers, you will find your favorite automobile in this game.  (Gran Turismo should cover you in the cases I mentioned).Forza 3 also improves upon Forza 2 with its selection of tracks.  The classics are still here (including my favorite Maple Valley) and with lots of new details thanks to the improved graphics, but new tracks debut as well, including the beautiful and extensive Amalfi Coast and the fictional series of Spanish tracks billed as \"Camino Viejo de Montserrat.\"  Additionally, the gorgeous Fujimi Kaido from Forza 1 makes a reappearance.Forza 2 had tons of customization, and Forza 3 has even more.  While everything is just about the same, there are a few new things you can do such as adding oil coolers.  On the other hand, it has also been simplified a bit; you can't choose what brand of tires you install, for example.Gameplay is just as good as before, with an improved physics engine that allows rollovers.  The graphics are phenomenal, each car is exquisitely detailed, and there is a full cockpit view from which you can drive.  If you are an extreme hard-core racer, you can even choose to drive with a button for the clutch.  This is beyond me because in real life I use feet to operate the gas, brake, and clutch while my hands can concentrate on steering and shifting.  Doing it all with my hands is too confusing.Now, the negatives.  No game is perfect, and Forza 3 has its share of flaws.  The first thing that annoyed me was the \"race announcer.\"  He won't shut up.  His bass-rich, nostalgic easy-listening voice can be heard any time you try to enter a car into a race for which it doesn't qualify (which I often do in order to quickly see which ones I own that DO qualify).Another big problem is the acquisition of cars.  In Forza 2, you got cars for leveling up via XP, and you received a car for each race series you won.  In Forza 3, you do get cars for leveling up, but you stop leveling up about 1/4 of the way through the game; meanwhile, winning race series only gives you money...not enough money.  I decided that I wanted to own all the cars in the game, since I did pay real money for this opportunity to virtually drive them, and so with 3/4 of the races completed, I tallied up the cars remaining and found I still needed $110,000,000 to buy them all.  Considering that a typical, mid-length race at my advanced level of difficulty only nets about $18,000, that was going to take a while.  Part of this is due to a single vintage Ferrari priced at $20,000,000.  The cars are just too expensive.  It's my own fault for wanting them all, but hey, I should be able to do that.In their attempt to make the game appeal to a wider range of players, Turn 10 also added some unnecessary drama.  There is an entirely repetitive animation at the beginning of each race depicting your car rolling up to the line and revving its engine.  While they do stick to realism here (old cars with soft suspension will bounce when they stop at the line), the revving is tacky, and more critically, it removes your opportunity to bring your RPMs to the correct level for a good launch.  A successful launch off the line is often the key to getting ahead of rivals who may be hard to pass elsewhere.  Forza 3 made this impossible, which is extremely ridiculous considering that an all-new race type is drag racing.  The launch is the MOST critical part of a drag race!!The rewind feature has drawn some criticism from die-hard gamers, but I think it's good.  You really don't have to use it, but I certainly have.  It's easier than restarting a race (which takes a long while) and in long, tedious races it can save you a ton of headaches.  However, it doesn't always work.  Seriously.  Sometimes, when you need it most, it just isn't an option.  The most notable time for me was in the third-to-last lap of an endurance race.  At the end of the long straight, I got incredibly distracted by something else (perhaps my own thoughts) and failed to brake.  Instead of immediately braking and swerving when I realized this, I moved my hand so that I could hit the rewind button.  It did nothing, and by the time I figured that out and got back to the brakes, my car had covered the sand beyond the track and smacked the wall, wrecking its front.  Fortunately, the engine was OK, and I still won the race, but it's good to know you can't always rely on the rewind button.The addition of lousy in-game music is simply a waste of disc space (which is an issue, since you have to install almost 2GB of data on your hard drive in order to play all of the game).Overall, Forza 3 makes some great improvements (rollovers, more cars, awesome graphics, new tracks) over its predecessor, but it is not perfect.  However, it does allow novice and experienced racers alike to jump in and play, and completing the game will take hundreds of hours, making it just as much of a total immersive long-haul experience as its prior installments.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

This is the best game in the Fable series. I can't believe some of the stuff that they did that made Fable III the great game that it is.This was my first pre-order ever, and it was a perfect game to start. Fable III has great story, great graphics, great physics and so much more that is great!The new spell system is awesome, you wear gauntlets that allow you to channel the will power inside of you. You can also now \"weave\" spells together to make a combo-spell that effects the enemies 2 ways, e.g. Don't like just burning guys? Don't like just zap'n em? Do both!I love the new \"Gooey\" system, no more 2D lists to choose your weapons from, now you go to a place called the sanctuary to change your weapons, clothing, etc.Weapon modifying works better than I had hoped, the weapons really change according to how you use them.New interacting with AIs is amazing to say the least, holding hands brings a new element to Fable. You know that time in Fable II when you someone to follow you but they got scared of you or didn't want to follow? Well now you can just grab'm and drag'm.You can now interact with people online better. You can become business partners with people online, you can even marry them (in the game of course)!Very good choice of voices. To list just some of them: John Cleese (Monty Python, James Bond, Harry Potter, Shrek 1,2 and 3, The Pink Panther 2, and more!), Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, and more!), Zoe Wanamaker (Harry Potter, My Family, and more!), Sir Ben Kingsley (Fear Is the Key, Gandhi, Without a Clue, and more!), and many more!And now a say on the Limited Edition. I am happy to say that they did NOT cut anything out like they had to in Fable II because of cost. I love the extra things that come with the Limited Edition.The special coin looks very like a coin out of Fable and can be helpful for that neutral character you have for deciding to take the good choice or the evil choice (you can use a regular coin I guess but this one looks cooler!).The deck of cards are very nice and look like the virtual cards in Fable II pub games in the old paper look and show a lot of different character possibilities.The \"book\" that you keep the game in is very nice looking and keeps the game, coin and cards safe. The book is real, faux leather-bound. A magnet keeps the cover on and another keeps the \"secret drawer\" closed. The \"secret drawer\" is where your special stuff is. You open the top and there's your game, but where is the extras? Pull the bottom down and there is a drawer that holds you stuff.The \"book\" can also be covered with the cardboard sleeve. It has the Fable III logo on top, the picture on the front, details on the back and a smashed chicken on the bottom (no really!).The code for the extras are great; a new quest, that I won't spoil, new location (where you get a great house that never falls into disrepair), a unique outfit, new weapons and a new boxer dog breed!The Limited Edition is way worth the extra money.I am so happy that this game lived up to it's hype and to the Fable name. I am looking forward for every Fable game to come. If there were a hundred star rating this game would have it. Thank you so much for the next perfect game, in the perfect series Lionhead.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"How do you make an already awesome hardcore gaming series even better? Like this.","reviewText":"Back in the late 80's/early 90's, there were few names in gaming as beloved and hardcore as Mega Man. Time after time, Mega Man's games on the NES proved to be masterworks in hardcore gaming, and that classic series continued to stay on the NES even after the Super Nintendo was released. Then, in 1993/1994, Capcom introduced to the world a new kind of Mega Man to grace the more powerful system, and the gaming world would once again never be the same. Much like the classic Mega Man series, the X series would continue producing awesome hardcore gaming experiences for years to come (although it's definitely not as consistently excellent as the classic series, unfortunately). In traditional Capcom fashion, they produced a ton of X games, and now they've rereleased the first six onto a disc for your gaming pleasure, and what a pleasure it is.The X series, from its very inception, was meant to advance the Mega Man name into a more hardcore direction, and it most definitely succeeded. Of course, the main gameplay retains the classic Mega Man formula. You go after 8 bosses with their own unique stage, you take on a final fortress series of levels, you gain new abilities and weapons from your vanquished foes, it's all about tight platforming and running and gunning, and so on and so worth. However, it's not just classic Mega Man with an \"X\" at the end of the title. New moves, health upgrades, and Light capsules that hold armor upgrades for X are attributes first introduced in Mega Man X, and quickly became series' mainstay elements. In later X titles, you could play the game as Zero, who utilized a totally different style of play with his melee-centric Z-saber focus and a \"Weapon Get\" system that totally differs from X's and is very unique. I love playing as both characters. They're both about as good as it gets when it comes to 2-D action platforming.I love the story behind the Mega Man X series and this paragraph will be somewhat of a tangent about it. Much like the gameplay, the story took the Mega Man name into more mature, complex themes that resonate with gamers of all ages. It takes place 100 years after the events of the classic Mega Man games, and features a new cast of characters, villains, and a very different type of conflict. The story in this series often explores themes of betrayal, loyalty to your brethren, the philosophical implications of freewill in machines, and war itself. It's all quite awesome. The main character is X (the new Mega Man), and he has a whole cast of great support characters, including his greatest comrade and close friend Zero, who also becomes playable in later X titles in this collection. It's all great. I love the charming and fun aspects of the classic series, but the X series just appeals to me more from a narrative perspective. Each game has a fairly different story too. No \"Wily was behind Cossack/fakeProtoMan/Mr.X the whole time!!!\" stories, and I quite like that. Sigma may be the main villain in each X game, but X4 is a great example of moral complexity and ambiguity that makes the overall plot quite compelling. The whole notion that the absolute evil you face, Sigma, was once the greatest hero in the world, and that Zero, one of the most awesome heroes, was once evil and Dr. Wily's last and greatest creation, is just fantastic. X1, X4, and X5 are personal highlights, for me, when it comes to the plot. Great stuff.The quality of the collection itself is quite awesome. The controls have always been very tight, and thankfully this collection really does work well on the PS2 and Gamecube both. I personally prefer the PS2 controller's d-pad, shoulder buttons, and overall button arrangement, but both are great to play (I personally own both versions). There aren't nearly as many extras on this one as theclassic Mega Man Anniversary Collection, but there are some such as unlockable artwork, as well as a PSX Mario/Crash Bandicoot Kart racing clone with Mega Man, which is quite a lot of zany fun. All-in-all, a stellar job at compiling it all together, and of course, the core X titles are what make this collection a must-own.If you fancy yourself a classic gamer who loves action titles, then it really doesn't get much better than Mega Man X. Sure, there are some weaker entries in the series (I personally am not fond of 3, and 6 is downright atrocious, in my opinion), but overall, the Mega Man X collection is a fantastic package of multiple gaming masterpieces that must be played. I really cannot recommend it enough. Any hardcore gamer will love this series. So buy it, go to war against the Mavericks who would rob the world of peace, and put an end to Sigma's evil, twisted ambitions!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.

Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

For the majority of the game there is nothing special about the graphics or scenery at all.Enemies-  There are some enemies that attack you and kill you with one shot.  That is not a big deal but the thing is this happens unexpectedly a lot and this forces you to do a lot of trial and error to figure out what to do because you die from hidden or invisible enemies.  This isn't fun.  Also the death sequence is not short and it never varies, which makes it even more frustrating... not fun.  Also, you run across the same enemies a lot.  Not much variety.The bosses are big and bad, that's cool. But they don't FEEL very threatening or special.  Some are epic but some are just big but somewhat boring.Weapons-  Okay here is my biggest issue with this game.  The weapons are NOT interesting at all.  They are basic and VERY FEW OPTIONS.  Seriously, there are like 4 main weapons to pick from.  I felt like there was no real need to change most of the time.  It just made things boring.  They only give you something special right before a boss or before you need to do some special task.  Come on Insomniac!  You can do better than this!Health- You get hit, there shines red on the screen, you take cover til you hear \"Phew\", then continue.  This is boring to me.  I would much rather have heath kits than this as this ads some edge to the game play.Story-  Not bad, but not that interesting either.  It is just... meh.  I found myself slowly losing interest in pushing forward.  At first I really wanted to see what was going to happen, but slowly I found I was just doing it to get my rental monies worth despite the frustrations.Multiplayer Online-  I don't like doing multiplayer so I have no review on this part.  If you like that then this may be the game for you.After a while I just didn't care to continue the story and put Borderlands back in.  Borderlands left me wanting to play more.  While Resistance2 just let me wanting to take it back to Blockbuster.It doesn't SUCK by any means, but it's just not all that appealing either.  Not worth the price they are asking for it, though after this rental I think I won't be playing this again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2010"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

It's that good!If you take a moment to reflect on the ACTUAL game, and not dumb people's first impressions, you will find a game worthy of the series.People complained and complained how HARD the other NG games were, and now that they've done work to cater to these people, they are still getting dumped onby the other camp. So now who's happy?The production value and presentation are top notch and worthy of a top team like Team Ninja. Is this the ultimate NG? No. But you can rest assured it's a solid entryin the series, and only makes me want more NG games.Hopefully they will get back to the meat of the NG universe with the next entry, but for now....... NINJA GAIDEN 3 FILLS THE SEAT SATISFYINGLY.And for those who say Ryu is different, try and understand where they are taking the character. It's not a totally different Ryu, just seeing a different side of him.5 stars, a top notch game that will hopefully receive a Black/Sigma version.Highly recommended!ps.

This is a first-rate science-fiction game and is loads of fun!As a shooter, this game rocks! It starts off kind of slow, but really picks up as you progress further into the story. Some of the later battles are truly awesome. These late battles are really long and you will earn victory the hard way. A player's shooting skills are really put to the test. However, it is not hard, and a lot of fun!This is one immersive game. There are short cutscenes in every chapter. They draw you in. I found myself playing just to see what happens next in the story! It is a good story, with a few twists and turns compared to the average shooter. Very nice.The graphics are pretty good. At first, I thought they were only so-so, but they are, in fact, quite nice. Environments are well rendered, and the enemy Chimera have never looked this good. Cutscenes are seemlessly interwoven into the game, and the entire game uses the same graphics capability, whether it is a cutscene or normal play.Sound is pretty good. I turned sound effects to maximum to get the best sound out of weapons fire. Explosions and enemy deaths are well done. The background music is both ominous and foreboding, and plays differently during the battles; when you finish off the all enemies the music will change. The music is also just right for this apocalyptic setting. Again, very nice.Gun play is excellent, the best in the series. Each gun is useful, and there are some neat varieties, as well. Also, you have all the weapons you have picked up, so pick and choose whatever method of destruction you desire. All of the weapons are very nice indeed.I thought at first that I would not like the way healing is handled. Health kits are needed to heal. However, the play is just right. There are times, in some battles, where you run around frantically looking for a health pack. Not that it is crucial. Usually, there is a lull in the battle as you are running-n-gunning while you look for that ever-needed health restore. In the end, the way healing is handled is a plus for this game.This is an Epic game. Sony really put a lot of effort into this game. The credits are very long! I clocked in 9.5 hours playing this game, as some of the later battles require good tactics to wade through. Resistance 3 is one heck of a shooter!There are not many boss battles; those are found in Resistance 2. The few boss battles in the game are new and refreshing and tons of fun! I really liked what was included in Resistance 3 for the boss battles. They are neat and innovative, not frustrating at all. In the end, just shoot!Resistance 3 is a top-quality game. The levels are well designed, and the play is fantastic! This Exclusive science-fiction shooter is well worth playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

There are six characters and only one (sonic) is decent. Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.The Sonic level's, which should have been the entire game, are plagued with a broken camera (it was on crack, sometimes it would focus inside a wall) and bugs. The boss battles are way to easy, and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself (I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible). Plus the sonic story is super short. I didn't really like the other game stories.In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly. The camera and bugs are even worse here.The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.In Knuckles level's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome.In Amy's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer, it gets old very fast.I save the worst for last Big the cat. His levels are just a fishing mini-game. There's nothing special at all, just a boring fishing game, way to go sonic team.Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters, and when you do get to play as sonic, it's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun.

continues the rockstar tradition of effective plotting, exceptional voice and action acting, magnificent virtual world creation, and (usually) fun action challenges. the basic plot -- john marston, a former outlaw and gunslinger, is coerced by evil government agents to do their dirty work out in the wild west, only to be betrayed by them and later avenged -- allows for quite a lot of subplots and side action (bounty hunts, criminal hideout shootouts, treasure hunts, big game hunts, etc.), and the variety of locales, characters, geography and wildlife (human and otherwise) is impressive. i am a big fan of the open world, \"sand box\" format, and \"red dead\" is a very rewarding environment to explore.i haven't given this game a full five star recommendation for seven reasons:1. the game has the greatest proportion of programming bugs of any videogame i have played. the fault seems evenly to lie with the a.i. and physics programmers, but quality assurance and game testers also let a lot go by. the most serious was a full controller freeze during the \"cowards die many times\" episode, which required rebooting the player; then the player could not find my saved files and had to be rebooted again. but there was also the six minute long episode during a bounty hunt when the video suddenly began playing at half speed (sound was unaffected); this disappeared as soon as marston got on a horse. and there were dozens of creepy possession episodes, for example wagons and stage coaches that shook violently and loudly in place, and could not be moved, or marston's wife coming to bed and resting her heels on the mattress, the rest of her body levitating horizontally above the floor; objects floating in mid air; the gun carried by a character mysteriously moving through the air, because the character carrying the gun was invisible; horses that leaped 20 feet into the air (over a train); a stage coach that jumped over a bridge and into a river, poker players seated four feet from the poker table ... most of this occurred during the middle third of the game. but add to that the horses constantly scurrying past with the frantic affect of large insects, and the cumulative effect was creepy and annoying.2. the action capabilities of the rockstar figures are well past their prime. we are stuck in the laura croft era animation where characters collide with walls or closed doors and then moonwalk in place, cannot perform even simple physical tasks like sitting down or picking up objects (all that has to be handled with brief cut scenes), cannot leap over objects or climb up anything more complex than a ladder. staffage figures walk or ride into each other or get stuck in a.i. loops that cause them to leap onto furniture or jitter between competing frame sequences ... worst of all is the \"action\" mode that kicks in during fight episodes, when the marston figure automatically moves twice as fast and the controller becomes much more sensitive, making marston much clumsier to maneuver. on all these points, the uniform and flexible action capabilities of other recent games, in particular \"assassin's creed ii\", make an unflattering comparison.3. i felt that the facial motion capture and animation was somewhat improved over \"grand theft auto 4\", but as i got into the game i began to think not. most of the improvement was limited to the key characters in the game -- the incidental figures had that old waxy look -- and might have been because the figures spent more time in daylight. either way, you have to look at these faces for a cumulative 30 or 40 hours of play. can't someone at least make the skin look more natural?4. although the basic plot line is generally well done, the game drags at a few points, in particular the \"return home\" where marston is draying corn, herding cows, roping mustangs, shooting crows and \"bonding\" with his son or arguing pointlessly and annoyingly with old \"uncle\" or his shrewish wife. the depth this gave to the character and the story was very welcome: as in \"assassin's creed ii\", we're seeing videogames evolve into cinematic storytelling and true character development. the problem is that these episodes were motivated as \"chores\", and did not add up to visible improvements in the ranch or the mood of its habitants. marston had already killed over 100 people to get his farm and family back, so it was disappointing that neither he nor his family seemed very happy to be there.5. and speaking of chores: videogame plotting still has not solved the basic motivational problem of what the main character does and why he does it. he has no inner life. which means that pretty much anybody can order marston around, give him a chore or make him a dare. in particular, females and criminals seem to have the most hero influence in the fantasy world of videogames, which is truly weird, because after the female bosses the hero around for a while, the hero then turns on a dime, picks up a gun, and handily defeats a legion of attackers. worse, the rockstar player management system involves a variety of in game symbols for where to go next, *and* text instructions that tell you exactly what to do (\"capture the thief,\" \"climb the wall,\" \"shoot the lock\"). there is absolutely no context ambiguity left for the player to solve, which completely wastes the openness of the sand box game format.6. the \"tutorials\" for game specific skills or situations, such as how to \"draw\" during a gunfight, rope a horse or use the \"red dead\" time slowdown, appear inconveniently as text instructions in the upper left corner of the screen: as you read your opponent in the gunfight has drawn his gun or the horse has run and, well, tutorial over. worse, you cannot retrieve the text via a help or tutorial menu. again, other games handle the tutorials as narrated instructions, and provide an in game resource to review them or practice them as wanted. put \"help\" in the menu, not on the screen!7. really? do i need 17 or 18 different weapons? the basics are: fists, rope, knife, pistol, rifle, shotgun. but we get six different kinds of rifles, three kinds of shotgun, three different pistols, throwing knives, firebombs, dynamite ... all managed with the standard \"selection wheel\" *plus* within item toggle menu. this detracts from the realism, and becomes an encumbrance when it's necessary to switch from one item to another during combat. let marston change weapons in his room, or using the saddlebags ... but don't make him carry 18 weapons all the time ... it makes him noisy in the dark.i have two quibbles:8. with all the painstaking care, art and sheer genius that has gone into texturing, sculpting, drawing and lighting this beautiful virtual world, why is everyone at rockstar so completely ignorant about the sky? the moon is drawn at the size it would appear if it were only 12,000 miles from earth, and the night sky is a gibberish of stars. the game \"far cry 2\" (for example) painted the sky as it actually appears, and the effect was lovely in the wilderness setting.9. and finally ... what's with putting the actors and voice talent credits at the *end* of the game credits? by that time my video monitor and game controller are in sleep mode. yes, the testers are nice hardworking people, and it looks impressive to list so many of them on the screen, but the acting talent is in the eye and ear of the player almost every second of the game. it's simply bizarre to rank them below everyone else.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2010"}

While this is somewhat true, I found this description to be exaggerated.  This game is in no way as hard or as fun as they are advertising.IMO Demon's Souls looks and plays like the 3rd person mode of Fallout 3 (and I assume Elder Scrolls).  You will be walking a lot, picking items (that you cannot sell if you do not need them), and fighting enemies scattered throughout the levels.  Combat against standard enemies is usually easy once you get the combat down.  In Demon's Souls combat is defense first, attack second.  After ~1 hour you should have no trouble with the standard enemies with the exception of the 1 hit kill enemies that occassionally get lucky or because your target lock / camera screws you.  Bosses vary greatly from being a joke to somewhat tough.  Some will go down in 10 seconds or can be sniped with a bow without any chance of being hit.  A few are desent fights that can last 5-15 minutes which require outflanking and counterattacking.  And then there are a few bosses that have a life bar of 1000 and you are inflicting 20 damage per hit to their 1-4 hit kills.  Overall, bosses in this game are a big disappointment.  Instead of the \"rewarding feeling\" that some reviewers are saying you get from finally beating some of the bosses I got the feeling of \"Wow?!  That was it?!?!\"There are a couple of things that makes Demon's Souls \"hard\".  One is the fact that no matter what Armor / Weapon you have or its level of upgrade, it doesn't seem to really improve your chanced of success.  The best armor in the game is slightly better than the starting armor and in reality differs in the fact that it may take 2-3 hits from bosses to kill you instead of 1-2.  The same with weapons.  At the end, you are given a key to get a weapon to take down the \"true\" final boss.  Yet that weapon doesn't do any more damage than most other weapons.  The other it that there really isn't any directions on what to do within the game.  A lot of the time you most likely will have to refer to a wiki-site or the guide to find out what something does or what to do (such as the World/Character Tendencies, what to really do with Demon's Souls, what to do with certain characters to get certain items, etc) because they are not explained in the game.Overall, I gave this game only 2 stars for a couple of reasons.- I found this game to be completely boring and had trouble getting through it due to lack of interest.  If you found Fallout 3 boring you most likely will find this one boring too.- As little of a story as can possibly be in a RPG.  Sad because there really could have been a great story here.- Graphics, character/enemy design, sound are IMO average to below average.  If MGS4 or Uncharted 2 are 10's, this game is a 3 or 4.- Absolutely no direction within the game.- The Art book is a joke.  It is the same size as the game box and is 40 pages with poor/minimal artwork.  All the \"artwork\" and more can be found on any game website.  The soundtrack is a joke too.  Do not waste your money on the deluxe edition.- The network nerfs the game.  This is a good and bad aspect.  Good in that if you are having trouble you can have help from other players.  Bad, well, for the same reason, too much help.  You could actually get through this entire game without fighting a boss.- Too many \"easy\" ways to beat bosses (i.e. - poison cloud / arrows / blue phantoms).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"B.L.","summary":"Lots of New Content","reviewText":"This expansion pack introduces the new continent of Outland.  This continent can only be accessed with a character that is at least level 58.  If you're either just starting to play World of Warcraft, or you have no characters even close to level 58, you may just want to wait to buy the expansion at a later time.However, the expansion also grants you access to two new races, the Draenei (Alliance) and the Blood Elves (Horde).  You won't be able to create characters of either of these races if you don't have the expansion.  So, if you want to play one of them you'll need to get it.  If you're a new player who's just trying out the game, I'd suggest just getting the basic version and playing one of the original races, rather than spending the extra $40 before you even know whether you like the game.You should also be warned that if you're upgrading from the original version of the game, even if your copy is already fully patched, you'll have to install the patches again after installing Burning Crusade.  This is because they printed the CDs with version 2.0 of the client you use to play the game, but they've issued patches after that which you need to log into the server (up to version 2.05 as of this writing).  If you look in the Patches sub-folder of your World of Warcraft folder on your computer, you should already have some of the patches present and be able to simply double click them to install.  If you were to try to log in before doing that, you'll have to redownload the patch before it installs instead, which will naturally take more time.Some people have complained about lag, crashes, and lines to log into the more popular servers.  These are all short term problems.  A lot of people are very excited about the expansion, and so there are far more players than usual logged in at once, which is straining the servers.  Give it a week or two after release and it should begin to settle down.For the basic version of WoW, the level cap is 60.  If you install the expansion, the cap is increased to 70.  If you have a level 60 character and want to continue to advance, you MUST upgrade your account with the expansion pack.Additional level brackets for the Battlegrounds (Player vs Player areas) have been added to accomodate the new higher levels in the game.  Also, a new battleground called Eye of the Storm has been made available for characters of level 61 and above.  Additionally, around the zones of the new Outland continent, there are PvP tasks you can perform such as taking over control of towers, with the faction that controls all of the towers in a zone gaining a small bonus such as a 5% increase to damage anywhere in that zone.They've also added a number of new instances/dungeons.  The new ones have two settings, allowing you to go through them at either 'normal' difficulty, or 'heroic' difficulty.  The heroic setting makes the enemies tougher, and provides increased treasure rewards.  This keeps the instances useful for advancement over a larger span of levels than would normally be the case.Most players will find that, as they do quests in Outland, they quickly begin to get armor that's superior to what they've previously been using.  The monetary rewards in the new areas are also increased.  Additionally, professions have been expanded to cover the additional levels in the game and tailoring has been expanded to include specialties similar to the way blacksmithing and leatherworking work.Flying mounts are available on the continent of Outland for those who purchase them.  However, these are not available to be used in the two original continents.  This is because those areas were designed with the intention that they would only be accessed from the ground and a lot of work would have been required to make all of the quests and visuals work as intended if characters were permitted to fly around freely.Be cautious about buying this item used.  Each copy of the expansion includes a key code that is required to upgrade your account to allow access to the new content.  If you buy a used copy of the software where the seller has already used that key to upgrade his account, you'll still be able to install the software upgrade, but the lack of an unused key will mean that you won't be able to apply the upgrade to your account that's required to actually access the new content.If you install the expansion on a computer where more than one account is used (for example, if you and your spouse each has your own account) then you can only use the key to upgrade one of those accounts.  The other account will continue to work, but it will not be given access to the expansion pack content.  Therefore, you need to obtain one expansion pack for each account you or your household has if you want to access the new content on all of them.Edit:  As of January 22, 2007 Blizzard has announced on their forums that they're working on allowing players who already upgraded using the basic expansion to then also upgrade using the collector's edition in order to get the limited edition pet.  You'll have to call Blizzard's billing service line with the unused collector's edition expansion key, so it's slightly more work than upgrading directly with the CE, but it can now be done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2007"}

Garrelts","summary":"Sleeper Hit of the Year","reviewText":"I'm giving Dead Space my vote for 'Sleeper Hit of the Year'. While other games are getting multi-page print ads and television spots Dead Space will likely fly under many gamers radar in anticipation of hyped titles like Resistance 2, Gears of War 2 or Little Big Planet. Make no mistake though, Dead Space is just as worthy of your time as the more well publicized titles.The plot of Dead Space is vaguely similar to the movie Event Horizon. You are part of a team sent to the Mining Vessel USG Ishimura. The Ishimura is a \"Planet Cracker\" class vessel that travels the cosmos harvesting resources from far off planets and asteroids. Something has gone wrong though and communication was lost with the vessel. You are going in as engineer Issac Clarke, part of a team of personnel sent to investigate exactly what has gone wrong on the Ishimura.Almost immediately things start going wrong. Through a series of events your team will be separated and it's up to you to help get the ships vital systems back online. You'll be in constant communication throughout the game with the rest of your team through the use of a video conferencing system built into your survival suit.From the onset of the game gamers will likely notice the fantastic graphics. In fact the first few minutes of the game while docking with the Ishimura you're treated to some of the best visuals on the PS3. The game features no Heads Up Display (HUD) of any kind incorporating vital data into the players survival suit. Your health bar is displayed prominently on the back of your suit. Switching weapons is a quick directional button press and ammo reserves are displayed right on the weapon. Access to your inventory system is quick and efficient and also features a functional map display that can be used while still playing the game. In fact the entire menu system is built to be minimalistic and keep the player engrossed in the game. Having a health bar and a mini-map seems out of date after playing Dead Space.Another great feature is the inclusion of a directional guide that displays when you press R3. At any point should you become disoriented simply press the guide an you're pointed in the correct direction of travel to your next objective. Given the sheer size and claustrophobic interior of the Ishimura I found myself using the feature often and was glad to have it.The environment in the game is absolutely spot on. The interior of the ship is grimy and dark much like you'd expect in an actual mine. Machinery onboard the Ishimura is braking down and enemies lie in the many shadows. You'll spend a good portion of the game trying to get the ships vital systems like communications and life sustainment under control. Each area features enough deviation to keep the game fresh though nothing ever felt out of place.The sound effects and musical score fit the style of the game perfectly. Enemies will jump out at you around every turn or when your guard is let down. The music will jump right along with your heart, thumping as you run for you life from a pack of grotesque alien life forms. This is a game that is meant to be played alone in the dark. Put the kids to bed, turn down the lights and crank the music.Controls for Dead Space are tight and slightly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. The camera is a 3rd person behind the shoulder camera that is rarely obtrusive or out of place. The only times I found the camera slightly frustrating was when fighting multiple enemies approaching from different angles. It seemed like the camera was a bit slow to move at times, though that may have been because of my panic to escape the enemies at hand.Speaking of enemies, Dead Space features a good variety of alien life forms that want nothing more than to kill whatever is on board the Ishimura. Dead Space, unlike many shooters doesn't reward the player for a perfectly placed head shot. Instead many enemies continue their attacks even after decapitated. Dead Space encourages the player to rip enemies limb from limb as the primary means of stopping your pursuers. To assist you in that end the game provides you with access to a range of weapons that vary from \"Plasma Cutter\" to a flamethrower. Each and every weapon is insanely brutal, rendering vast amounts of gore from your enemies.Another great feature of the game is the ability to upgrade your survival suit and weapons. Using power nodes found in the game game and a specialized machine you'll be able to apply these power nodes upgrading everything about your weapons from magazine size, reload speed, and damage. Your suit will garner you more and more protection and access to an expanded inventory as you upgrade it. There are various other aspects that can be upgraded including the abilities \"Stasis\" and \"Kinesis\". These abilities allow you to slow enemies and machinery down and well as grab and interact with both respectively. Both play a vital role in your survival and will likely be used often.In keeping with the high production value, Dead Space also features full support of Sony's Trophy system. Think of it as an in-game reward for accomplishing tasks of various difficulty.All in all I highly recommend Dead Space to anyone who is a fan of survival horror games. Though the feint of heart and kids under 17 should probably stay away from this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2008"}

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"CJ","summary":"Must buy","reviewText":"This game is so much fun to play.

I was annoyed and ticked and the hacking minigame you have to do a few hundred times was tedious and got on my nerves.  I died repeatedly and was cursing it.  Then...I got to the China level.  It's not that the game improved drastically there, it's that I finally got some upgrades.  After that, smooth sailing.The reason the hacking mechanics are so annoying at first is that it's literally a large measure of pure chance when you're first starting out.  You have to first get up to a skill level to hack level 2 through 5 security systems, but you'll also want to invest in stealth so the random chance of getting caught diminishes and probably fortifying skills so you can protect yourself when the counter attack (the trace) starts up.  You can play the game with minimal hacking skills, but it's more suited to playing with high skills and you'll be rewarded with more bits of the story.  Oh, you can also hack robots and turrets which are sadly fairly limited in number, but are still fun.  I got enhanced strength and at one point carried my &#34;little buddy&#34; around an entire level just plopping him down and letting the turret kill all the enemies.  Yeah it was cheap; yeah it was stupid; it was still highly amusing to be able to.Combat is really well done with a nice cover system that helps the stealth mechanic.  You can also get up close enough to trigger a melee attack that can kill someone outright (don't try it on a boss though) and can be upgraded to kill two at a time, which is danged handy.  You also have access to a nice little Typhoon system which lets you trigger explosives near enemies and if upgraded far enough will even kill robots.Short version, this game is a stealthy one where you can't take too much damage even if you're fully upgraded.  You instead have to rely much on stealth, a hacking mini-game that's based largely on luck, and you have an interesting storyline as you uncover a plot.  The ending you have several choices, though none of them are all that big of a deal.  If you want to see all of them, just save before you make your final choice.  Don't worry, the game tells you when that is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2014"}

Gray","summary":"a rare rpg must have","reviewText":"The first SH game I played was number 3(which was awsome by the way)  Then I read about SH 1 and how it was one of the top 10 rare rp games to own, so of course, I had to have it.  However, I was rather dissappointed when I put the game in and started to play.  The graphics on this game are really bad and the story, for me, was a bit confusing.  Also, there is just so much reading involved and you can't just skip through it.  Sure, you can just not read it, but then you wouldn't know what's going on.  I guess that's why the story was confusing for me, I did just skim through all the talking scenes, which there are A LOT!!Your main character Yuri is kinda cool, I guess.  He transforms into different monsters so long as you have enough MP and SP for it.  The bad thing is he has so many fusions to choose from that it makes it kinda hard to know which three to equip on him.  I just simply had my three favorite equipped to him at all times.Then you have some characters that are simply worthless that I hardly played with at all, like Margarete and Zhuzhen Liu.  Even Alice is pretty much useless until she learns her ability to cure the whole party.Then there are your awsome characters.  Yuri, the hero, of course.  Haley, who is just a kid, but very powerful.  And then there is Keith, the silver bat, who makes a cameo apperance in Sh 3.  And the only way to learn new abilities for your people is to play them and when they reach a certain level, they will aquire a new skill.  That works out great for the team you use the most, but it will take forever getting new skills for your less played characters.This game is very dark and sinnister, very different from SH 2, which was quite humerous, and SH 3 which was set during the Great Depression.  I can't say this game is all that bad, it has some rather interesting features, such as the judgement ring.The judement ring determines the fate of your attack.  If you miss, then your turn ends, but if you're able to hit your mark, your attack is successful.Another thing that's great is that you can aquire like over 200 items to use on the field, or during combat.  Some of these items are quite powerful and should only be used during boss fights.Unlike the other 2 games you don't have crest magic or stellar charts to equip to your characters.  Which can be good so you don't have to keep track of what's equipped to who and leveling up your magic.  However, like in the other 2 games (at least in SH 3) you can have the same magic equipped to 2 or 3 of your people, like Cure or Cure ALL, so you don't have to rely on just one person healing the party and having to keep that person in play the entire game.  Sure you can use your items, but they normally don't affect the party as much as using your magic.If you are interested in any of the SH games, I suggest playing 3 first, simply because it's not connected storywise to the first two.  If you played this one first, chances are you would not play the others.  Don't get me wrong, the game is good, but the others are way better, and hey, why not add a rare game to your collection?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2007"}

I played for the entire time!  Part of this was learning how to set up magic and all the other controls, but once I figured most of the stuff I had fun with it anyway.  What I liked about this was that I think it allowed for both mouse and cursor movement (I think, but I played this awhile ago), which is good because I hate trying to click on a moving object.  I also liked how the game progressed, and even allowed for multiclassing.  The other thing that took so long was that I wanted to get every little treasure, and for the most part I managed it.There was one thing that wasn't correct, though.  A friend and I sat down one time and wrote a character sheet, and it turned out that the druid learned one spell per day (plus perhaps one or two extra for his wisdom), but could use it up to three times per day at the start. NWN seemed to be designed backward in this respect, as it said spells per day was different spells that the druid possessed, but they were only useable one time per day. The sorceror seemed to have normal uses per day, but I believe they were just starting out, and this might account for it being normal rather than backwards as well. As we understood it, spells per day actually meant just that, the spells that were used per day, whereas this spells known meant sepearate spells known. While the spells known might plausibly have given up to 9 different spells, each with 4 uses (spells per day), though I doubt it, I really don't think it was designed to have four different spells, each with up to 9 individual uses. It seemed like it would make more sense to have it as a mana pool, especially since wizards have unlimited arcana, this would mean spells per day was actually 4 uses per day, with any spell, and in a mana pool once 4 spells were cast from that spell level it gets expended. Rather than 4 spells and unlimited uses, which is why I pretty sure it was backward.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2004"}

I've loved the Tomb Raider series ever since TR1, and I have had fun playing each and every one.  The Tomb Raider games really bring action and adventure together to make a great gaming experience.  When I first heard about Tomb Raider Legend, I was a little skeptical about how good it was going to be.  I mean, no offense, but the previous Tomb Raider game, Angel of Darkness, wasn't as good as it was supposed to be.  The story was there (sort of) but the gameplay wasn't up to my Tomb Raider standards.  After seeing some previews and trailers for Legend, however, I knew that this was going to take me back to the Lara I had grown to love.First things first, the story of TR Legend is awesome.  It really kept me into the game and worked so well.  I'm already looking forward to the next game in the series.  Although the game is a bit short (about 7 hours to completion) it is still an amazing game.  The graphics in this game are very good also.  Things like the water effects (especially on an HD tv) look stunning.  They are some of the best water graphics I have seen to date.  Other than the water, the environments and Lara herself look great too!Overall, this game is great.  Although the game is a bit short, there is so much more that can be done.  If you're into xbox live achievements, there are plenty to go after.  Some of them you get just by simply beating the game on either the normal or hard difficulty setting, others you get by finding all of the rewards in each level.  There are bronze, silver, and of course 1 gold reward in each level, even in the Croft Manor.  Beating the time trial for each level completes another achievement.  The achievements are fun to go after and searching through the levels for rewards is also a lot of fun.  I mean, come one, this is a Tomb Raider game an all.  This was such a fun game and is a definite buy (in my opinion) for any xbox 360 owner looking for a great action adventure title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}

A sweeping adventure of betrayal and triumph, the epic legends and deadly creatures of mythic persia burn to life in this suspense filled tale featuring more twists and turns than the labyrinthine palace itself.","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"Unleash the Sands of Time....","reviewText":"I never played the original Prince of Persia. I didn't have a computer back then. But even having not played the original that shouldn't deter anyone who might be considering purchasing this game. Unfortunatley in late 2003, though released to critical acclaim, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time became a &quot;sleeper&quot; hit being outsold by other higher profile games released around the same time. Which is a shame because this is a game that stands on it's own two feet.First thing that stands out is that the Prince in the game is recounting the tale from his perspective. Almost as if he's sitting down with you telling you the story in great detail. This is pretty unusual and at the same time makes the game more engrossing. In the game, the Prince has unleashed the Sands of Time after siezing the Dagger of Time when his father's army invades India. Now he has mistakenly unlocked a cataclysmic power that will destroy him if he can not stop it.The game's stand out feature, aside from it's gameplay, is it's graphics. This is a very nice looking game. The environments are extremely detailed and alot of attention has been paid to the very fine details. The palace is at times huge. With rooms that big sometimes it's a bit difficult to determine which way to go or how to properly reach your goal. But if you step back and think for a moment the solution will become clear. Throughout the palace you'll notice alot of banners that flow when touched. An effect borrowed from another Ubi Soft title, Splinter Cell. You can tell from the outset that this game was very thoughtfully laid out and it definitley shows. The game's camera is at times problematic. It won't stay centered on the Prince at times making fighting more difficult. It can be recentered by pressing R3. There is the occasional slowdown and sometimes the camera will jerk into position.The gameplay is absolutley superb. The Prince is extremely athletic and has a number of stylish and agile moves he can accomplish when taking on enemys. Sometimes it's trickey remember exactly how to make the Price do something in particular but on onscreen tutorial will remind you every so often. The Prince's main weapon is the sword but the most interesting feature in the game is the Dagger of Time. The Dagger will allow you to slow down time, rewind, fast forward and freeze enemies. The XBox game &quot;Blinx: The Time Sweeper&quot; tried to accomplish this feat with limited success. But here it's been refined.The main criticism of this game, other than the camera, is that it's relativley short in length and there's little replay value. Once the story is finished that's about it. You can however play the original Prince of Persia once the game is completed which should be a treat for fans of the original series.If you're looking for something different in the action/adventure genre than this is a game that's well worth your time and money. A sequel is in the works, but till then sit back and let the Prince recount his tale for you. It's a story that's well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2004"}

I played all of the Total War games and I have to say, this game is very disappointing. First, its very buggy, even with all the latest patches applied. When I select my ships, the game crashes to desktop almost all the time.Second, it takes forever to get to your turn (about 30 minutes wait after you ended your turn). I have a pretty decent CPU (AMD Athlon Dual Core 5000+ 2.6 Ghz) and a decent graphic card (Nvidia 9500GT) and 4GB of RAM. There's just way too many nations and the freaking Ottoman Empire (which is the longest wait of all AI controlled nations) has like over 100 boats in the sea and god knows how many land units it has.Third, why the hell do they have STEAM client for? STEAM needs to be loaded first before you can load this game. TOTALLY RETARDED!Forth, not many unique units between nations.

In this game, a thief stole a Protopet from Megacorp, and Ratchet and Clank try to get it back.  But, as you continue farther into the game, you find out who the thief is and just what the Protopet is for....Ratchet and Clank games are fun for several reasons.  One, they are funny.  They have a lot of fun cut scenes, and I look forward to them.  And two, there is a large variety of weapons.  The sheepinator for turning enemies into sheep, a mini rocket, throwing stars.  There are also gadgets like the swingshot, dynamo, and hypnomatic.These two things made the first game very fun, but this one is even better, I think.  In this game, you can also uprgade your weapons by buying weapon mods or using them until they level up.  You will gain extra health when you fight more enemies, too.  You can also buy armor.  This all can result in a strong character and some pretty cool weapons.There is a nice variety of things you can do, also.  There are races, arena battles, flying areas.  There are extra things you can do, too, that aren't required.  There are also skill points.  There's a hint and a location, and if you can figure out what to do, you can get skill points for unlocking fun things such as giving Ratchet a big head or making him look like a snowman.  There are also a few areas with Clank, with new types of little robots he can use, like one that makes bridges and one that can break things.  Also, watch out for the Insomniac Museum...  The game is a decent length, and the difficulty level is pretty good.  It can be pretty tough, but not impossible.  With the right weapons, you can get through the game.So I would highly suggest this game.  It is a lot of fun, very funny, and now you can upgrade more and get a whole new bunch of weapons.

{"product_name":"B000GR9P76","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"Solid, amzing graphics, fun filled, and deeply immersive","reviewText":"I have been playing Lord of the Rings Online (referred to as \"LOTRO\") since June 2nd, 2008 (as of the writing of this article, a month and a half). I purchased a boxed, retail version of the game.SummaryLord of the Rings Online is a solid, graphically lush, immersive and fun experience. The developer Turbine has crafted a game that is not only stupendous to behold on technical merits alone, but faithfully recreates much of J.R.R. Tolkein's fictional realm of Middle Earth.Application Stability and RequirementsStability and availability: In the month and a half that I have been playing LOTRO I have not experienced a single client crash. I have not been disconnected from the game servers. The one patch that has been released did not cause any issues. There was only one scheduled maintenance, and it occurred on a Monday and lasted from 7 AM to 11 AM EST US. In short the game is thoroughly stable and playable.Requirements: I play on a quad core AMD Phenom 9500 system, 4 GB of RAM, running Vista Premium SP1, with a MSI Nvidia 8800 GTS video card. I am able to play the game at full graphical settings with very little loss of frame rate. In fact, performance degradation only occurs within major cities, when there tnds to be 20 - 50 other players in the immediate vicinity.Audio VisualLOTRO has, by far, the best looking graphics and highest quality of sound of any MMORPG on the market (massively multi-player on-line role playing game). The effects from DirectX 10 are amazing. Plants, even down to the tiniest blade of grass, sway and dance in the wind. Every object produces realistic and sharp shadows - they dance about your character, passing convincingly over the contours of your figure, as you move through them. Visual lighting effects are dazzling and colorful.The music and sound effects are top notched. Each area (and even smaller areas within some areas) have their own score. Some are cheerful, some melodic, and others fear inducing. As night closes in a symphony of sounds erupts, depending upon the area it can be a chorus of crickets, solemn songs of night birds, and more.Game PlayTurbine has created the most immersive experience available for the MMO market, in my opinion. The world is beautiful and extremely well realized. You can lose yourself for hours just exploring The Shire, watching the believable hobbits frolic and engage one another in discussion and trade. The architecture and world design, inside and out, is nothing short of spectacular and intricate.Since I can't find the words to accurately convey how immersive the game is, I'll give an example, from my own experience: You may find yourself trotting down the road through the Shire at noon, gazing out for miles up and down the hills, romping through realistic-looking streams and farms as other players and computer-characters alike convincingly act out in the world around you. You stop at an inn where other players have formed a small band, and like a session of Guitar Hero joke as they play familiar songs while on-lookers cheer and make requests (you are able to create and use your own sheet music in the game, or manually play a variety of instruments). Night may begin to fall as you pass over Brandywine Bridge and head into the land of men in Bree. You pass by Buckland and spy the Old Forest - its dark, menacing trees stretching into the sky. And that night sky is alive with moving clouds and twinkling stars. Shortly, the darkness closes around you, and where once you could see for miles, you now struggle to see but fifty yards away in the darkness - until the moon breaks the cloud coverage for a moment, and the eery landscape once again stretches out before you. Finally you see Bree, and the gates that the Hobbits passed through on their way to the Prancing Pony. The city is huge, with a thousand candle-lit windows sending dancing beams of light. This game is amazing in detail.Combat is well realized, mature, intuitive, and fun.Quests are fun and diverse. A story line known as The Books, which can be followed as an optional component to the game, runs parallel to the events of the Lord of the Rings and features cut-scenes and scripted, personal experiences for yourself or your fellowship (party of players). These quests make you an integral part of the story without injecting you into the core story seen in the movies or read in the books. You are able to easily avoid these quests and play solo all the way to level 50 (the current level cap).The crafting system is very deep. Each crafting profession consists of two trade skills focused on gathering and resource refinement, and one trade skill that focuses on crafting. Nothing feels like a chore as far as crafting is concerned. The economy of the game is very strong and is heavily influenced by tangible market factors that the players themselves drive.Player versus player combat in LOTRO is novel, and approached differently - you have the ability to create monster characters and play them in their own, huge, PvP zone, complete with quests for the monster players. High level player characters can enter the zone and attempt to capture objectives and engage in combat. You can create a variety of orc classes, giant spiders, wargs (the wolf-like creatures goblins ride in the movies), and more.Player housing is implemented.The \"end game\" consists of a series of small and medium sized raiding instances.You can easily see that this game has been polished for the better part of a year in the game play department.In short, I cannot recommend this game highly enough. I have zero complaints.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2008"}

O'Niell","summary":"Awesome FPS, A must own for PS3 users.","reviewText":"Wow I am super impressed by this game, very intense.I have loved FPS games since Quake it was my first and still my favorite. I have Killzone the first one, and it was a very generic game, not that great not that bad. Overall it really didn't do much for me. Now KZ2 is I think a great game, I really liked the single player campaign, yes it was short and if you don't die it will take 6 hours give or take depending on the player and difficulty chosen, I played it on normal and had a great time.I really like the controls, I don't see what people are complaining about, I think they just suck at the game. I used an Alt 2 with the SENSITIVITY TURNED ALL THE WAY UP and a hold on the zoom. I couldn't have asked for better button placement. This game is very smooth too. Some older games make my eyes water from extended play for example Killzone 1. Now this was so good, I didn't realize how long I was playing for.As for the multiplayer Wow again, I really love they way it set up, I actually feel as if I am achieving something, working my way up the ladder. Getting new guns the better I do, becoming a medic and healing the wounded ext. The replay value is way up there and I can see people playing this well in to the future especially once they release more maps and content on PSN, more game types would be nice.Graphics as everyone knows are great, but they didn't blow be away, I'm sure KZ3 will be spectacular, and after playing KZ2 I'm in no rush to play KZ3, this is great the way it is right now.And on a side note I think Rico needs to lay off the roids. He was so angry in this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2009"}

It is a game I would gladly purchase again. As far as drawbacks go; the main reasons for the 4 rating (when the game looks and generally plays like a 5) are a cover mechanic that isn't perfect, a controller setup that is sometimes confusing, in-game loads that may only last a second but still take away from the experience, and an aiming system that doesn't feel as accurate as one would hope for. While I'm happy to report that the multiplayer is MUCH more fair and balanced than any Call Of Duty game I've ever played, I still had some issues with disconnects and the gameplay options are not as numbered as they are with, say, Black Ops. In short though, nearly everyone is going to have a blast playing this. It makes Killzone 1 look like child's play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"Let's party!","reviewText":"Mario Party has been incorporating greater things since Mario Party 6 and 7 where the microphone was introduced.  Now that they have the Wii, they have used it in new and creative ways.Story-There really isn't a story to Mario Party, but if I had to give one, I'd say, a circus has rolled into town and Mario along with Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, and more are going to party at it.Graphics-The graphics are really good for the wii.  If you have a small TV, and you are playing multiplayer than it can get difficult to see, but otherwise, everything looks great.Sounds-Happy music, of course, escept on Bowser's board.  I guess some might find it annoying, but I love it.Gameplay-For those who don't know, Mario Party is like a board game where you roll a die (or dice) to move a certain amount of spaces.  Certain things happen depending on the space you land on.  After everyone has had a turn there is a mini game where you use the wiimote to lasso, shake a can, wash something, and more.  Some of the game boards are a little tricky, though.  For instance, in Boo's Castle, you have to find him by going into various rooms, and you have NO PRE-MADE MAP.  It can be hard even if you just play against the machine, if you set them for Hard (or you can unlock Very Hard for a real challenge).Fun-This is a huge party of fun, and it's a great family game, too.  Just one play will get you addicted if you like this sort of thing.Length-There isn't a set length.  I mean the time it takes for you to buy everything there is in the store must be 100+ hours, but there isn't a story, so you don't have a set ending.I LOVE this game, and I recommend it to people who have a little bit ot time to party.  It does take at least 30 minutes to finish one game, but you can always leave and come back.  This is a great game for pretty much anyone, but I guess there are a few people out there who won't like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Some new, mostly old","reviewText":"I tried this out at a friend's house recently. Mario Party 8 basically boils down to the same Mario Party you've been attending since the N64 days, only now we've got some wii-specific motion controls. While these are entertaining, they're nothing so special that can't be found in other wii games. Tilt controller, swing controller, turn controller, etc. And with Wario Ware and Rayman: Raving Rabbids on the block, there's more than one quality party game to choose from now.Unless you absolutely need a Mario Party game -now-, I'd suggest waiting a bit to see if the eventual Mario Party 9 offers more innovations. In the meantime, there's plenty of other wii games to choose from.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun, But Very Different From Other R&C Games","reviewText":"I feel a mighty need to warn you right now that this is not your ordinary \"Ratchet and Clank\" game.  If that's what you were looking for, back away slowly.  If that doesn't deter you, then keep reading.  This game can be fun, but it is much different from other games in the series.  One big difference is this game was meant to be multiplayer (you can still play alone if you want), with the heroes Ratchet, Clank, and Captain Qwark and the villain Dr. Nefarious being the playable characters.To explain how this unlikely team came to be, I must tell you a little bit about the story.  When the game starts out, Nefarious unleashes some creature called a Z'Grute on the city of Luminopolis, but he is unable to control it.  So it's up to him (I'm still not entirely sure why Nefarious didn't just leave and let the thing destroy the city anyway), Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark to stop it.  And then, after they succeed in that, this huge ship shows up.  Then, all four characters end up waking up on some strange planet, which ends up being the location of the rest of the game, as they learn the secrets behind a giant structure known as Ephemeris.Did you catch that?  Instead of exploring multiple planets like usual, you will only explore this one place for the rest of the game.  As I said, this game has many differences from other \"Ratchet and Clank\" games, and this is one of them.  But, there are a variety of locations, so that does somewhat make up for it.  The graphics are good, so these areas look quite nice.  Unfortunately, though, that doesn't make up for the game being very linear and also having a fixed camera.  This camera can be quite a bother at times, and sometimes you can't walk where you want because it just won't move, and it sometimes won't even let you backtrack to get things you barely walked past.When it comes to the gameplay, it is the usual shooting and platforming, with little puzzles here and there.  There is still a nice variety of weapons, including Mr. Zurkon, rocket launchers, bombs, and also weapons for freezing or zapping enemies.  That aspect of the series hasn't disappeared.  There are also some gadgets, including the trusty Swingshot.  And while each playable character is pretty much the same, each one does have one unique weapon only they can use.  Ratchet has the Doppelganger, which sets out decoys that enemies attack.  Clank gets the Zoni Blaster for slowing enemies down.  Qwark gets a shield called the Quantum Deflector.  And Nefarious gets the Cloaker, for turning invisible.New to the game is this vacuum, which I find strange.  It is rather useful, at least, as it lets you move objects, throw things, activate certain switches.  It also lets you suck up little animals, which I also find very odd.  Getting enough animals allows you to get to these places where you help an animal through kind of an obstacle course and get a reward at the end.  But, I still find it to be very out of place.As I said, you can play this game with other people or you can play alone.  Alone, you will have another character with you that helps you out.  This character is usually Clank, unless you are Clank, then it's Qwark.  With the inclusion of multiplayer, a likely addition to the game is the importance of teamwork.  Some of this is done fairly nicely.  You can work together to hit switches and throw things to each other.  Also, if everyone shoots at one target at the same time with the same weapon, more damage is done.  Sometimes, the teamwork is a bit silly.  Often times throughout the game, everyone must press the triangle button somewhere to activate something.  They use this quite a bit, and it is not as well thought out as some other things at all.  I do find a lot of the teamwork fun, though, when the computer character does what they should.  Often they do, sometimes they don't.  It can be very frustrating when the computer character won't cooperate.The biggest things that bother me about this game are issues related to enemies, ammo, and health.  Usually, even if you break open one of the boxes of nanotech (health), it stays until you need it, but not in this game.  If you accidentally break it or an enemy does, the nanotech disappears after a short time, usually before I can use it.  So basically, sometimes you're forced to get through long battles with no health at all.  They also don't like to give you ammo.  Many times I am fighting a ridiculous number of enemies, and I run out of ammo, and they won't give me more, and I can do almost nothing.  I bought every gun in the game, and I go into a battle with full ammo, and I still run out.  And then some enemies take a ridiculously long time to beat.  Especially near the end of the game, they make you fight tons of enemies, and sometimes there comes an enemy so powerful, you empty gun after gun on it, and it just won't die.  It's absurd, and it can get very boring spending so much time on one enemy.  The later parts of the game get very frustrating due to this issue.A few little extra things to mention.  Overall, I find the game to be more childish than the other games.  And while it can be funny sometimes, it's not as funny as the other games, either, and there are some cut scenes that just seem pointless.  Also want to mention that it is odd that sometimes when your character dies, they come right back to life, and sometimes you must start from the last checkpoint.  It's useful to be able to come back because you have hardly any health (four units), but I don't know why I sometimes come back and sometimes don't.  Also, the game seems to have only normal and hard difficulty levels (no easy, not that you'd need it).  I played on normal, and I think it gives a decent amount of challenge, though that's mainly because the absurdly long battles towards the end make up for any parts that may've been easy earlier on.Extras include 42 Hero Bolts per character to collect, I believe.  There are also unlockable skins for each character, a pretty funny video on the making of the game (there may've been more, but I only had one available to me), and concept art for the game.  There's also the usual skill points for completing certain tasks and trophies, of course.Overall, I do think the game could be fun.  I liked many of the weapons, and I liked some of the teamwork when it was done especially well.  If you don't mind it being different, and if you go in with lower expectations, you might like it, as well.  But, like I said, the game certainly has issues, like with the camera and with it being linear, and the game is a lot more childish and less funny than the others.  If you can overlook those things, perhaps give it a try.  I mostly enjoyed it.  If not, then skip it and get a more traditional \"Ratchet and Clank\" game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2012"}

The game is simple.  Move about various military, and civilian targets, eliminate the bad guys, and rescue/escort the good guys.  All the while trying not to double tap one of your team of three, or one of said hostages.  The graphics are very crisp and clean, and gameplay is smooth, effortless, and free of flutters or hiccups.  There are a wide range of guns to choose from.  All of them handle differently, can be used in widely varying situations, and are meticulously rendered.  The degree of difficulty even on Recruit level seems very challenging but the ability to save up to three separate points per level makes it a little easier to clear a level.  The AI varies as well in degrees of intelligence.  Some of the baddies seem rather smart, and sneaky while others run right up to you with plenty of time to cap them, or stand still as you center a perfect head shot.  Fun game filled with trouble around nearly every corner.  A headset can be used to give orders to teammates through vocal command rather then using the D pad which I must say is kinda fun after all the standard \"push this button for this command\" as it is in most games.  I did feel a little strange talking to myself, but its all in fun.  On line play is also supported, and very good time to experiment with which i had the chance to do and all I can say is WOW!!! The varying degree of gameplay that can be found on-line is amazing!! Look for a Riki2000, Gunnerroo, and my best bud JoshuaTree.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Finally, the next chapter is here!","reviewText":"To be honest, I would have loved to have seen another Altair storyline mostly due to the evolution of the game in control and mission variety; however, moving the storyline along in the Assassin's Creed franchise will bring us much closer to finding out what it will take to stop the end of the world. This game gives a very brief intro to the whole Abstergo vs The Assassins story and gives you all the basics of what's been happening in this game world. Picking up where the last game laft off the assassins finds this mysterious wall leading to a new chamber and this is where our story begins.What amazed me the most is that the game is off and running almost literally with a brief stop in 1700s London, a nice ship sequence before our character makes it to the New World.  After getting to learn the ropes and tackling several missions, you get truly floored with bomb of a storyline twist and it really brought a smile to my face meaning the Ubisoft has a few more tricks up its sleeve with this series.Gameplay and controlsStill mostly the same except now you get to shoot guns and you have to learn how to shoot and reload.  Also navigating the forests can be a bit tricky because almost everything looks climbable so it's very tempting otherwise no change from its predecessors.Other distractionsIt seems as if Ubisoft lifted a small page out of Red Dead Redemption's playbook to add some games to keep you busy as you pass the time as you play.  There are several dice games as well as checkers-like game that you can learn to play to earn extra money in the gameGraphicsStill amazing at this late stage in the life of these consoles but some of the same glitches still hang around as far as clipping and disappearing and reappearing objects but so far nothing game-breaking as of yet. However, I do wish that loading times could be eliminated when entering certain buildings.On a whole so far from what I have seen, people who have been nervous about the idea that this wouldn't have the sweeping expanses of Italy and Turkey can put their fears to rest as 1700s America is just as expansive as the other places we have seen and one can even spend lots of time out in the wilderness exploring before going back out on a mission.ConclusionAfter 3 games with Ezio, Ubisoft has finally taken the next step forward in this storyline and from what I have seen so far, it's a good step forward filled with twists and some cool missions.  Those that have been around since the beginning won't be disappointed to see what's next.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}

That would have been OK, but this time around ID has taken a more realistic approach. For most of the game, you'll feel like you're playing Medal Of Honor. There are still fictional elements present, like zombies, mutants, and Nazi cyborgs...but it's kept to a reasonable level. The controls are about the same as most first person shooters as of recently, and the graphics can hold their own with the competition (despite the occasional slow-down during heavy fire-fights). The textures in the walls and ground all look appropriate, and the level designs are well crafted (some areas are based on actual towns in Germany). As with most games ID puts out though, the story falls short toward the end. The first few cut-scenes set the stage for a dramatic story, but the ending boss battle and epilogue feel unclimactic. Another disappointment is the absence of a multiplayer mode...you'll have to the get the X-Box version for that. Overall, Wolfenstein is a pretty decent buy if you like first person shooters. As far as multiplayer modes and customization go though, I have to recommend Timesplitters 2 or Halo instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2003"}

In the year 2014, rising conflict between Mexican loyalists and insurgent forces throws Mexico into full-scale civil war. Under the command of Captain Scott Mitchell, the Ghosts are called upon to face an imminent threat to the United States. The fate of two countries now lies in the hands of the Ghosts as they fend off an attack on U.S. soil. Equipped with the most cutting-edge weaponry and technology, the Ghosts must battle on both sides of the border. New battlegrounds.","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Strong Military Tactical Shooter","reviewText":"Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter was a strong title for next gen consoles.  It was one of my favorite games and still is to this day.  It had a few quirks that were slightly annoying, but overall it was great.  GRAW 2 basically fixed the quirks.  Its gameplay is a little smoother and commanding your squad is much easier.  This makes gunfights a little easier to navigate when you are commanding 3 squadmates, a drone and a stryker APC all at once.  The visuals are fantastic, the voice acting is spot-on, the ambient audio is superb (I prefer to play the game with the music down), and the controls are tight.  The difficulty (on normal) is a perfect balance of challenging but not frustrating.  Now, I will say that this series isn't for everyone.  It's a tactical shooter - emphasis on tactical.  You have to make use of the tools afforded to you (your teammates, drones, etc.), keep behind cover and shoot with descretion.  This is not your typical \"run and gun\" shooter.  That type of strategy will get you killed quickly in this game.  I assume that most of the negative reviews came from gamers that experienced frustration from having to use a little strategy in order to survive.  If you like relatively realistic military tactical shooters, then this game is a must own.This game was totally worth $60.00.  At a price point under $30.00 it's a flat out steal.PROS- Excellent graphics- Great audio- Good voice acting/story line- Tight controls- Fun as hellCONS- Maybe a little short (can be beaten in abour 7-10 hours depending on the difficulty level)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2012"}

I bought this and Homecoming at the same time and is in the process of playing both but i think i will give up on homecoming. The combat system is one im not used to. Not only that but save points are hard to come by. That is where i draw the line. I hate repeating the same things over and over again. Anyways, back to this game. It saves automatically and very often and the combat system is alot better, the scare factor is great and the graphics are better. The last Silent Hill game i have ever played and beat was part 2. That one was ok for its time but Homecoming is just like that one and did not add anything new except for enhanced graphics. From the first five miutes of gameplay, i could already tell Downpour will be one of those games that i play everyday until it is completed. It just has all the right elements and its right up my alley. It does not have alot of fog unlike Homecoming and there is more to explore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I0CO","reviewerName":"David Allen \"Trust999\"","summary":"Pretty Good Game!","reviewText":"My grandson got me into this version of the Batman Arkham series. I had just completed Arkham City, and he brought over his Asylum and wanted to play. There is nothing creepier than an old asylum as a background to a dark game. No blood and guts or anything to speak of, but plenty of creeps. Joker is wheeled in for the 280th time, but escapes and wreaks havoc releasing all of the crazy's and of course all of his fellow criminals including his hot little babe, Harley Quinn. As is typical, the authorities are either taken out, or worthless, so its time to call in The Bat. Assignment, clean up the mess, and get all of the criminals back where they belong, including, Joker who is your main nemesis.Artwork is really well done, lots of dark overcast and grey areas outside, and plenty of creepy dilapidated buildings to explore, clean up, and secure. As with all games, you start with the basics, basic fight moves, and a basic weapon. Batman typically does not have a lot of weapons at his disposal. In this game he is limited to a handful of the most useful tools, such as the Batarang, Double and Tripple Batarang, Bat Claw, Chemical Gun for dispensing explosive Gel, and the Cryptic Decoder. These you get as you play along into the game and reach certain goals. If course, these are needed to get into areas that you otherwise cannot get into without them and their special abilities. There are only a few upgrades, the multiple Batarang you first start with a double blade then advance to a three blade, and the Cryptic Decoder has a longer range capability upgrade. Most other upgrades are Suit related and fight related abilities. Still important, but not as many weapon upgrades as you would or will find in Arkham City.Game play is standard fair for a Batman game. He must work within his weapon and physical capabilities. This is not going to be some 300 weapon, 200 different button combos to learn game. The game is based on using the basic Batman tools, less any vehicles, and his physical abilities. This is a welcome change for me personally. I like and prefer a game with limited button combo's and good game controls. I also prefer to not have to drive, fly and beat a clock. All of those annoying things are not in these Batman Arkham games. Controls are generally very straight forward. There are not as many combo's in this first of the series game as there are in Arkham City. Your pretty much limited to punching, and evading, but they designed the game to utilize the counter attack the most as opposed to fancy combo's. This may take some getting used to if you played Arkham City first, or are used to a lot of insane button pushing configurations. I only had trouble with the control features in one area. The Killer Crock Lair. The sight kept popping into zoom view when Crock would pop up behind me and I had to turn quickly. I tended to push the toggle a little as I move it and this was frustrating as Crock was fast and would kill me before I got things back and turned toward him. This area was poorly designed having a huge maze full of fast acting attacks with NO MAP. It was very difficult to find out which way to go as you had no time at all to stop and catch your bearings. Other than that area, I had no difficulty with any of the other areas in the game, and solving the puzzles and completing the challenges. Boss fights were tough enough for me, not a push over, but beatable if you learned the skills and obtained the upgrades as you played along.The game designers made good use of the games environment. You have three main areas to work in and each one had a few buildings, in addition to two tunnels, and a cave system which included the Bat Cave. You will need to learn how to navigate between these areas, and some of them are not easy to get into without a lot of running around. But during game play there will always be challenges in each area, and they change each time your required to go to or through an area for the next task. So just because you cleared out an area once don't be complacent and think its going to be cleared the next time you enter it. This running back and forth may seem like repetitive and boring stuff, but its not because these areas do keep changing until you get to the end of the game. Then all areas remain clear and you can then go back and search for the collectables for the Riddlers Challenge and of course play the special challenges located iin the options menu.The Riddlers Challenge is a basic challenge of collecting a group or group of objects hidden in the game by the Riddler. In Batman Arkham Asylum there are a lot of different hidden objects. They are Riddlers Trophies, Hidden Messages, Riddles, Patient Interview Tapes, and The Area Maps. Each area will have a hidden map that you can find that will reveal the location of all of the above collectables. Most of these you should have been able to pick up during the original game play. When you have this map for an area, you can look at your game map and these hidden objects will appear as Question Marks at their location. It does not tell you which of the objects they are though so you'll need to learn to know what to look for to give you a clue. Some of these are a little misleading. You can see a Question Mark on your map for example in the Medical Facility. But its in a location where there are multiple levels. You will not know which level the object is on, so you'll have to travel to each level and search. In the medical facility, this is easier said than done as the elevator is destroyed early on and getting up from the sub basement levels can be challenging. Collecting all of the objects for the Riddlers Challenge unlocks some goodies. I collected what I could as I played through, but just before the end, and the last Boss Battle with Joker, I took the time having collected all of the upgraded tools, and abilities, and went back to each area and collected all of the Riddlers Challenge objects.Once you have completed the game and the Riddlers Challenge you can go to the options menu and choose the special challenges there if you like.Over all I was very pleased with this game. I felt the game play was generally very good, and no areas outside of the Killer Crock Lair were considered ridiculously hard. All areas are accessible after you complete most of the game so you can go back and explore and find the hidden objects which was fun. These challenges were set up much better in this game than they were in Arkham City where getting to many of the Riddlers Trophies was more of a pain than it was worth. I found the game was just right as far as length, much more would have been dragging it out a bit, but a little less would leave you feel that you didn't do enough. If you like a good game with decent but not overly hard challenges and the stealth way of taking out enemies, coupled with the seek and find aspect of the game, you will enjoy this game a lot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2014"}

I guess the launch titles were so few for both systems dash to the market that they had to throw a turd like this in the mix just to make sure they would have one corn-fed cash cow. For a PS3 or Xbox 360 game, this is pretty standard issue and would get 3 stars. It's nothing new, exciting, or engrossing, but it's that rebounder you can always go back to if you need someone to cuddle one night and forget the next day.I will say that the game looks great and plays smoothly, but that should be a given for a game with this budget. What I am not seeing is progression.When it comes to shooting games, I like something more like Halo, where I can be stuck with some weapons and feel the need to desperately scramble to get another. In this game, I never feel that urgency. Any rifle, pistol, yawn gun, bore pole, or turd grenade will help me paint the town red (especially in the campaign). And what a boring town to paint. If they weren't going to change their formula for combat, I was hoping that at least the environment would be more fun to walk around in, but I think the levels in Golden Eye were more interactive than these. If a bird is in the sky and I want to shoot it, I should be able to and I should be able to find the body. If there is a piano in a room, I think that such an odd inclusion must serve a function, but when I shoot it or drop a grenade in it, nothing happens. Same deal if I shoot a rocket launcher at a wall or a chair...or a painting. I am looking for those details in a next gen console and if what I am going to get is a recycled shooter like this, then we have to ask what the hell are we doing here, why are people waiting in line for hours to get one of these systems, and how can I get my $500 back (or at least the $60 I paid for this game)? Thank God a next-gen version of this game is not more expensive than the other consoles or I would be hulk smashing Activision's office right about now.I know a lot of people rag on campaigns and would like to see their disappearance, but I always play through the campaigns. So much money goes into them that I might as well. This campaign is out there! I don't want to play it, I want to take some shrooms and watch it! This is the 2001: A Space Odyssey for my generation. What movie could possibly have the viewer go from trying to survive the end of the world (possibly at James Franco's house), to being an Astronaut, and then to being a freaking dog all in the span of 15 minutes? I was really hoping that Tim Allen would be the voice of the dog and we could have some real fun. Seriously though, if a story conceived by the whims of a 5 year old is this games way of showing off, it's going to have a hard time getting a date to the prom, that's for sure.This is one of those games that I would leave out in the cold until you can pick up a copy for $15 or so.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun, But Much of it is the Same","reviewText":"If you've ever played \"Super Smash Bros.\" on the Nintendo consoles, then you pretty much know what this game is.  This is a fighting game where you get to play as characters from various PlayStation games (and I think a little bit of XBox), such as Ratchet, Jak, Sly Cooper, and Nathan Drake, on stages that consist of locations from those games.This game is a lot like \"Super Smash Bros.\".  Characters can move left, right, up, and down (like the old side-scrollers of yore), and attacks are done by pressing Square, Triangle, and Circle in combination with tilting the control stick in different directions.  Your character can do a bunch of things that they could do in the game they're from, and I like that this game has a better variety of attacks than \"SSB\" (which had two buttons for attacking, rather than three).  You can also dodge attacks, throw people, and use items, as well, of course.What essentially makes this game different from \"SSB\" is how you defeat enemies.  Instead of doing damage to them and knocking them off the stage, you must defeat enemies with super moves (which remind me of the Final Smash attacks in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\").  So you attack your opponent until your meter gets high enough, and then you unleash this strong attack on them.  If it hits, it kills them right away.  If it misses, you must fill up your meter and try again.  This can be a bit annoying if you keep missing or if people keep attacking you and stopping you from using it, but it can also be fun and is a nice way to distinguish the gameplay of this game from that of \"SSB\".  I also really like that if you keep going and fill the meter up higher, there are also level 2 and 3 super moves, some of which give you multiple chances to kill enemies.  Once again, this game beats \"SSB\" in terms of the variety of attacks.Another little difference from \"SSB\" that I like is how the stages feature things from two games rather than just one.  Each stage starts off with a main location from a single game, and then about halfway through the fight, the stage changes and incorporates aspects of a second game.  This makes the stages more interesting.In addition to being able to fight other people and AI characters in random battles, this game also has story mode for every character.  There's not really much story to it, though.  It mainly has a little \"cut scene\" at the beginning and end of still pictures of the character(s) doing something, with dialogue.  Then, there are a lot of random battles that don't relate to anything.  Then, you fight Polygon Man at the end.  It's fine, but not super interesting.  There are also combat trials where you must meet a certain goal to complete it, like defeat your opponent with all three of your super moves or use the attacks shown on the screen.  There are some general ones, and each character also has about twenty of these they can do.  It can be a bit fun, but each character pretty much has the same combat trials, so it eventually gets repetitive.One thing I like is that the more you use a character, the higher their rank goes, which unlocks various things, like icons, costumes, minions (basically little versions of characters from games that sometimes will cheer you on in battle), and other such things.A few little extra comments.  The graphics in this game are great, and the music's pretty good.  Unfortunately, I think this game has fewer extras than \"SSB\".  All \"SSB\" games so far besides the first one had hundreds of trophies (I mean actual trophies of characters, items, enemies, and such, not the PlayStation kind of trophies), which made playing the game even more fun.  I hear this game does have two downloadable characters and one stage you can get, though.  Nevertheless, my main complaint about the game is that, while it will take a while to do everything, story mode, combat trials, and the like, it's all really a lot of the same thing.  You can do it and get many hours out of the game, but it will get pretty repetitive.  There isn't enough reward to justify doing all the combat trials and such.  Just PlayStation trophies or a few icons or getting your character to a higher rank.I did have a lot of fun with this game, though, and after years of playing \"Super Smash Bros.\", it was fun to finally play a game with different PlayStation characters.  This game is a lot like \"SSB\", I think, but I do like that there is a better variety of attacks, and I love how the stages mix things from two different games instead of just one.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't have as many extras as \"SSB\" and a lot of things in it are similar.  That's not a reason not to get the game, though.  I still had a lot of fun with this game, and if you like fighting games and PlayStation characters, I think you'll enjoy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

The first part is dedicated to God of War I, while the second part is about God of War II.I need to preface this review by saying I've played several of the other God of War games, before playing this one. In fact, I've played all of them except GOW II. The game started off as an amazing 5 star game! Towards the middle, it took a bit of a nose dive for me, but ended on an extremely strong note (as evidenced by my 5 star rating). This is without question the most difficult game I've ever played. Once I stopped whining and decided to step up to the plate (youtube walkthroughs) I was fine and finished the journey.Combat - I know this is an older title, but DAMN the combat is slick! It may be just me, but it seems like the camera is closer to the action than in some of the later GOW games I've played. Kratos appears huge while fighting onscreen, as opposed to having to squint your eyes just to locate him (this was a problem in Ascension). The combos were very easy to execute, and that's saying a lot because I usually suck in that area. I'm normally not that great at blocking incoming attacks, but for whatever reason, I was able to throughout the game. I know this is considered a hack n slash game, but if you're the button mashing type of gamer, you won't have much luck. You'll have to incorporate dodging and blocking into your combat, or prepare to die a ton :-)Weaponry - Technically, Kratos only has two weapons. You'll start off with the blades of chaos (I finally learned the name of those things after 5 GOW games). Later on, you'll acquire a huge sword (my favorite of the two). I didn't mind having only 2 weapons because some games tend to overwhelm you with options, with some of them going unused. I'm not sure if I count magic attacks as weapons, but you'll have 4 completely different ones to use. Hades' souls, Medusa's stone gaze, Zeus' bolts of lightening, and Poseidon's area attack.Enemies - I was pleasantly surprised by the diverse enemy variety, because I wasn't expecting it. When I think of older action games from the PS2 era, I think of repetitive gameplay that features they same enemies over and over, so I was very surprised. Although some of them are quite difficult to defeat, I always felt like I had a chance. Interestingly enough, there were only 3 boss battles. And, all 3 actually FELT like boss battles and were epic in their own right. The final battle (broken up into 3 parts) pretty much sealed the deal and catapulted God of War into that 5 star territory. I'd say it's easily one of the more epic battles I've been involved in. Hell, it was so intense that I was sweatintg bullets and had to take a shower afterwards!Miscellaneous - Here's where I'll discuss a few of my gripes. Remember me mentioning how the game sucked once I reached the halfway point? Well, that's largely due to the absence of autosave and inconveniently placed save points. There are several puzzles in this game! In my opinion, a save point should have been placed right before each puzzle. If you're the type of gamer that has the bandwidth to sit in front of your tv until you solve a puzzle, then you'll be just fine. However, if you're only able to play an hour here, or 30 minutes there, (like me) you're in some trouble! If you turn the game off before finishing some of those puzzles, you'll be met with a surprise when you start up your next gaming session. You will have to start at the last save point, which may place you at that group of enemies you barely got past the first time (before the puzzle, of course). I believe it took me about 14 hours to complete the game. Please keep in mind this includes me dying a lot, and using more youtube walkthroughs than I'd care to mention.I'd normally deduct a star or two for these types of inefficiencies (see my prototype review). But, I'll give this game a break for two reasons. The first being; it's a PS2 game so what the hell should I expect? The second reason being; this is too special of a game and experience to give it anything less than 5 stars. If you're a fan of action games (and haven't played this) and you're thinking about moving on to the PS4, please give this a whirl. I know it's old, but the updated graphics look great and this is one of those games you'll never forget. Wait, one more thing... I only used walkthtoughs for some of the puzzles and stuff like that. I've NEVER used one to aide me in combat. My Amazon street-cred is important, so I want to make sure there's no confusion.God of War II ReviewSo, in a few days I'll be sun-setting my PS3 for good (in favor of the PS4, of course). I wanted to make sure I went out with a `BANG'. It just so happened that I played all of the God of War games except the second. Would this be a classic case of saving the best for last?Combat - The combat is really the same in all of the God of War games. I can't say I enjoyed this combat any more or less than the previous GOW games I've played. If for some reason, you're new to the GOW series, the combat is mostly melee attacks, with some magic attacks sprinkled in to give you other options. There are 4 magic attacks in all, but I only gave a damn about two of them. I mostly used the earthquake one!!! That's the best and most useful magic attack I've seen in quite some time. I also like the bow and arrow for range attacks. One of the other magic attacks (the Medusa/Euryale head) seems to appear in every damn God of War that I've played, and I've yet to use it... I don't remember what the 4th one was, which means I must have not liked it very much.Weaponry - In my opinion, the best choice of weapons reside in GOW II! The main weapon (the blades of Athena) are in every game, so nothing new there. The secondary weapons are what help make this game shine. Along your journey, you'll acquire a hammer, a spear, and a sword. The hammer is big and slow (as to be expected) but it delivers a massive blow, if you're able to connect. Since the hammer is kind of slow, you may get hit before you're able to deliver your blow. You'll use the sword for a bit in the beginning of the game, and you'll be forced to use it at the end of the game. Personally, I don't like the sword and would be perfectly fine if it never appeared in any future GOW games again... Now, to the main course! The Spear of Destiny was nothing short of amazing! Hell, I could argue that I enjoyed using that more so than I did the Blades of Athena. I could use it for melee attacks, as well as ranged attacks (kinda). One of the spear attacks shot out a small burst, that could be incorporated in some pretty fun combos.Enemies - Just like the weaponry, the enemies are the best I've seen in any GOW game. I was very impressed with the variety, as well as the challenge they put up. I felt like I was seeing new enemies every few save points, and I found that to be refreshing. Overall, the best boss battles can be found in GOW III. However, GOW II has a couple of very epic boss battles. I won't give away anything, but one of the bosses is a personal favorite creature of mine, and I think this may be the only videogame it's ever appeared in. Some of the battles are with giants, while other battles are fought with enemies the same size as Kratos, and that makes for a nice mixture.Miscellaneous - The only negative thing I can think of is probably related to some of the puzzles. A few of the puzzles didn't make much sense at all, and I merely kept trying things until something worked. On the contrary, some of the puzzles were quite clever and well thought out. I'm not sure why, but it took me about 24 hours to complete the game, and that's by far the longest time it's ever taken me to get through a GOW title. Maybe I secretly wanted it to last longer, who knows... When compared to the other games, I didn't die a lot. My only guess is that some of the puzzles (the ones that didn't make much sense) required a lot of my time because I refused to go to YouTube for help. Some Amazon reviewers have stated this is the best GOW game in the series. At the time, I thought they were smoking something. Now that I've completed the game myself, I feel like they're correct in their assessment. The added weapons, better enemy variety, and the mixture of boss types all add up to this being the best GOW game out of the six. I'm very proud to say I closed out my PS3 gaming era with this gem. Knack, you're up next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2014"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

It is learned that the player has been sent in to kill an individual who has been setting up war in the region by supplying weapons.No sooner does the player arrive when he realizes something is not right, as Malaria leaves them wracked and helpless, as their target gloats over them.A quick fight follows which gets the game into motion as you become hired by a local faction to run various missions. At this point, players are introduced to allies and various locales as they run missions for payments. The local currency is diamonds and they more you earn, then the better the weapons at your disposal.In a clever twist, weapons can jam or become defective, so obtaining new weapons is vital. Unlike most 3D shooters, new weapons are not obtained by simply taking them from fallen enemies. Players must instead locate weapons supply areas and purchase or repair new weapons with their diamonds.This new wrinkle drives the game as players have extra incentive not only to complete assigned missions but side missions and explore as well. There are Diamonds throughout the map, and by using your map and GPS, you can locate diamonds scattered throughout the map.Aside from main missions, there are side missions that allow players to earn more diamonds, but add a great chance to explore the map. Ubisoft Montreal has paid great attention to the detail of the landscape and provide players with over 50 square Kilometers of stunningly detailed maps to explore.There are vehicles throughout the game, as driving cars and boats allow for easier travel between locales as well as a quick escape during firefights.The enemy A.I. is where some of the rough spots of the game arise as they rarely do anything unique to avoid your attacks. I often use F.E.A.R. to compare A.I. as enemies that pull tables over to provide cover, shoot over the top of open doorways, and jump out windows to flank you. Many of the Far Cry 2 enemies took a direct path to me, and did not make to many enthusiastic efforts to evade me.Thankfully this situation improved as the game went on, and resulted in some very intense firefights and when you gain allies as the game goes along, you can get some very challenging scenarios. One situation had me pose as bait to draw the enemies out so my ally could dispatch them.The game does have plenty to offer for fans of multiplay as the game offers Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising mode for up to 16 players and I really love the ability to use vehicles in my online matches and take great delight in driving my opponents under my wheels especially when there are snipers in the area.The inclusion of fire is a great feature as with so much tall grass, being able to burn out your enemies with a well placed shot is loads of fun. Be warned as your stray shots can ignite fires that will singe you as well.Another new inclusion is the need for players to consume Malaria medication to stay functional. This causes players to be aware of their supply of the medication and to seek out more medication when their supply runs low.Weapons in multiplay also require players to purchase them, as the better you play, the better your income which allows you to upgrade your arsenal. Players can take part in ranked and unranked matches as well, and being able to track your progress.The graphics in the game are top of the line and the rich detail paid to the landscape is truly a breathtaking moment in gaming. The sound and voice acting is solid if unspectacular but sets up the action and story of the game well.While Far Cry 2 has a few blemishes like the map size, lack of a prone position, respawing bad guys, and some repetitive missions, there is plenty of good stuff here to make this a worthy game for any action fan and one of the more ambitious titles of the year.4 stars out of 5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"B. GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"A worthy sequel.","reviewText":"Half Life is my favorite game of all-time. So when HL2 was coming out, my expectations were high.Thankfully, this game lives up to the hype.The graphics are very good. I have seen many reviews stating that the games graphics look dated. Hogwash I say. There are very few games that compare graphically.The sound, the story, and the physics (though overused a little) are also very good. Plus the game has several hours of playing time for the SP. The only other SP FPS game that had this many hours was the original HL. And the fact that there are alot of friends, enemies, weapons, and completely different locations to visit makes the SP very interesting. And some of the things you have to battle makes this a challenging and fun game.One of the other problems I heard about was Steam. Steam is Valve's program for all of the games. I personally have had very little trouble with it and I like it. No more searching the interent trying to find the new patch or maps for the games. Steam automatically updates all of this for you (except for maps made by other servers).As for the MP, CS:S is fun and they keep giving new maps every couple of months. The only real problem is cheaters. The anti cheat that Valve was supposed to release has not happened yet. But when it does, accounts caught cheating could be banned which i believe is a good thing. There are plenty of maps and servers to play and with the addition of new maps, it stays fairly fresh.HL2DM is ok. There are not as many servers and most of them are very laggy which is strange considering I get excellent latency on CSS. There are also a bunch of maps (including old ones from HL like Gasworks and Crossroads) to play. I enjoy it when the latency is good, but it is pretty tough to find a good server.The fact that the SP is so long and you get 2 MP games here that that alone makes it worth it. PErsonally, I love the game and can't wait until Aftermath (this is supposed to be another Steam update. Is it free? Hope so) comes out. Some people still hold a grudge against Valve because it took so long. But almost every game today has delays. I am just happy it came out. If you liked HL, you will definitely enjoy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2005"}

The quests, reactions, and conversations are all hilarious and yet the game knows when to be serious. A far cry from all of the &#34;serious all the time&#34; games, and a welcome break at that.I do have some issues. There are some glitches (unintentional), but they aren't too common. The side quests are very repetitive after a while, which detracts a bit from the fun, and there isn't a new game plus (not necessary, but would have been nice). I have some other minor gripes, but they are more along the lines of personal taste rather than serious problems.If you want to just have some fun, blow things up, and cause havoc with your gang (and yes, they get super powers too), get this game.

After getting this game for the PSP and quickly went out to buy Silent Hill 2 and 3.This is a great game for the psp and it is phenominal to finally have a real survival horror game on the psp (now they just need to make Fatal Frame or RE). There are tons of weapons in this game from Kitanas, to wood, to whatever you can think of.  In addition to great gameplay the game has a great replay value in the shape of its accolade system.  Once you beat the game once you can unlock all kinds of secret weapons and goodies for use in replays.  Unlike the RE Code Veronica, the camera angles are quite good and the control scheme is great as well.  The camera can hinder you occasionally, but aside from the few times it does, I would say it works very well.  I must commend the makers on the fluid controls, anyone who has played RE Veronica knows that bad cantrols can make a game really crummy.  And worse off, bad controls/cameras are worse enemies than the ones actually in the game, thank god SH Origins does nothing fancy like this!The storyline is absoluetly awesome, and it works well to make the monsters creepy as hell.  The music isnt bad in the game either, although I generally dont pay much attention to the music.  Anyone who is a regular MVC2 games tends block out the music automatically (mvc2 had one bad horrendous track- best fighting game ever though!).My only few minor complaints against this game is that while the camera angles are good, they can be really bad in close quarters boss battles.  For instance when you are batteling Helen in the Sanitarium, the camera angles can get screwy and cause you to misjudge the length of the spikes coming out of her cage. Secondly, I do wish there were a few more save points in the game, for that I am thankful that the PSP allows me to shut it off and turn it back on without losing my progress (its either like a million save points in one place like the theater or too few in the motel or asylum).  Lastly, I did find avoiding monsters to be a little too easy.  If you keep you light off they cant see you at all and you can just walk right up to them and beat the hell out of em.  Definately be careful with carrions, they are a pain and in my opinion the hardest monsters in the game to deal with since they are so fast and deal so much damage.In retrospect after finishing the game for the first time, the game is definately quite short.  You have bassically 4 main sections.  The Hospital, the Insane Asylum, the Theatre and the Motel.  The enemies are not terribly difficult as long as you sneak up on them.  On my first playthrough I got the \"brawler accolade\" in which I killed most of the enemies with my fists instead of with a weapon, including the first 3 bosses (For the memory of Richard you will DEFINATELY need a gun!  I find the extras to the game uber exciting and great for replay value.  During the 2nd play through you can get the motel key to open the secret ending to give you a secret weapon.  I do wish they gave you harder modes to play in, as they did in SH3.Finally, I must say the game is great for casual and hardcore gamers alike.  For casual, play on the subway gamers like myself the game is not too hard (truthfully I was able to beat the hospital, asylum and theatre without using any weapons and without any damage, and this is pretty amazing considering how crappy of a gamer I am).  Once you finish the game, you can make it harder for yourslef by searching for hard to find items, and by getting all of the secret accolades, weapons, endings and costumes.  Also, watch out, while enemies in the levels do not respawn, they do in the main town which is a huge pain.Definately get this game, it is awesome, my favorite for PSP","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Sacrifices gameplay for story","reviewText":"METROID: ZERO MISSION is a remake of one of the most popular games on the NES, METROID.  Before I go into the specifics of why ZM is just a good and not a great game, this is a concise overview of ZM.  It has a lot of great level design, but is much too linear, especially given the fact that it's a remake of METROID, the very epitome of free-form exploration.  The game holds your hand way too much, and your path in gaining items feels almost predetermined.  The game basically tells you where to go next.In many ways ZM feels like a greatest hits package of sorts as far as gameplay goes.  ZM incorporates elements from all the Metroid games, especially the SNES title.  The original had only a limited amount of items; here, the inventory is very much enlarged.  ZM feels like they took all the fun items from the previous intallments and threw them into the remake.  There are several mini-bosses (the original has none), all sorts of powerups, cut scenes, new content (especially after you beat Mother Brain), and radically changed level design reflecting the new items.  The new section, as far as I'm concerned, is quite frustrating and can be quite annoying.  In the end, you feel like you are playing the original METROID through the spectrum of SUPER METROID.In the end, do I think ZM is a good game?  Yes.  But I don't think it's as good as the original because it's much too linear, especially for a series whose hallmark is exploration.  The game itself, while entertaining, does not hold true to the original, which is quite shocking since it is supposed to be an updated version.  Nintendo doesn't give modern gamers enough credit in puzzle solving.  Both METROID and ZELDA threw you into the game without much guidance, and you had to do what you can to discover where to go next.  And that's what made the games so popular.  Now Nintendo would never release a title like Zelda or Metroid without chozo statues that tell you where to go next or little faeries like Navi or the Wind Waker equivalent.  And that's the saddest part about ZM.  They may call it a remake, but all they did was enlarge the story, put in elements from the other titles, and hold your hand the whole way through.  That's not what the original METROID is about.P.S.  The best thing about ZM is after beating it you unlock the original game.(The above is the actual review of the game.  I include this section because it further illuminates the changes made, detailing why ZM is such a different game than its predecessor.).METROID, quite simply, was one of the most popular NES titles, starting a franchisee still alive and kicking today.  Nintendo decided to reinvent the first METROID in a new game called METROID: ZERO MISSION.  Is it a successful remake?  Depends on your point of view.  My belief is they botched this opportunity to remake the original METROID, and I'll explain why.METROID, a first generation NES title, kept the story simple, largely due to technological reasons.  Back in the early days, videogames were largely focused on gameplay, not story.  Mario had to rescue the Princess.  Why?  A big reptilian monster captured her.  The same with Link and Zelda.  Gannon kidnaps Zelda, hides eight pieces of the Triforce, and you have to find them.  The story operates as the necessary impetus to send you on your quest.  METROID is no different.  Not much of a story.  But one hell of a game.The simplistic stories of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS and THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, two vastly important titles, did not really have any real effect on subsequent releases other than establishing archetypes.  Especially with SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, the gameplay takes precedence over paper-thin plots.  As for Zelda, any series continuity becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain with each new release.  In the end, supposedly, each LEGEND OF ZELDA (save for the first two, which has the same principal characters) stars a different Link, a different Zelda, and a different Ganon.  I personally detest the `multiple Link theory.'  There are multiple Links is because it gives Nintendo's writing department (who don't have the best track record going for them) license to come up with any situation to star Link, Ganon, and Zelda without having to tie it into what went before.METROID faces a different problem.  Partly because there hasn't been nearly as many METROID games as the other two Nintendo franchises, METROID has a fairly stable storyline.  Because the original is a first-gen NES game and has a very limited story, the events in the first METROID don't properly reflect why the writing department now wants to take the series.  So what do we get?  METROID: ZERO MISSION.My belief is ZM simply exists to bring the story more inline with the series as it now stands.  ZM ties the events of the first game (now rendered obsolete story-wise) succinctly to METROID PRIME. The best thing about METROID is that it doesn't hold your hand.  It doesn't tell you where to go.  Explore.  That's the hallmark of a Metroid game.  In ZM, they sacrifice the gameplay for the story.  When I play through the original, I generally beat Ridley first.  Now you can't.  You have to beat Kraid, because Ridley has become more important than Kraid in subsequent releases.  The backstory about Samus growing up on Zebes and being with the bird-race was included to bring the series together. I don't have a problem with tying up loose ins, but I do have a problem when you do it at the expense of what made the original so great to begin with.  Much of the explorative challenge has been eliminated.  And just about all of it is for the sake of the story as well as incorporating all the new items.  That is what makes ZM a failure.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2004"}

Unfortunately, issues mar this game from reaching its true potential. First off the game is way too hard for people who are not familiar with this series. Your objectives are not explained well which will leave you confused and wondering where you're supposed to go and what to find. You'll find yourself constantly looking at your map to locate streets and specific locations which will slow you down. Second, is the controls. The combat in this game is extremely clunky and unreliable and I found myself asking; \"Why do I have to press two buttons to attack an enemy? And why is his reponse time slow? Why does my camera change views for me?\" I liked the really creepy vibe in this game but it's so hard to control and solve clues.

Hayes","summary":"Even this late, it is still a blast to play.","reviewText":"So I boarded the Mass Effect train recently when I found that the series was making the jump to the PS3. Because Mass Effect 1 is so low cost these days or that people love gifting it as well, I found myself with a copy and decided to play it, so that I would be able to experience Mass Effect 2 in its full glory.Mass Effect 1 is essentially an amalgamation of a third person shooter with RPG elements, such as leveling up characters and applying their status points to numerous stats.  It was my first time experiencing such gameplay and found it pretty interesting and fast paced.  I relied on the autolevel up mechanics for my character and then other characters that one can have in their parties for speed of play.Characters can also specialize in one of multiple types that affects their gameplay, however if they reach a high enough level then they can become a master of say, multiple weapon types instead of just the one for their class. Players can also specialize in combat, biotics, and tech that all affect gameplay such as being able to bear different armor and use different weapons, to being able to hack and disrupt enemies.  Finally the cast of AI players that join the player on the story can also specialize in these types, so it provides a bit of various fun in choosing the AI characters for an assignment or mission.  Gameplay also afford players with the opportunity to man a vehicle for some missions, and others have some aspect of a time limit imposed on them.The story spans one of trust, betrayal, and seeking to save the day. Through moral actions chosen in dialogue players can go on to perhaps form relationships with their crew, perform good deeds to gain more paragon points allowing them to convince others during cutscenes to do their bidding, or be a total renegade and kill characters. These decisions ultimately leave one wanting to save at every scene and just watch them over again if they did a different choice. Or it makes one want to play the game again and see what changes.  I can say that a decision at the end of the game makes me want to see what will happen if I change.Ultimately the game is fun in what it achieves and is a great RPG for the stars, the game has great graphics to this day, and is fully voiced (even its robust codex with primary information), and with its interesting moral system and wide scale multi galaxy wide storymode, a joy to play. The game can be completed in just 14 hours if one only does the main quest and maybe one or two sidequests though it easily provides double that time if every assignment is explored (and these have voiced acting too).

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Zombies, Burt Reynolds and Airstrikes","reviewText":"Saint's Row: The Third (SRIII)The third incarnation of Saint's Row takes a step in a different direction - toward the town of Steelport. And also leaves behind some old characters and some of the previous franchise. New activities, weapons and vehicles have also been added.Gameplay 6 of 10Despite its seemingly limitless absurdity, SRIII struggles to produce a game that captivates throughout. Missions are very well done, but all other parts of the game prevent the same excitement. In fact it's easy to finish every mission, activity and even challenge in around 30 hours. Now, this isn't to say you can't find anything to do afterwards. There are many vehicles and ridiculous things to fill your time after all the \"real\" game has been played. You can call in airstrikes on unsuspecting civilians, go around tazing people or just fly around in the VTOL blowing stuff up. But, and this is a big but, there's no real desire to. And I think that's what is missing from this game. I still wanted to mess around in Stillwater in SRII. In many ways the games steps back in most places and baby steps forward in others. It went from a grossly over-the-top sandbox game to what seems like a first draft of SRIII that they didn't have time to finish. Possibly the single worst part of the game is that you can't replay missions. What were they thinking!?Missions 9 of 10 (weighted)These are the only reason I wouldn't give this game three stars. The missions are very imaginative, concise and various. You do everything from a gun battle in midair to fighting Zombies because Burt Reynolds (the mayor) said so. I found most of them to be above average, involving the standard clear out a room but a few were so inventive that I had to stop and say Bravo to Volition. It's what keeps the game from essentially being SRII.Graphics/Presentation 5 of 10This game just feels cheap, and in many ways looks no different from SRII. It appears as though they kept all the same gaming engines and control schemes, tossed in a new set of missions and a couple of new types of activities in and called it a day. I realize that you will not be looking very closely at anybody most of the time; but when you do, wow it really resembles a second rate game from a few years back. The cars just look awful. They're unrealistic and quite cheesy in appearance from top to bottom. A little polish goes a long way and they just seemed to be phoning it in.Weapons 7 of 10Some of the weapons in the game were very inventive - the airstrike and the UAV Drone for example really changed it up. Unfortunately the other conventional weapons were uninspiring and actually took me the entire game to upgrade. I believe the standard assault rifle costs around $80-100k to fully upgrade. Here's a short list: assault rifle, .50 caliber pistol, Tazer, Missile Launcher, SMG, airstrike, Giant Dildo (yeah, you read that right), Laser Rifle, Laser Shotgun, Semi-auto shotgun (later upgradable to fully auto). There are many more.Vehicles 6 of 10There aren't really hordes of unbelievable new vehicles. But there were a few to take notice of. The VTOL is a fighter jet / helicopter which has both modes at any one time. The Specter is a jet bike which also acts just like the VTOL but is obviously far more compact. And of course there are the rest from the previous game that everyone loves - tank, armored vehicle, attack helicopter etc. But for the most part I was unimpressed. What bothers me even more is the lack of attention to not just detail but to the obvious things. The physics while interesting, could have used some refinement.Activities 6 of 10They added an activity called \"Guardian Angel\" where you sit in the helicopter and watch over and protect a person doing something like robbing a bank or whatever. Another is called Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax where you go and fight through a series of rooms gaining money for kills and better weapons as you go. It's probably the only activity I looked forward to playing. The rest are the same or just ever so slightly changed. One activity that was changed it called \"Tiger Escort\" where you drive around with a tiger trying to kill you while reporters attempt to photograph it. I guess that there were complaints about the previous \"Escort\" Activity. But you're able to bludgeon someone to death with a four foot long dildo? To me, that seems far worse.Extras 6 of 10Upgrades were another new part of the game in which you can add certain abilities by paying for them with your earned cash. Most of them you're given, but others require many hundreds of thousands of dollars. Vehicle deliver, health increase, dual wield SMGs, tank homie, swap cash for respect are a few of the more interesting ones. And eventually you'll be able to get rid of all but melee damage if you so choose. Oh, but here's the stupid part: you can't shut ANY of this stuff off once it's on. So if you're stuck somewhere because of a glitch, you'll have to reload the game.My biggest gripe possibly in the game is that the cheats are terrible. I mean by the end of the game you're essentially invincible because of the Upgrades and have unlimited ammo and no reload times. What exactly is there to cheat on? More importantly, why at this point in the game would you cheat? There's nothing left to do. And if you're going to allow cheats, make them real cheats. Spawn means that thing spawns where you're standing not that you have to go back to your crib to pick it up. This was standard SRII cheats and for some reason was omitted. I couldn't care less if the Jet doesn't fit in the intersection. That's.where.I.want.it.ConclusionThis is almost certainly the last Saint's Row I'll be buying because I fully intend to sell the copy I have. It's one of those games that peaks right in the middle and then by the end of the game you're left wondering what to do that you haven't already done five times before that point. 30 hours isn't a bad amount of time for a game, but I spent double that on Batman: Arkham City and triple that with Just Cause 2. And I wasn't bored with either one by the end. I played Batman at least four times including all extras. To sum up: the missions are great, the weapons are good, the vehicles and activities are mediocre and the gameplay is somewhat disappointing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"nathaniel furedi","summary":"Great first person shooter, but to short","reviewText":"Great first person shooter, but to shortwas done with the single player game in 4-5 hours.This game does copy off of Wulfenstein, Bioshock, and Dead Space.but with its own twist.I loved the weapons and how you could upgrade them and your items.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2010"}

Someone left a comment telling me this review actually convinced them to GET the game, so read this review before you light your torches. Time to grow up, ladies and gentlemen.*Original Review*Friends, please lower your pitchforks and torches and give me a chance to explain. I am not a Nintendo hater. Quite the contrary, actually. My love for the originalSuper Mario World 2: Yoshi's Islandis immense. Even after all these years, it's astounding how unequivocally perfect that game is in its design, execution, and creativity. In my opinion, it is one of, if not thee, best platformers ever made, and one of my all-time favorite video games. So you can imagine my excitement when Yoshi's NEW Island was announced, with Takashi Tezuka, one of the main directors from the original YI, heading development. YNI seemed poised and ready to deliver the kind of awesome experience thatDKC Returnsdid for the DKC series. In anticipation for this release, I recently did a 100% playthrough of the original YI, and what a satisfying experience that was! It just cemented my love for that game. I am incredibly sad to say that Yoshi's NEW Island, however, is not the second coming of Yoshi glory you may have hoped for, but it's certainly not what I'd describe as a terrible game. I'll warn you right now, this will be a long review as I want to be fair to the game and to you, the reader. Let's get started...First off, this is not a BAD game. There are some pretty big redeeming aspects to it that I think elevate this game to a level of 3-stars despite the major issues weighing it down. Here are the biggest ones...- The classic Yoshi's Island gameplay mechanics. Really, this is the biggest reason I give this game 3-stars. As old as the original YI is at this point, it really does feature timeless, perfect gameplay mechanics. Yoshi's hover jump, ability to devour enemies and convert them to eggs, the ability to hurl said eggs in a huge variety of contexts and situations, the Super Mario cape, and the various Yoshi transformations all return and work as well as ever, for the most part. Even though YNI is lacking in some key areas, it certainly has stayed faithful to the core gameplay, ergo the game is fun to play. Overall, YNI is a sound game from a purely technical standpoint. It should be, seeing as how it is unwavering in its efforts to emulate the classic. It also introduces some new abilities, my favorite being the new SUPER MASSIVE egg that makes me cringe every time I see Yoshi pop it out that can decimate pretty much everything it makes contact with. Some of these new ideas are pretty fun, but the level design rarely utilizes them (more on that later).- The level design. Just like the gameplay mechanics, the level design in YNI is certainly faithful to the spirit of the original. The way the levels are designed around the great gameplay is truly unique for a 2-D platformer, making for really fun, fluid platforming as well as exciting exploration. The characteristic YI collectibles like 20 hidden red coins also add a tremendous amount of fun and addictive replayability to the levels. Thankfully, the game DOES get harder as it progresses too. Early levels are almost insultingly easy, as you'd expect, but later levels do have a fair degree of challenge.- The boss fights. The developers stayed very close to the classic formula of the original with regards to boss fights, and as such, they're super fun (notice a pattern with these positives? lol). There's not much else to say really. Kamek always shows up, turns what would be a harmless little enemy into a colossal beast, and it's super engaging to find a way to dispatch them. My only complaint about boss fights in this game is that they're over way too quickly.- Good ol' Yoshi charm. I don't know what it is about Yoshi as a character and as a series, but it seems any game starring Yoshi has a very distinct brand of quirky charm you can't find anywhere else. It doesn't matter if it's a mediocre game, or a masterpiece, every Yoshi game has it, and this game does too. I wish I could explain it further, but that's as well as I can say it. Intangible Yoshi charm? Check.And there you have it. Like I said, Yoshi's New Island isn't necessarily a BAD game. It does have some big strengths. However, there are a few aspects with mixed execution, as well as a couple HUGE problems that immediately jumped out at me and stayed like a thorn in my side. Sadly, they also do an effective job of dulling and obscuring the game's strengths. Here are the biggest problems:- The story. I almost didn't even mention this. After all, the plot in any platformer is not that important. It's only meant to introduce the gameplay, and it does that here. What I DON'T like is how the game stomps all over and ruins the heartwarming ending of the original YI. Turns out, the stork delivered Mario and Luigi to the WRONG PARENTS at the end of YI. Who knew? Kamek shows up, babynapping shenanigans ensue, and the Yoshi clan band together once again to reunite Lil' Luigi with Baby Mario and stop Bowser from turning their home into his vacation spot........ No Nintendo... Just, no... I hate how they ruined YI's ending, immensely.- The visuals. I love the coloring book aesthetic of the original YI. Not only is it a visual treat, but the bright colors and thick black outlines for all major features/characters actually made the gameplay better, as the expressive, stylized art style made it easy to focus on what was happening. YNI's visuals look more likeYoshi's Storymixed with an oil painting to me. It's an awesome idea on paper, but having it on the portable 3DS' screens makes everything feel more smeared and muddled. It can even be painful on the eyes trying to make out what's happening at times. A nice 3-D effect alleviates some of that, but not all the way. They also tried experimenting and added in visual elements that feel completely out of place, such as having the normal, colorful foreground clashing with a minimalistic, black and white Sumi-e painting for the background. It's just distracting. The animations are also not as good as the original, which is odd. Lastly, Yoshi's clown shoes just look stupid, I'm sorry. I realize this aspect is subjective. I'm sure others will love how this game looks, and indeed, sometimes it IS gorgeous. However, I think most will agree that, much like the rest of the game, it's a mixed bag.- The sound design. Music in games is important to me. A bad soundtrack can really bring a game down and oh my god, the soundtrack in this game is atrocious! I can't possibly express how awful most of it it is. At least 85% of the tracks are just remixes of the first level's song. Seriously, what the heck happened here?! The original YI had tracks so memorable that I have never forgotten them, even after all these years (The Flower Garden, Underground, Athletic, Above Ground, every Boss them including the *epic* Final Boss theme, etc). The original YI had music that was uplifting, exciting, and so catchy, with wonderful instrumentation (especially for the SNES). Yoshi's NEW Island, on the other hand, has music that is boring, forgettable, and even downright annoying. Most of it is super slow, dull, and about as catchy as a slimy, dead fish. It's like a bunch of lullaby rejects. Even worse, most of them sound like cheap midi files emulating toddler toy instruments. Seriously, this is embarrassing (\"Cruise the clouds\" gave me cancer). It's no stretch to say the music of this game actually takes away some of the joy in the gameplay. How unfortunate. Other sound aspects, like Yoshi's frequent voice clips, as well as Baby Mario's classic crying, are sure to infuriate some, while others, myself included, will be indifferent to it. Still, that music man... my childhood weeps.- Game length. This game is short. Six worlds fly by in less than five or six hours at best. Granted, you can keep playing for the sake of finding all collectibles, and because the level design and mechanics are mostly fun, this game does have some replayability in it. Still, I find the amount of content a bit disappointing.- The new gameplay mechanics. The core classic YI gameplay mechanics are really wonderful, but some new ideas do not fare too well. I hate how some level designs and vehicle mechanics incorporate the 3DS gyroscopic controls. It doesn't work well and feels like an out-of-place gimmick. Other new ideas, like the giant Yoshi egg and egg-doser I mentioned earlier, are cool on their own, but the level design simply does not take advantage of these abilities, so you often won't use them. Despite the \"NEW\" in the title, YNI feels like the main focus was on delivering old YI gameplay. That's ironic.I could go on, but the point is that Yoshi's New Island is a mixed bag. I rarely rate anything 3-stars on here, but Amazon's definition of 3-stars is \"It's OK\" and that's what this game is. It's nowhere near the quality of its legendary predecessor. In some ways it's better thanYoshi's Island DS, but in others it seems worse. Considering YNI was made by the same people as YIDS, I'm not sure what to make of that. For fans of the original YI, this game will feel like a glorified, expensive expansion pack with the same great gameplay overall but with some clumsy design and presentation issues. For those totally unacquainted with YI, you'll be presented with a Nintendo platformer about as equal in quality asNew Super Mario Bros. 2, which is perfectly decent, but not nearly as good as the games it's trying to emulate. For me personally, this was kind of disappointing. Yoshi's Epic Yarn is now my last hope for a great Yoshi game in a while. Rather than keep playing YNI, I'll continue playingDonkey Kong Country Tropical FreezeandPersona 4 Goldenfor now. I wish I could give a solid recommendation one way or the other, but considering Yoshi's New Island is such a mixed bag, I really can't. I hope this review was helpful, at any rate. Thanks for reading. You can go ahead and get out your torches now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2014"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Five stars, but...","reviewText":"Every game has flaws, and BSInf has more than BS1 and BS2, but its strengths outweigh its flaws, so I still give it 5 stars. I don't recall BS1 or 2 having any glitches in it or causing lock-ups, and BSInf has both, but not so many as to ruin the game.On the other hand, BS1 & 2 both were pretty hard on the first playthrough but way too easy on subsequent plays after learning how the game goes. That hasn't kept me from replaying each at least a dozen times, but I rarely play them all the way through because they are not as much fun once you get to be too powerful and stay maxed out on health, money and supplies which makes looting pointless. I'm halfway through my 2nd playthrough of BSInf and the combat still seems more challenging than on BS1&2's first playthroughs even though supplies are usually still very plentiful. I haven't tried the 1999 mode, but I suspect it will keep the difficulty up even after many playthroughs.One thing missing in BSInf are the hacking mini-games. Instead, when faced with a lock, You have to ask Elizabeth to pick it while you stand around watching. Instead of hacking turrets, you have to hit them with a Vigor, or just ask Elizabeth to pull them through a \"tear\" for you which uses none of your resources. Supply machines don't have to be hacked either.The worst change in BSInf is that you can no longer save whenever you wish. Very rarely is an autosave going to come along exactly when you are ready to stop playing, or you have to stop at an autosave when you could have played a little longer or risk having either to turn off the game and lose your progress or to leave it on and waste electricity.I have never liked having to have \"companions\" in shooters. They tend to get in your way when not needed and not help when needed. BSInf does an excellent job with Elizabeth who rarely gets in the way (though once I had to restart when she blocked me in a corner and would never move) and provides health, \"salts\" and ammo when needed.BSInf is designed to make sure that you explore every inch of the environment not just for achievements, but to find critical elements such as lockpicks (to give Elizabeth) and gear. Also, while gear may be in the same place on replays, which gear will be there is randomized. I've gotten some great gear on the 2nd playthrough that I never saw at all on the first.Although the ideas behind most of the Vigors are the same as in BS1&2, the treatment of them is different enough that you never feel like you are playing a rehash of the earlier games. Some reviewers complained that BS2 was too much like BS1; well, I don't think that can be said of BSInf.A great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2013"}

But I have played many RTS games including the Age of Empires 1, 2, 3, Empire Earth, Empires: Dawn of Modern Warfare, Rise of Nations, Home World 2, Orb, American Conquest/Fight Back, etc.... the list goes on and on but here's my point!I have never played a RTS game with such depth and top-notch graphics to boot that captures your imagination and takes all of reality and time like this game does to me!!! The main reason is there is soooooo much you can do with this game. You can fight every battle you want (battle map) or have the Computer resolve it for you. You can in-slave the population after you successfuly take a settlement or put them to the knife. You can micro-mange to a depth I have never witness before!!!

It's endless and it has more diplomacy and stradegy than any game I have seen to date (2004) including all those RTS games I mentioned. I should of played Shogun/MTW and I didn't but I don't regret it. Besides, this is more up-to-date than Shogun/MTW?In all, I think you guys are right (most of you guys) about this game. It's awesome!

It had the style, it had the games to match its impressive technology, and it had the market base of loyal fans all round the world who swear by it. But it had limited processing power and the use of memory sticks to store save games would always become redundant. Yet PS2 was the console to beat. Beat?...are you joking? Which one?.Arrive...the XBOX!.With a beautiful yet sturdy exterior design, not to mention the 733Mhz processor with an insane 233Mhz GPU, the XBOX has a built in HDD and Ethernet Port for XBOX Live. Add to that, the console supports 5.1 Dolby Digital and hosts 4 ports for its superbly ergonomic controllers. And this is just the icing. The XBOX can run movies with a DVD kit that can sum up to being a theatre on its own if you have the right TV and Surround sound system. The effect is extremely rich and immersive.The XBOX is seriously ahead of other console in terms of power.  It cranks out so many frames, you'd wonder if a maxed-up high end computer can stand up to it. You'd wonder if any PC, let alone another console, can render Ninja Gaiden like the XBOX. I haven't seen it so far. So rich and seamless. One other great aspect of the console is that its driver (OS) is nothing but a striped down version of the Windows 2000 kernel. It seems to add tremendous flexibility is game design, earning it accolades. The results are there to see. Games like Ninja Gaiden and Halo, that can make a PS2 cry in agonizing pain to render, is a breeze for the XBOX. And every game on PS2, GBA, if ported to the XBOX, would look so much better. But even I will agree with you, what use is a good looking game without good gameplay?. Good question. But only one answer is \" That is the job of the developer...not the console......\"And herein, the XBOX scores again.......Adding to its superior technology, the console has some fantastic titles to showcase its graphical prowess. From Halo, Rallisport Challenge 2 to Burnout 3, Splinter Cell etc, the list is pure quality and not just quantity.Agreed, the console market has got hot and other console manufacturers wont take on the XBOX lying down. Already rumours are spreading that PS3 is launching with some impressive technical and commercial values. But as of now, if you are in the 20-30 age group or higher who likes to play mature games, then XBOX is the one, for you wont find a more complete machine around to run them at photo-realistic levels. Not only that, but you will be treated with the release of pure quality games like Halo 2, Otogi 2 , Call of Duty :Finest Hour etc, this holiday season.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"More of the Same","reviewText":"Let me start the review by saying that while I've played every Call of Duty game, I've never been a huge fan of the multiplayer. I am one of the few people that play COD for the single player campaign. Like the previous Modern Warfare games, the set pieces are epic in this game, however in general it doesn't surpass what has already been done. Also, in some ways it's a step back from Black Ops. One great thing about COD Black Ops was that it had an amazingly well crafted pacing, with multiple different modes providing differing levels of action and excitement. In MoW3, it's constantly balls to the wall action, with very few other modes, the two that only come to mind are the practically broken controls of the the underwater section at the beginning of the game, and one of COD's classic zoomed out aircraft massacring. There was one thing I noticed in this game that I hadn't in previous versions, and that's the very limited enemy death animations. Multiple times, I noticed myself shoot the enemy, starting a death animation, than while he was still standing/dying I kept shooting and unloaded a whole clip into the enemy. Even though I kept shooting, the animation wouldn't change at all, it was locked in, and whenever I noticed this it took me right out of the game. Other than that, the same problems present in previous iterations are still there, specifically endlessly spawning enemies if there is some sort of objective you have to complete, and only being able to crouch or lay behind walls just so the game isn't compared to Gears of War, among other smaller problems. I also found myself multiple times getting caught up on pieces of the environment and the other characters. Similar to this, I found it annoying that all of your AI partners could do cool things that you can't, specifically more agile precise movements and being able to lock onto walls and shooting from cover. The story presentation is again very basic and heartless, I didn't care about any of the characters, and most of the time I didn't even know who I was. Even with all those problems though, I had a lot of fun with the main campaign, I just wish it was a few hours longer.As far as the multiplayer, not being a fan, there was nothing present in MoW3 to change my mind. It's especially frustrating starting as a newb when all of the other players have awesome gear and perks along with hours & hours of experience. It just isn't very fun constantly being killed, and there isn't any help if you're having trouble. It would be nice if there were more helps with death streaks, instead of just being able to sprint faster for a few seconds. It's also frustrating when you're being killed constantly by airstrikes, which just seems unfair.So overall, this is just another yearly Call of Duty expansion pack. While it is very fun at times, the success the game sees really prevents any serious innovation from the developers. I mean why would they want to fix something that isn't broken? I just hope that Activision tries to do something different before the game goes the way of Guitar Hero and Tony Hawk, because I can't see every gamer continuing to buy the same game every year with a new skin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0037LVW9M","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"What Socom 4 should've been","reviewText":"Well, Ghost Recon is finally here. After all of the videos, hype, and especially the many release delays, could this game be worth it?CAMPAIGN/STORY: The campaign is a 14 mission and 12 plus hour experience across the globe in order to track down the person responsible for smuggling a warhead.GAMEPLAY: The game play is just outstanding. I have never played a military shooter that makes me feel like such a bad***. The game is based on being tactical, which means patiently sneaking around maps, eliminating enemies, and capturing the objective, without alerting an enemy, just like the Navy Seals do. With that being said, I feel like I am playing a gaming version ofAct of Valor. With that being said, it is not a SEAL game, but it definitely has the essence of what one SHOULD be.The game play is very fast and every movement is VERY responsive. When running to get cover, the camera shakes, reminiscent of the football game, Backbreaker Football. The shootouts are very realistic and intense, especially in the urban maps. There is just back and forth shooting. Meanwhile, civilians are caught up in the midst of it. Engage enemies carefully, when surrounded by civilians! Kill too many and the mission is over.Cover can be manipulated by gunfire. Therefore, if an enemy is behind weak objects, such as wood, it can be shot through. This goes both ways for the player. Sometimes, cover cannot be relied on, too heavily because it CAN be manipulated by gunfire. Sometimes, the player can be \"suppressed\" by heavy gunfire. The player is virtually stuck behind this cover, until the heavy gunfire ceases. Meanwhile, camera shakes and the sixaxis controller vibrates vigorously.The hit detection is also outstanding. No unloading a full clip to kill enemies. A few shots and \"tango eliminated!\" Hand to hand tactics can be used, as well. They are random action via snapping an enemy's neck, butting him with the weapon and \"finishing\" him off with a brutal stomp. I like using the stealth kills, such as snapping enemies' necks or shooting them in the back of the head from point-blank range.Keep in mind, stealth doesn't ALWAYS apply during parts of certain missions. Sometimes, a mistake can be made by the player and alert enemies, which leads to massive firefights. In addition, when an objective is obtained, many enemies may arrive, which means also means a massive firefight. Reverting back to stealth, some parts of missions does NOT allow alerting enemies. In other words, if an alert is raised, mission over.EQUIPMENT/GADGETS: A Ghost Recon game would not be a game, without gadgets. First, there is the infamous optical camouflage. The optical camouflage is the most important piece of equipment, which the Ghost have. This is what keeps the Ghost concealed, throughout the maps. Nothing has to be manually done to activate it. Just go in prone, crouch or find cover. Then, it activates. The only time the optical camouflage deactivates is when spotted or when firing. The optical camouflage cannot be seen from a distance, but if in the sight of an enemy, a warning signal will come up, which indicates suspicion upon the enemy.The UAV is easy to use. Just send it through the air, and it spots each enemy throughout the map. Not to mention, it tells, which kind of weapon they have. Then, there is the sensor grenade. When thrown, it is able to detect nearby enemies on land AND through walls. Then, there is the magnetic X-ray. This device allows the player to detect enemies through solid surfaces, and detect metal objects, such as weapons. I once saw the engine on the inside of a truck. There are OTHER surprise gadgets to use on the game, but that is a secret......GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Contrary to what some opinions, the graphics are very good in their own kind of way, meaning not to expect vivid colored graphics of games, such as Max Payne 3, Uncharted or MW2. The Ghosts, weapons, enemies, and maps are very detailed and sharp. However, the player models, without the mask on some cut scenes look dated. However, keep in mind that this is 3D game! Therefore, the graphics SHOULD be enhanced with a 3D HDTV and glasses.GUERRILLA MODE: This new mode allows up to four players to face 50 waves of enemies. Of course, the more successful a player is, the increase of difficulty in the enemies.MULTIPLAYER: Multiplayer plays similar to single player, meaning it maintains its 3rd person game play. Cover is a necessity and so is teamwork. The modes in the game are more mission-based.SOUND/VOICE: This game has Dolby Surround Sound. However, it is not quite as crisp asBattlefield 3 - Limited Edition. Still, hearing the weapons being fired is a realistic experience. Each weapon has its own distinct sound. Even the sound of the weapons being reloaded is authentic. The clarity in the Ghosts' voices during game play is just intense. The voices sound very gritty, especially when they inform each other on what is going on around them.TEAM A.I.: Very smart and tactical. The player is in good hands with this group. They alert the player of the surroundings on the map. For example, if an enemy is spotted, they will tell the EXACT location and what type of weapon he has. Not to mention, they ONLY fire, when fired upon or given instructions to. With that being said, the team cannot manually be commanded to do anything, other than shoot. They mostly move about on their own. As a fan of the Rainbow Six series, that is sort of disappointing to me. However, I believe they do this on Future Soldier because it was very EXHAUSTING to command a squad and use all kinds of gadgets in the previous Ghost Recon titles.The Sync Shot is outstanding. This is a feature that the developers ofSOCOM 4: U.S. Navy Sealsfailed miserably to accomplish. The max of four targets can be marked via ground or UAV. In order to take down all four targets, one shot MUST be made by the player. There is nothing like commanding your team to mark targets, and simultaneously downing enemies with single shot in slo-mo, when this is done. On the contrary, mark less than four targets, and the team can be commanded to take out all three, simultaneously.WEAPONS: A player can choose over 20 million weapon combinations in the all new Gunsmith mode. This mode enables a player disassemble and modify a weapon down to the barrel, gas system, magazine, muzzle, optics, paint, side rail, stock, trigger group, and the under barrel. In addition, the customized weapon combination can be tested out at the range.VERDICT: If you are into tactical shooters, look no further than Ghost Recon Future Solder. The game has everything a player can want in a shooter, such as tactics, stealth, firefights, stereo sound, customizable weapons, gadgets, fast game play, and good graphics. The UbiSoft team took a lot of time to make this game, but it paid off and made this game definitely worth the wait. This is why I give this game five out of five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","summary":"Top Level But It Is NOT A PC!","reviewText":"The Slim PS3 is most certainly the best model to get, backward compatibility notwithstanding. It has solved the heat issues and the laser/etc no longer wears out. The one thing to keep in mind is that it's not a PC.Ok, in terms of basic functionality, it can do a lot of the things a PC can do. You can stream media off a computer through your system, surf the web (albeit with an outdated browser), play games, watch Netflix etc. Ok, you cannot use your PS2 games and that stinks but we'll get over it eventually. The improvements of the slim model outweigh that negative aspect. What was changed? The CPU/GPU is now smaller, uses less power and generates less heat as a result. While my old, fat retail bought PS3 was encountering a host of odd problems at age 2, my PS3 slim, which was bought at a pawn shop, is fine, now nearly at age 3.It has fewer USB ports, but you can just use a multi-USB box if necessary. The online play is free and as a result, the PSN XMB is nowhere near as good as that of Xbox live but we'll deal. The price and built in extra features blow the 360 away. Think of it this way, in addition to Blu-Ray, you get standard wireless controllers. That's considered a big bonus on the Xbox. I think Sony is definitely an evil empire to be sure, but this is a worthy investment for a system if there ever was one.Again, it's not a PC. It won't emulate everything ever created under the sun. That's what a PC is for guys...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

I wonder if the death of the PS3 Network is partly to blame for all the frustration and low reviews. Listening to people complain about the length of the single player campaign is absurd given the number of games that now focus on multiplayer. This is a multiplayer game after all. The RPG elements are well thought out, and the game actually has well planned classes that encourage team play. There are no single shot kills ala MW2, nor are you going to see the same gun, same class, same perks, same everything over and over because only one load out is worth taking. That isn't what brink is meant to be. Also, the different body types and weapon load outs work quite well. As you develop your character the game really opens up. I am enjoying the game, and only wished that I could have jumped online sooner rather than later. I am hoping that they add downloadable content at some point, as additional levels would be great. Also, this game is taking some risks, something many games aren't doing anymore. I like the movement system. It works quite well. The levels are really clever and reward different styles of play. Choke points are only that way if you can't figure out (which is easy) how to outflank the other team. There are multiple ways to navigate the maps, and depending on body type (i.e. light players can get more places) additional pathways open up. But, this is at the expense of health and weapon options. Once again, there are choices to be made. It's a fun title, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid team based shooter with a twist.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0006SST9U","description":"Gaming&#146;s notoriously naughty squirrel--Conker--arrives on the Xbox with a bang in an all-new Xbox Live-enabled team-based shooter,Conker: Live and Reloaded.The game features intense Deathmatch and Campaign story-line modes via Xbox Live and System Link, and players can compete as one of six combat specialists across multi-mission campaigns covering Old War and Future War. The warfare promises to deliver the non-stop action, humor, and innuendos Conker is famous for.Also included is the critically acclaimed single-player game,Conker&#146;s Bad Fur Day,completely recreated for the Xbox with stunning graphics and unparalleled attitude.Features:Team-focused, story-driven, Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay is at the heart of this shooter, pitting the noble Squirrels against the evil Tediz. Players can choose from a variety of scenario-based missions featuring two unique campaigns--Old War and Future War--with each mission featuring its own distinctly challenging gameplay mode. Campaign story lines, comprised of multiple missions played progressively, bring an innovative and fresh approach to team-based shooters and Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players.Elite squad action: Players choose from six character classes, including Skyjockey, Long Ranger, Grunt, Demolisher, Thermophile, and Sneaker, each with its own signature weapons and abilities. InConker: Live and Reloaded,team composition has strategic and tactical advantages and implications.Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay, innovative campaign story lines, and distinctive humor all make for a great experience on Xbox Live. Online players strategize, cooperate, and communicate as a team in Campaign mode, or venture out solo against buddies in Deathmatch. Players can earn war medals, rise through the ranks, secure unlockables, and download new maps.Massive arsenal for maximum carnage: Devastating weapons include camera-guided rockets, an acid thrower, and loads of grenade types. Operate five types of vehicles including Sky Steed, Mule Bomber, R-Hog, Toad, and Tankus, and various types of equipment such as anti-infantry sentries, medi-guns, and a snoop camera. Special abilities allow players to disguise themselves or feign death and sneak up on unsuspecting foes to unload a demoralizing array of attacks.Twisted and irreverent world of Conker: Over-the-top humor, characters, and gameplay dominate in every way with rude wit, lewd innuendoes, and ridiculous violence. The juxtaposition of the characters, Squirrels and Tediz, and their world is at the heart of the humor. The expressions, exclamations, and special effects bring out the true Conker flavor.Wildly bizarre single-player adventure: The critically acclaimed single-player gameConker&#146;s Bad Fur Dayis now on Xbox, fully recreated with amazing graphics and enhanced profanity. The game is full of hilarious situations, movie pastiches, off-the-wall puzzles, and crazy characters in an offbeat world, including horny bees, voluptuous sun flowers, singing piles of poo, and even Death himself.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Conker: Live and Cut","reviewText":"Give Nintendo credit, they may not be number 1 in sales, but they do start trends that everyone and their dog copies, whether it's analogue controls, or complete, and groundbreaking remakes of yester-generation's groundbreaking titles.While the not-so-big-N was spending time getting remakes of Resident Evil, and the absolutely incredible Metal Gear Solid Microsoft decided to utilize their purchase of former Nintendo 2nd party Rare to make a remake of a ground breaking and revolutionary entry to the N64 era.Conker's Bad Fur day was not a hit. It came out too late in the N64's lifecycle for it to be, most people were already looking toward the next generation. Those that were interested in the game tended to ask for \"The squirrel game on the Playstation\"; ever ignorant to the fact that Nintendo DOES target adults from time to time. Microsoft's theory was that Conker failed because it was on a Nintendo system.It's little irony that this incarnation of the game isn't faring much better, but there's a substantially more explainable reason this time... Rare made some changes that just don't really work, or improve the game.Graphically the game is a mixed bag. Though the polygon models, fur rendering and overall detail has been significantly improved over the original (It's beautiful) the game still has the usually 30 frames per second frame rate and somewhat choppy animation of the original. While this was fine during the N64 era, it's disappointing now that they didn't improve the animation at all. Overall, however, this is a vibrant and beautiful game, and one of the best looking games over all this generation. Rare definitely deserves some kudos for the amazing amount of detail this game contains.Game play wise the avoid combat or solve puzzles to kill enemy tactic of the original (Minus the Spooky and saving Private Rodent sequence) was replaced with a choppy dual analogue with baseball bat combat engine that just didn't really work all that well. The combat was sloppy, repetitive and boring, even frustrating at points as the dual analogue system does not make for easy retreats, and I found myself impaled by the imps more often than not, or falling off of high places trying to get away after attacking because of the sluggish, and sloppy combat system. In the end, Rare should have left well enough alone. The Dual analogue control of the Saving Private Rodent scene was overly complex and made for a more frustrating experience than what the original offered, however, it did help the Spooky sequence, making it possible to aim much easier than I remember it being in the original. I'm not sure how or why it worked out that way for me, but it's did. Spooky benefited from the new combat engine, the rest of the game was made more frustrating.Content wise the Xbox version suffers from severe censorship. I mean severe. Nintendo let Rare get a way with a lot more than Microsoft did, ironic, considering the market perceptions of the two. The sunflower now wears clothing, language is almost all bleeped out, and oddly, instead of the Tediz bleeding stuffing like in the original, they just bleed. The Electric Eel minigames is gone, as is the manned turret in Saving Private Rodent, but the most frustrating elements of the original (The race with the cavemen, in all it's cheap accidental death glory remains... stupid dinosaur getting in the way) as does the turret tower-tank segment, where you have a clear shot of the last pole, but can't peg it unless you're in a very specific, next to impossible to reach spot.The original title was \"Conker: Live and Uncut\", with the loss of content, the irritating new combat engine, and all the censorship that took place Rare took a great game and made it mediocre. Little wonder it's not a blockbuster on this system. A note to Microsoft, take a cue from Nintendo, if you do a remake of a previous generation game, don't ruin it! Enhance it!As far as the online player mode, it's really not much to speak of. It's disappointingly scarce in original content, again it suffers from a sluggish dual analogue control scheme, and has little to do besides running around killing, and being killed. Not much of an improvement over the multi-player games of the N64 original.I hate to say it, but the stigmatism that remakes are seldom better than the original holds true here. In typical Hollywood fashion more eye candy does not mean better. The N64 original remains a classic, while this remains a cash cow.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2005"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Nintendo brings it root down.","reviewText":"For a lot of us, Nintendo is another family member. Whether he's an immediate family member or a distant cousin is decided upon how much we adore the franchises they've brought to us. Ultimately, they play some part in our life. So when Nintendo decided to bring back Super Mario to one of his most basic forms on the Nintendo DS, we rejoiced. But now we rejoice for a new reason. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is all that is good in an older Super Mario Bros. adventure, complete with a kidnapped princess, world map, suits, Koopa bosses, and side-scroll platforming.New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a throw back to all that was great from Super Mario Bros. 3. As mentioned, the suits are back, as well as the Koopa kid bosses. The suits are a particular fun way to change up the pace of the game, and never a true necessity, aside from the occasional mushroom. And the Koopa kids, well, they're just a blast from the 90's past. Essentially, this is a title meant to appease the gamers from that generation, and bring a new level of appreciation to the side-scrolling platform games. But how does it fair?And it fairs really well. From start to finish, the game continues to entertain while not punishing the player(s) for getting to the end. This is also one of the rare gems from this generation of gaming that truly gets what co-op is all about. Of course, that would be trying to kill your friends off before the end of that stage. Playing with friends in the game seems to be a game within itself. Not only for the co-op killing that will eventually happen, but the pleasure of being accompanied on the adventure is a true treat.The game is setup in a 2.5D perspective. This means while the game is actually 3D, you still are running down a line to reach an ending. It really feels retro, which is what Nintendo was shooting for. The game works best this way anyway since they've included a 4-player co-op mode. The music and sounds are very retro too, which means this game truly is a blast from the past.The core of the series is here still, with all the tricky jumps, moving platforms, and all of our favorite classic enemies. Not to mention the wall sliding/jumping ability brought to us in New Super Mario Bros. on the DS. There's also a secondary objective to each level, similar to those of Super Mario World. Remember the Yoshi coins? They're back. Collecting them all will lead you to a special world for the more experienced Super Mario players. The best part about each level design is that you'll want to go back and replay them, just to make sure you didn't miss something, or just to see if you can master a speed run. This is truly the same Mario we've grown to love, which means it's the same game we've played before. There's nothing truly new or ground breaking. It doesn't even push Super Mario games to the next level of creativity. But is that really a bad thing? I think not.The game is set up with a total of nine different worlds and environments, with a total of 88 levels. You'll travel through many familiar surroundings from previous games and run into some familiar enemies. This doesn't mean that you're just playing a remake of the same game you've played before. Sure, you'll get your Starman suit, or jump on a few Goombas, but the game's magic is really in the platforming, level designs, and newly developed suits. For instance, in the frozen levels, you can acquire a penguin suit that will allow you to belly-flop onto the ground and skid across entire frozen areas, killing anything in your path. It can also double as the frog suit during swimming sequences. Another suit attaches a propeller to your character, and with the flick of your wrist, sends your character spinning of flying/floating to a new destination.While the game can be challenging in a few spots, the game was a bit too easy for the most part. There's a few levels that will snatch lives from you, but you're never going to be left feeling like the game is impossible. This is a good and bad thing, depending on your play style. What really makes little sense is the addition of the Super Guide mode. It allows the game to play for you, skipping a difficult section or level that is just too tough for you. It's activated when the game realises that you're not any good, and you've died several times on the same level. In the old days, we called the Super Guide the level skip code. But the feature being implemented into the game without some type of cheat code just feels cheap. It takes \"hold your hand\" gameplay to a new level.If you're not taking the simple road to victory, you'll be collecting coins that can be spent at the beginning castle. The things you'll end up buying are videos of secret places throughout the game, or incredible speed runs. The speed runs were jaw-dropping incredible, as a matter of fact. Often times, I wish I had better friends to play with so we could pull off these moves, but no such friends exist.Actually, these friends do exist, just in another state. Nintendo has opted out of including any type of online play, which means you need to plan couch co-op parties to really enjoy the game with friends. This is one of the only draw backs to the game itself, but Nintendo did give a good enough reason of why it wasn't added. In this game, precision is everything. If there's a tiny spike in lag, you're likely to have a character fly off a map or miss a platform that's hard to hit. LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation 3 managed to have online play, but there's not near as much platform jumping involved as in New Super Mario Bros. Wii.You really can't go wrong with a Super Mario adventure usually, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii isn't breaking this trend. For the slightly few things it didn't get correct, it manages to master everything else. This is a full scale Super Mario, and feels like a sequel to the Super Mario Bros. more than just another money grabbing scheme cooked up by a company looking to make some quick cash.+ Classic gameplay from the 21st century.+ Co-op mode is a blast.- You never feel like you're going to \"lose\". Especially with a mode like \"Super Guide\".- No online co-op.Recommendation: Buy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"One of Mario's Finest 2D Adventures","reviewText":"Whenever Nintendo releases a system, you know a Mario game is right around the corner.  Usually Nintendo only gives fans one \"series\" Mario game and the rest are comprised of spin-offs such as Mario Party or something along those lines.  The Super Nintendo had Super Mario World, and while it had a \"sequel\" in Yoshi's Island... it was more Yoshi's game.  The Nintendo 64 received Super Mario 64.  The Gamecube received Super Mario Sunshine.  But the Wii?  Not only did it get Super Mario Galaxy... but it later got New Super Mario Bros. Wii and then Super Mario Galaxy 2.  While the two Galaxy games are 3D Mario adventures, New Super Mario Bros. Wii goes back to the classic 2D days.  If you were a fan of Mario games such as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World in particular, you'll find everything New Super Mario Bros. Wii does to be extremely familiar.The story is the same as always.  Princess Peach--in an attempt to fill up her frequent kidnapping card--gets kidnapped and it's up to the Mario to save her.  Only this time he's joined by Luigi as well as two generic Mushroom people.  Like classic Mario games you'll traverse a world map, going from one level to the next in an attempt to save Princess Toadstool from King Koopa and his Koopalings.  There are eight worlds and one special world.For fans of previous 2D Mario outings, New Super Mario Bros. keeps it simple.  While there are alternate exits in some stages (similar to Super Mario World) there isn't much mystery as to where you might go or anything like that.  You'll know exactly where a hidden exit will lead.  It's not always obvious as to where the hidden exit is in a level, but the wonder of exploring isn't exactly here like in some of Mario's other 2D adventures.  This isn't exactly bad.  It's obviously to make New Super Mario Bros. appeal to newcomers more so than old.Much of what long time fans see here is going to be nostalgic.  When you go into levels familiar power ups are there.  The super mushroom and fire flower are there, as they always are.  But there is also a free flower for those who want it, and a penguin suit as well (which is much better than the blue shell from New Super Mario Bros. on the DS).  They're fun power ups to mess around with, and the ice flower even allows you to pick up frozen enemies and throw them.  Yoshi also makes an appearance here, but it's always something short lived.  After so many years of not being able to ride Yoshi in a Mario game, his appearance in New Super Mario Bros. Wii feels like something they could've done more with.  He doesn't appear in that many levels, and when he does you have to leave him behind when you clear a level.  It's a shame that Yoshi seems to be reduced to what can best be described as a cameo.  At least he's there... it's just a shame he doesn't have any real use.New Super Mario Bros. also has a multiplayer component.  For the first time in Mario history you and your friends can all be moving around screen at once.  One player controls Mario, another controls Luigi while the last two slots are reserved for the generic Mushroom men.  No one character actually plays better than another or is ever more useful.  They all behave the same way as well so there's nothing big here.  New Super Mario Bros on multiplayer can either be the thrill of your life or the most annoying asset ever.  It really depends on who you're playing with.  You'll all four be moving around, but it's pretty easy to get in one another's way or slow someone down.  You can also lift and throw your allies.  Meaning that if one friend is in the way and you're impatient you could essentially carry them through a level... or just toss them in a pit and not have to deal with them.  The desire to mess around with your friends is great, and sometimes giving into that urge can yield some hilarious results (or broken friendships... your choice).  On the other hand, because of the chaotic nature of the multiplayer you'll also screw up unintentionally.  This is especially true if you're playing with veterans of the platforming genre.Which brings about New Super Mario Bros. difficulty level.  Something that has been stated countless times.  If there was ever any proof of a generation gap in gaming, this is probably it.  Chances are, if you missed out on Mario's adventures on the NES and SNES then you'll find the game to be much more challenging.  But veterans of the 2D Mario games will notice the exact same tricks that worked back then... STILL work today.  If you survived through all the challenges of Super Mario World you're probably apt to wonder what exactly is supposed to make New Super Mario Bros. Wii so challenging.  Especially because the game will throw tons of extra lives at you.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii can be a challenge... but not for a Mario veteran.  The difficulty, I'm sorry to say, is greatly exaggerated.That's not to say there's no fun to be had.  In terms of 2D Mario games, these are by far some of the most creative levels you're ever going to find.  Each one throws a new challenge or new twist at you.  It's fast paced and fun.  And you don't mind going through it all again when it's over because they're so much fun.Visually, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is apt to strike most people as just a much more polished version of New Super Bros. on the DS.  It's more than that.  It's got lots of character in its animations.  The cartoon like charm is why it's easy on the eyes to begin with.  The music is also catchy and charming as well.  You might want some slight touch ups with the controls, though.  You'll hold the wii remote like an NES controller.  Running and jumping is the same as in the original games on the NES as well.  The motion controls feel tacked on, though.  From time to time you'll have to tilt the Wii remote when you're on a sail barge, for instance and need to manipulate the light.  You'll have to pick up and throw characters by shaking the Wii remote.  It's not bad, but there are times when it comes off like Nintendo trying to figure out a way to incorporate motion controls into a game that, for the most part, doesn't really need them.In the end, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a fantastic package.  For those who never experienced his 2D adventures, it's a great introduction to them.  For those who already have... it's nostalgia.  There's a little here for just about every one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

Do you want flashy graphics? Look elsewhere. Do you want fun? Find it here, for a price that's easy on the pocketbook.Nintendo has always been about style. The Wii capitalizes on this. I hope the controller is more than a mere hook, but even if it is, what a hook! There is a great synergy (stupid word, I know, but descriptive in this case) between the launch games and the system, something which cannot be said for the bloated PS3. And there is enough novelty here to make it a good alternative to the X-Box 2 (or whatever it's called), which seems now to be hitting its stride.\"Zelda\" is a great game. There is a bit of a learning curve for the controller, as the X-Box afficionado reported. Indeed, it took me a whole 5 minutes to get comfortable with it. And Wii sports is an excellent package - that comes with the system.Don't overpay, though - I just picked mine up yesterday, and they are beginning to hit the stores. Amazon will have theirs soon, and not for the bloated 500 bucks some people here seem to think they'll get after Christmas.To sum it up, Wii is the most fun system out there at the moment. Ultimately, its lack of processing power will hurt it in the long run, methinks, but for the pricetag and the initial launch, it is the big winner.

{"product_name":"B002I0H8FK","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A mesmerizing tapestry of eye candy and a solid shooter!","reviewText":"Child of Eden is simply beautiful.  It's one of those games that has to be seen and experienced simply because it exists.  It's a sonic triumph, a visual masterpiece and it provides a nice challenge too!  And last but not least, it's simply the best title for Kinect, period.The game is essentially an on-rails shooter.  You progress through each level automatically shooting at whatever happens to get in your way.  You do this by controlling a reticle with your hand, using one of two \"weapons\" or a bomb that destroys everything.  The first weapon you use is a targeting weapon using your right hand where you simply pass the reticle over enemies, which targets them.  By flicking your hand towards the screen, you will unleash a devastating attack that damages or destroys whatever you've targeted.  The next is a rapid-fire weapon used with your left hand, which while weaker than the targeting weapon, is highly effective against most foes.  It's also the only weapon that can destroy enemy projectiles, which is required if you want to make it past the first 5 minutes of any level.  An alternate control scheme can be used that allows you to use either your right or left hand to attack, having you clap your hands in order to switch weapons.  In either control scheme, quickly throwing both hands up in the air will execute the bomb attack.  This control scheme works amazingly well, with very close to 1:1 tracking.  It really is the most accurate use of Kinect that I've played.  Don't have Kinect?  You can use your regular controller too, with weapons mapped to face buttons while you control your reticle with the left stick.  This also works very well, thought it's more sluggish than using Kinect.  It's pretty clear though...this game is really meant for motion controls.The game's simple story essentially revolves around freeing the online consciousness of a girl named Lumi from corruption in the internet, now called Eden.  This must be done through five levels called Archives.  Each level takes approximately 10 minutes to do.  You have a health indicator, and if it runs out the game is over and you must restart each level from the beginning.  Completing a level will earn you stars and unlock bonus content.  Levels are opened up by getting the required number of stars and completing the level before it.  This means that you will have to replay some levels multiple times in order to get more stars...but don't be discouraged.  Stars earned on a repeated level are added to what you've already earned.  Finishing the fifth level unlocks a bonus sixth level which is more akin to a series of challenges where you just have to survive as long as you can.  This sixth level ensures that the game has replay value because you WANT to keep trying!Playing this game is definitely sensory overload.  Each level is simply gorgeous, with the visuals getting progressively more beautiful as the levels progress.  The music is trancy and dreamy and is the perfect backdrop for the rich visuals this game boasts.  It is very nice to have a game that's different like this one is.Overall, this is a game that any Kinect owner should definitely play.  The only downside of it is its short length, which sadly is typical of rail shooters.  My hope is that the game will be successful and that it'll prompt Ubisoft to make a longer, meatier sequel.  Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

Sure it looked and sounded good, but that first impression was that it was just an update. As I let the game load into the player introductions and could check everything out, I thought the players looked pretty good, courts, arenas, etc. were all nice. Once I was able to start playing, NBA2K14 came to life.I love this series. The game plays so well, the classic players are awesome and the presentation is top noch. For 2k14, I absolutely love the weight of the players. More than any game I've ever played, the guy I'm controlling can be have correctly. I've never been interested in scoring 100 points a game with a player. I want real stat lines, real defense, open shots to go in, bad shots to be punished. I want players to steal bad passes, but I don't want them to automatically steal a ball that hits them in the back. I don't want Mario Chalmers or Steve Blake to out score Kobe or LeBron. All of these issues have been fixed. Smart play and good substitutions are rewarded. My only knock is the same one that has been present in NBA games for years, bad AI substitutions. LeBron does not come out with 3 minutes left in the 4th of a close game...ever. Yet the AI seems to gift me with those types of substitutions regularly. Once I get through 82 games, maybe the AI will prove me wrong.From a presentation standpoint, this is one of those &#34;whoa&#34; games. In action, it's stunning. In my opinion, this and BF4 are very close for best looking launch game. Killzone also looks awesome, but making real people that we all recognize look this natural is impressive.All in, I absolutely love NBA2K14.

There are major improvements from the original such as the screen size which is amazing and the top screen is about the same size as the vita just maybe slightly bigger or smaller can't tell. With this bigger screen size it makes the 3d MUCH easier on the eyes but I still find myself playing with the 3d off unless I'm playing a Nintendo made game. As for the graphics besides the 3d is slightly better then the Wii which is great for a portable console. The vita however is Superior with graphics which is basically a watered down handheld ps3. The battery on the 3ds xl has been improved as well from the original 3ds maybe not enough to throw your old 3ds out and run to get the new one but its still quite nice and gives it a little edge over the vita. The speakers on the system though haven't been improved over the original and aren't all that great. I would recommend a good pair of headphones with this expecilly if you plan on using the music player.I personally love both the vita and the 3ds but the 3ds xl is my new favorite console of this generation because of the awesome games that have came out on it. Yes there are a onslaught of remakes like Zelda ocarina of time 3d and star fox 64 3d which have been extremly improved and feel new again and are perfect for people who were to young when the 64 was out, but there are plenty of new games to keep anybody happy such as Kid Icarus (haven't played yet but heard it was awesome), Super Mario 3d Land, Resident Evil Revelations, Mario Kart 7, Luigi's mansion dark moon, Fire Emblem, Ghost Recon shadow wars, pushmo, Monster Hunter 3 and many more.

Once again my eye was caught when it was announced that Jimmy Urine, the lead singer of Mindless Self Indulgence, would be doing the boss music for the game and the voice of one of the bosses. As well, there was a lot of hype for this game across the internet and at game expos. To me, this looked one of those games that could be really good or really bad. After playing through it a couple times I can say it falls in the middle but on the good side of the middle. This game is dripping with style. It has a comic book like theme and feel and it really works with the characters and graphics of the game. It feels like Bayonetta, Scott Pilgrim, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and a pinch of The Evil Dead thrown into a blender. It's a very silly game that doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should the player. The game play is generally fun and moves at a good pace. First, let's take a look at why and what is happening in this game.STORY: You play as Juliet Starling who is the lead cheerleader for the San Romero High School and also happens to come from a family of zombie hunters. Today is also her 18th birthday but when she gets to school the freakin' zombie apocalypse has started! Good thing she was carrying her super magical and multipurpose chainsaw! At this point you might be thinking `WOW! This sounds really stupid!' well it gets better. Her boyfriend, Nick, gets bit by a zombie and in order to save him she cuts his head off and casts a magical spell to keep him alive as a severed head attached to her hip. Turns out this goth kid at her school (who looks like a Marilyn Mason wannabe) is casting an evil spell on the school to get his revenge on society and it's up to Juliet, Nick, and her family of zombie hunters to stop them.  Now like I said, this game doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time. Now I know people who like to keep their zombies more serious and this story is probably very much a turn off for them. This game certainly isn't for everyone but this is where the style over substance comes into the play. All the zombie bosses that are summoned set up the themes for all the levels and all have music themes. For example there is a Punk rock zombie and an 80's funk zombie. Also these boss zombies remind me of avatars from Guitar Hero 3. It has fairly good character development and I enjoy the banter between Juliet and Nick throughout the game. Only problem is that it is a short game and it comes to an end pretty quickly.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is generally a hack and slash type game. Juliet's move list starts out very limited but you game new abilities and can buy new moves as the game progresses.  You buy moves, items, and unlockables with zombie medals which you earn by killing zombies. There are gold medals which are most common to buy moves and health items and there are silver medals which are used to buy unlockables, they are much more rare.  You kill 3 or more zombies at once and you will be rewarded with a brief slow-mo cut scene and gold and silver medals known as `sparkle hunting' and I won't lie, it's very satisfying when you pull one of these off.The levels themselves linear but have some variety in gameplay though they aren't always so fun. One level you are in an arcade and get sucked into old 80's style arcade games throughout the level.  In another level you drive a thresher and run over zombies in a wheat field. The one I hated was zombie basketball where you have to decapitate enough zombie heads and throw them into a basketball hoop before the time runs out. Not all moves decapitate zombies and you are racing against the clock and if you lose, you die. This took me several frustrating continues to get past this part. One big issue I have with the game is that it is short. My first play through it took me 8 hours to beat. My second play through it took me about 5 or 6 hours which sadly is pretty common these days for games. It encourages multiple play troughs with all the unlockables and two different endings and difficulty settings but for a lot of people once will probably feel like enough and the unlocks really don't give that much incentive to play again. Another big problem I have with the gameplay is heavy on quick time events. This game is filled with QTEs that result in instant death so you gotta be ready. There are also lots of little mini-games involving putting Nick on a zombie body to perform some task but it's just one long annoying QTE. If you HATE QTEs you will probably not like this game at all but if you don't mind them then it shouldn't hurt how much fun you are having ripping up zombies with a chainsaw. The best parts of the game are the bosses. These are some kick ass boss battles with interesting music themed bosses and multi-stage fights. Easily the best parts of the game.GRAPHICS: COLORFUL RAINBOWS! This game has lots of sparkle and flash to it but it all works with the comic book theme. The character models look really good with that cell shaded look and the zombie bosses are very well designed. The levels are a bit more on the bland side. Aside from the arcade level, none of the levels stand out too much visually and there is some texture pop-in going in a few of them. I really like the main menu and level select design though, once again with that comic book theme. The animation on the characters is great and flows well with the combat and gameplay. While the environments could have been better, the characters look great.SOUND: This game has an AWESOME soundtrack. Along with some great original music, there is also licensed music such as the song Lollipop by Julius Dixon that plays during the online store sections. Boy that will get stuck in your head. Hey Micky You're so Fine plays when you're invisible for some extra laughs. But there is also a lot of metal and punk music that fills the soundtrack such as Dragonforce and Children of Bodem that all just fits the style of the game so well. You can unlock and arrange all the music as well and create your own background music play list. The voice acting is also really well done for the most part. Tara Strong does a creating Juliet and bringing her to life and the voice actor for Nick is hilarious. Jimmy Urine does the voice of the Punk Rock zombie and his dialogue is just filled with all sorts of naughty language which he does use to literally attack you with. Also, if you don't like profanity, you really wouldn't like this game.OVERALL: Lollipop Chainsaw is a flawed game but it is fun and super stylish. Like I've said, this game isn't for everyone but if you don't take the story too seriously and just want a mindlessly zombie hack and slash good time you'd probably enjoy it.Score 6.9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007SRM5U6","reviewerName":"Facelord","summary":"Great game, compares favorably to the PC version","reviewText":"It's Arkham City. Most people agree that it's game of the year for 2011 so the &#34;Game of the Year Edition&#34; text on the box is warranted. It's the best superhero game I've ever played(except maaaaybe inFamous 2 and Gravity Rush), the visuals are lovely, the voice acting is great, the writing is mostly spectacular and the gameplay is top-notch, easily the best brawler game I've ever played as well.One thing to note that the PS3 version actually compares pretty favorably to the PC version, even with DirectX 11 features, anti-aliasing, 1080p support and all that jazz in the PC version- if you have a fairly high-end PC like mine. It doesn't really look much worse beyond some jaggies, the framerate is fluid and I didn't notice any pop-up in the PS3 version. The textures look great since Unreal Engine 3 is so good at texture streaming(as long as you don't zoom in close and stare) and the animations are right on par with the PC version; best of all you don't have to install 17gb to play the game on PS3 as you would on PC, just pop in the bluray disc and have fun(can't remember if there's a small install or not, gonna have to check that later; I'll update when I do).Overall, I think I prefer the PS3 version. I get the game on disc without any DRM like Steam and I don't have to eat up nearly 20gb of data on my system. No company gets to decide whether or not I get to keep my &#34;digital license to download the game&#34; since it's a physical disc, that's priceless to me after some horrible experiences with Steam.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The serie's beautiful entrance into PS2","reviewText":"One of the most popular RPG and game series ever has hit the big 10, a rarity among the gaming industry. Also rare is the fact that each one has been GOOD. So when the series made the jump from Playstation to Playstation 2, how would it celebrate its milestone? By creating beautiful graphics, controversial changes and don't forget the graphics.Story: Tidus(pronounced Tee-dus), is in a city called Zanarkand doing a Blitzball tournament(a popular sport). Soon Sin, a monstrous beast destroys the city and Tidus gets swept away. Now he's in the same world but different time meeting people who've banded together to stop Sin.Graphics: Holy crap! There's SOO many gorgeous FMV's that it would be awesome to see it on a big screen, or IMAX thing. Great FMV moments including the Zanarkand attack, the group travelling through the city through a holograph and a little romantic meeting in a moonlit pond. In-game graphics are great too, although mouth movements are off. Speaking of which....Sound/Music: The first Final Fantasy to feature voice acting....and it blows. The characters sound so lifeless as if the actors just read the lines. Tidus sounds like he's a 12 year old immature boy, Yuna sounds BORED and Wakka plays the stereotypical Jamaican. The music isn't bad, but I can't remember any of it, unlike VII's score.Gameplay: MAJOR revamps. The Active Time Battle menu is gone, in its place, a meter to the side which shows who's turn is it and coming up so you won't have to make rash decisions about whether to cure or attack. You can switch in characters who aren't up to snuff or not adaptable to that enemy: Auron hits the enemy hard but is slow, Tidus is fast, Wakka is the only one who can hit airborne enemies etc.And there's the completely gone Level system. You know: get so much EXP, gain a level? It's gone. In it's place is the Sphere Grid, a massive spiderweb-like maze that when you gain a sphere level, you move one. It seems great and all but poses a problem: how would you know you're tough enough against a boss if you have no idea if you are? So it's trial and error basicallyDespite those minor mishaps, it's got quite a fairly interesting story, gorgeous graphics, and a new spin on the series in case you got sick of the last ones","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the Wii's finest titles","reviewText":"For the longest time, I wasn't that into Resident Evil. I have vague memories of playing 2 and 3 but for some reason, I didn't get into them the way I did Final Fantasy and Zelda. The original release of Resident Evil 4 on the Gamecube sort of brought me back, not because I finally rediscovered the series but rather there was just simply nothing else out there. Well now it's back on the Wii and it actually makes what was a great experience on the Gamecube even better with a much better emphasis on control and aiming and since the game was a good play anyway, it's a worthy purchase.Story: Taking place 6 years after the incident in Raccoon City (depicted in RE 2 and 3), former police officer Leon Kennedy is on a mission to rescue the President's daughter Ashley Graham who's been recently kidnapped. But getting in was fairly easy while finding her and getting the two of you out alive is another story as there's strange villagers and bizarre creatures out to make sure you don't leave.Graphics: While it doesn't push the Wii to its limits the way the Gamecube one did, this edition is just as impressive with detailed character models and physics as well as superb use of lighting and fog to help create the mood. Also, since the series is finally in full 3D, there's more depth to the environment and while occasionally a blurry texture will show up, it's still looks as good as it did.Sound/Music: The series has always been about B-movie dialogue and like voice acting and with such lines as \"you're small time!\" and \"you're right hand comes off?\" complete with typo, it's always strange playing a RE game with great atmosphere and tension yet it has the most laughable of plot presentation. The music is a bit different as well since some of it, namely the more action-y theme when things get hectic is meant to get your heart racing whereas before it had more of an ambient feel to it.Gameplay: Pretty much everything's the same since the GC/PS2 ones came out. With the camera behind Leon the entire time instead of preset angles, the game has a pseudo-FPS feel to it that feels more natural and while running-while-shooting mechanics would be much welcome one day, you never feel like you can't hit enemies like the old days because your aim was off. And with the action being amped with plenty of ammo and naturally, plenty of enemies, the new gameplay style as well as the Wii controls make it more enjoyable to play. My one complaint is that while ammo is plentiful, other things are not such as grenades. Always useful with scores of enemies, at times they seemed like there wasn't enough and since enemies don't always die when shot in the head or even quite a few chest shots, it's annoying for crowd control.As far as the actual game itself, it's more intense than creepy since you'll find yourself getting adrenaline-pumped and antsy in new areas but after awhile, it feels kind of, I don't know, same-y? When you reach a whole new area halfway a good chunk in the game and have a whole new area to explore, it feels somewhat stretched out and it almost kills the pacing. Puzzles are thankfully not as oddball and out-of-place (seriously, who builds a room with enclosing walls inside a mansion?) with really the only puzzles coming from equipment management. For the first time, the weapons can be upgraded with features such as firepower, capacity and reload time being available to be \"tuned up\" so you have to wonder...is it better to save my money knowing a better gun will be on sale soon or upgrade my lowly shotgun then sell it at a high price later? Luckily, your enemies apparently are rich buggers so money usually isn't an issue.With Assignment Ada, Separate Ways and the popular Mercenaries plus the main game, there's very little reason to not buy the Wii edition of probably one of the better games to get for the Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1QY","description":"Nintendo certainly has added a quirky spin on the old English game withMario Tennis. With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.

It's clean and polished, and, most importantly, incredibly enjoyable to play.If you're not into &quot;realistic&quot; tennis games - by that, I mean games which look realistic - this game has to be one of the best tennis games for any console out there.  The controls are clean and still simple, there is a wide variety of characters, all with different characteristics, to choose from, and the variety of gameplay modes all add to the fun.Playing against the computer can be amusing for a while, but where this game really shines is multiplayer mode.  If you have someone of comparable skill to play with, this game is loads of fun.  There's nothing quite like winning a tiebreaker to win a hard-earned match, and then being able to trash talk to the person right next to you!The physics is also good.  There are different courts with varying ball speed and bounce, so, like in real life, court composition makes a very significant difference in style of play.All these features make a game which is fun to play and can still last for dozens of hours.

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Amer","summary":"Better than Rockband 3","reviewText":"Playing guitar has been one of my life long dreams. I tried to learn guitar on and off for almost 13 years now. I used everything to learn guitar including youtube videos, DVDs, books and lessons from friends (not pro but still).Then last year, Rockband 3 came out which works with a real guitar. I never played Rockband games before but went out bought $300 Rockband guitar and $40 midi controller and the game. Initial lessons in Rockand 3 were easy but I quickly hit the wall. The cool thing was that Rockband would let me slowdown the song speed and let me learn at slower pace. However, there were 2 flaws with this approach. It was very boring. Sometimes even the slowest speed was not slow enough for me. After a while I got bored with Rockband and listed the guitar, midi controller and game on the Craig's list. It was time to call it quit.One guy came to my place to check out the guitar and the game. While he was testing the game, he mentioned Rocksmith. And said he thought it was a better game. Luckily, he didn't buy the guitar.I searched a bit on Rocksmith. I decided what the heck, let's try it out.At first, I was just following their main journey and sucking at every song. Then I discovered Riff Repeater menu. This changed my world. Normally, first, I try Leveler. There I learn a part of a song until it becomes too difficult to finish at the full speed. Then I go to Free Speed option and practice until I can finish the song at full speed. In Free Speed, it slows down if you make a mistake. This combo has been best for me, so far. For some reason, difficulty level rises smoother than Rockband 3 and I don't feel I am getting stuck anywhere for too long.Well actually I did get stuck. I was hitting right notes on low E sting but it was registering those notes slightly off. Guitar was tuned perfectly. So I thought there was a bug in the game or perhaps my Rockband 3 guitar was broken. But unlike Rockband 3, this game had given me enough confidence to say that it wasn't me but something else. After some search I found out that most likely the E string needs to be intonated. I had no idea what it meant but learned something new. If you are having same issue where you hit the right notes but the game register it slightly off, then most likely you need to get your guitar intonated too.I have been playing Duck Hunter a lot too. It helps in moving fingers fast and building muscle memory.Okay some flaws: as others have noted, it does have a slightly long loading time. I wish, in Riff Reapter there were no lives. You can play as long as you need to get it perfect. Right now after 5 tries, it exit and you have to load it again. I wish game had more guitar basics or troubleshooting options. Like help with intonating a guitar.In the end, I feel like I can learn guitar finally. If you want to know how much fun this game is, I have stopped playing Uncharted 3 half way since I got this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}
