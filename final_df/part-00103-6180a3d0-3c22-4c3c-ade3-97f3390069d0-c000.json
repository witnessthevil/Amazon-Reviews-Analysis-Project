{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"M. Boone \"DaClint\"","summary":"AWESOME GAME!!!","reviewText":"This is a very fun game. It is like a combo of a strategy war game and a Grand Theft Auto game.Basically, the plot is to catch (dead or alive) the deck of 52 and complete missions for The Allies (The AN, like the UN in real life), South Korea, The Russian Mafia (has their own website to order supplies so they're good to work for), and China. You can switch who you want to work with time to time but make sure to not become enemies with other countries.A really fun part of this game is you get paid for completing objectives like stealing a North Korean missile truck, blowing up North Korean tanks, eliminate the Russian Mafia captains, blowing up pretty much anything (except civilians or AN troops), and more.While not on a mission, you can do side missions to earn extra cash and drive around to find a person from the deck of 52. You can kill a member of the deck of 52 but you only get half the cash so bringing them alive is a lot better.Every car is \"steal-able\" and certain cars give you a certain disguise like a civilian, a North Korean, and as any of the other countries.You choose from three characters to play as through the whole game. One has more armor, one is more stealthier, and one a the fastest. This game is a lot of fun.It's just like Grand Theft Auto but with an international plot. I give this game five out of five stars without a doubt.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2005"}

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Puts the AC Franchise Back on Track, Mateys!","reviewText":"Count me among the fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise left frustrated and scratching their heads after AC: III.  Uneven pacing and clumsy gameplay threatened to toss out all of the greatness that the Ezio trilogy had built up.  However, Ubisoft Montreal puts the franchise back on track with AC: IV, Black Flag, a game that continues the adventurous spirit of historical action and fixes the problems of the past version.Gameplay is the familiar AC recipe of open world missions bound together by a core story.  The story is another good one (who doesn't want to be a pirate?) and the side missions provide the necessary variety.  Combat mechanics are similar to the best of the AC franchise but with even a little bit more challenge in the timing.The sea setting provides the real differentiator here, providing a fresh backdrop to the familiar gameplay.  Missions occur underwater, battles occur ship-to-ship, and suddenly the same franchise feels like a whole new game.  And did I mention that everyone wants to be a pirate?Completists should know that while the historical aspects of the game occur chronologically prior to AC: III, the modern-day frame story occurs after AC: III.  The current plot is somewhat downplayed as well.  But while you might be tempted to skip III altogether, you should do a quick flyby on it anyway.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag will make you forget all about the AC: III misstep and give you hours of sea-farin' adventure along with familiar AC gameplay that makes the game fresh and approachable all at once.  A must-have for fans of the series or anyone who enjoys open-world adventuring (or who ever wanted to be a pirate).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

Some criticize that they just altered the Levels from NSMBU.  Who cares!? the level design from the Mario version is amazing and is super fun.  The altered physics and altered levels make this worth every penny to me as the whole game plays differently, and there is an added time constraint; making continuous progression a do-or-die scenario.  It's super fun and now that me friend and I have 100% completed the Mario campaign, we're going to try to do it for Luigi U (yea the thought scares me a bit).My only complaint, is that they could have at least re-worked the bosses too.  Knowing how to out-fox the same bosses moves (If you played Mario Bros U) sort of takes away from the end of world reward, but it's still fun nonetheless.I recommend that people supplement their New Super Mario Bros U game with this Super Luigi U DLC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}

This time, our Prince is hunted by Dahaka, an immortal incarnation of Fate. The spirit seeks retirbution against the Prince, but he is wiser and deadlier than he was. To avoid his preordained death, he'll travel to the infernal core of mankind's worst fears.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Unleash the warrior within","reviewText":"Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the middle chapter of Ubisoft's new genre-defining trilogy, and is notable for being the installment that upset many fans with its hardcore approach to violence and darker theme. After the events of the first game, the Prince is now being hunted by the minions of time, and must travel to the Island of Time to change his fate.I personally don't mind the darker approach. Some of the cursing and sexuality seem a bit tacked on, but otherwise the story is compelling (and convoluted) enough that the darker approach makes sense. It helps that the art direction is still stunning, with twisted beasts including giant ogres and a raging griffin. This time the player is allowed to manipulate time to visit environments in the past and present, and Ubisoft did a fantastic job building golden, shining arenas that also turn into crumbling, vine-covered ruins.Gameplay is also equally refined. The jumping, running, swinging that defined the first game is back, and it's just as fun to get through environments as before. Combat has seen a slight upgrade, as the player now has more control over their swordplay, as well as the ability to deliver some truly satisfying finishing moves. It also helps that Ubisoft cut down on the number of enemies that spawn into an area at a given time, and there's more chances now of skipping combat altogether. It's still not perfect, and is still very annoying at times, but definite improvement has been made.But the game has one drawback, and that's the amount of backtracking involved during the quest. To be fair, it's not always the backtracking of games like Resident Evil. You reach an area, accomplish a goal, then backtrack out of the area because its built into the story structure. You also go through environments in different time periods, which vary the environmental puzzles and keeps things fresher. However, in the end it still feels like there could've been a bit more variety. And if you want the life upgrades, unlockables, and secret weapons, there's even more backtracking involved. The last quarter of the game ups the difficulty significantly if players don't max out their life bar. And only with all the life upgrades can the game's best ending be achieved.Overall I enjoyed Warrior Within and found it a worthy installment in the series. A compelling story and fun gameplay win over some repetitive backtracking. If you can accept or look past the game's violence and attempt to be edgy, this one's worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2006"}

David Swan","summary":"Square Hits a Home Run","reviewText":"The first thing that struck me about `The World Ends With You' is the high quality of the production values. This is a one slick looking game. The next thing that hit me was how complicated the game is. I tend to prefer simpler RPG's like Paper Mario and the fantastic Mario and Luigi games but once you get past the moderate learning curve this is an awesome game. It's also a game the devilishly hard to put down.As with just about every RPG ever created the meat of the game involves battles and leveling up. The action takes place on both the top and bottom screens. The top screen is managed using the directional pad while the lower requires the stylus. Players are given the choice as to which screen to control while the action in the opposite screen is taken care of by the system. I would generally switch back and forth in mid battle. The stylus attacks are more fun and powerful but the directional pad attacks can allow for devastating synced attacks. It all works very well and has yet to grow tedious. As a player gets more confident in fighting she can chain battles to fight multiple enemies in a row for greater rewards.The rewards for battles include the standard experience points, cash and treasure but you also get experience points for the pins you bring to the fight. Pins? Pins are a way to customize your attacks. By attaching one or more pins you can employ various attacks including flames, ice, bullets using motions of the stylus. Most pins are upgradable through experience and some even evolve into more powerful pins.The game I'm most reminded of playing TWEWY is the classic River City Ransom and that is high praise indeed. The game involves traveling around a city, fighting battles and purchasing clothes, foods and pins to increase your fighting abilities. River City Ransom was one of the all time great games and I always wondered why its formula wasn't emulated more. I'm not sure that the developers of The World had River City Ransom in mind when they created this game but it certainly was on mine while I played it.This is one of the best handheld RPG's I've ever played. The story is very good if a bit more verbose than I usually like. The best thing I can say about this game is I never got bored and that's not always the case with RPG's. There is so much character building in the game whether it be upgrading your pins, creating relationships with salespeople or just increasing your attack and defense stats. I would have to put this game in the must get category for RPG fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Stylish Super Sexy Action Game of the Year Nominee!","reviewText":"Imagine Devil May Cry 4 or Ninja Gaiden 2 if the main character was a gun-toting, sword wielding, black magic using, stripper-witch.  If that sounds like a good time, then you should love this game.Story:  6/10The weakest part of Bayonetta is the convoluted story.  It tells an epic 500 year long tale about the Umbra Witches, the Lumen Sages, Heaven, Hell, Earth, and magic jewels called the Eyes of the World.  There's enough story here for a Bioware RPG, downloadable content, and a costly expansion.  Unfortunately, there are only six main characters and it feels like there are three too many.  Basically, the gods are control freaks and Bayonetta tries to save the world by battling angelic warriors.  What saves the story is that Bayonetta doesn't really take anything seriously, she just cracks jokes, struts around like a fashion model, pole dances, and kills things by the hundreds.  Although the entire universe is in danger, Bayonetta still manages to have fun the entire time.  In one scene, the main characters are in a plane that is about to crash.  A dramatic sound effect plays, \"Dun Dun\" and they zoom in on Luka, who looks terrified.  \"Dun Dun\" and they zoom in on a little girl, clinging desperately to her stuffed animal.  \"Dun Dun\" they zoom in on Bayonetta's cleavage! But, if the lack of story bothers you, you'd be the kind of person who'd bring a book to a strip club and complain that it's too dark to read.Characters:  9/10Bayonetta, Jeanne, and Cereza are great, others are forgettable.Bayonetta is an instant videogame icon.  She's beautiful, powerful, sexy, intelligent, fun, and extremely entertaining.  Clad in an outfit made of gold chains and magical hair, she looks and moves like a stripper.  Her hair is the source of her power; as she performs long combination attacks or powerful magic spells, her hair disappears from her outfit and attacks the enemies, leaving her wearing next to nothing.  After she completes these attacks, her outfit rematerializes.  Her accessories are great, from her black cat earrings, her butterfly glasses, and her high heels made of magical automatic weapons that never run out of bullets.  Bayonetta's primary attacks involve acrobatics, guns, martial arts, magic, and bladed weapons.  She can acrobatically jump 30 feet into the air, perform a 20 hit sword combo, and shoot 10 enemies with the guns on her feet before she lands.  If that's not enough, Bayonetta also shapeshifts into a flock of ravens or a black panther complete with blood red nail polish.  Her dialogue and voice acting are outstanding.  Everything about her screams the perfect hostess for a good time.Jeanne is a rival witch who appears in the game as an ally and a boss character.  She shares many of the same attributes as Bayonetta.Cereza is THE CUTEST little girl to every appear in a game... EVER!The rest of the characters provide some comic relief and are a mixed bag.Gameplay:  10/10Bayonetta's gameplay is amazing!  Because she attacks with her hands, feet, magic hair, swords, blades, gun heels, spells, etc... She has the most potential to be the deadliest video game character of all time.  She's up there with Kratos from God of War.The game relies on a combo system based on pressing the hand, foot, jump, and shoot buttons.  Anyone can easily pull off impressive looking 20 hit combos.  Many of the combos can be linked together to perform 40 or 60 hit combos if you have some skill.  There is no block, just an evade button.  If you evade just before an attack hits you, the game slows down for a few seconds, allowing you to counterattack enemies.  Bayonetta's enemies are ruthless and complement her attack styles.  Most action games have cookie-cutter throwaway enemies that perform simple attacks.  You can tell, that a lot of effort was made to suit the enemies to Bayonetta's fighting style from the minions to the gigantic bosses.  This results in GREAT FUN!You can upgrade Bayonetta with more weapons, spells, items, attacks, etc...  There are enough upgrades in the game to warrant three playthroughs if you want to collect `em all.When some enemies are killed, Bayonetta can wield their weapons as well.  Polearms, massive swords, bows, axes, demonic claws, etc...As you play through the levels, you collect potion components, and halos that you can use to create or buy items.  There are temporary power ups, like health, limited invincibility, magic, improved damage, that come in the form of suckers... because Bayonetta likes to suck on things.  It sure beats the typical \"stepping on a first aid kit\" that old shooters used to have.  You can also buy items that boost Bayonetta's Max Health, or Max Magic.  So, if part of the game is too difficult, you are free to replay an easier level and \"farm it\" for halos.  Bayonetta can also buy more outfits, weapons, spells, attack moves, etc...Level Designs:  9/10The levels are amazing set pieces to showcase the action.  There are destructible areas, hidden spell components, halos, power-ups...  The art style is similar to Devil May Cry.  The levels are linear and it's almost impossible to get lost.  Aside from the action levels, there are also, driving, shooting, and flying levels as well.  At the end of each level, you get a grade and a bonus based on your time, combo points, and damage that you took.  You're free to replay levels if you want to get a better award.Bayonetta can also \"Witch Walk.\"  This allows her to run on walls and ceilings, which makes some of the levels even more dynamic and over the top.  In one level, a city floods with lava and you run on the sides of buildings while performing acrobatics and fighting angels.Reward Systems:  8/10Bayonetta's rewards are great, but this system would have worked much better in an open ended game like GTA, Red Faction, Fallout 3...  At times, you may want to farm levels to collect money for an upgrade.  This really encourages you to break the game's story continuity and replay levels while skipping cutscenes.  It's a minor gripe because the upgrades and reward systems are very well done.Replay Value: 7/10If you like action games, the combat system, weapons, and reward system are good enough to play over and over and over.  Playing through on Normal Mode is just short of 10 hours.  Bayonetta's combat system is so deep, it warrants 18 levels and 5 difficulty settings.  You can keep playing to unlock new weapons, techniques, outfits, and compete on the Xbox Live Leaderboards.Sound:  8/10Some of the music tracks are epic and fun, while a few others don't quite fit.  Most of the voice acting is great!  The explosions, demonic sounds, gunfire, collapsing buildings... all punctuate the action.Maturity:  MThe game is sexy and suggestive, but there aren't any sex scenes.  Instead the game is playful and fun.  There are loads of gore and some harsh language.  This is for late teens and adults.Overall: 9.5/10Bayonetta's character design, combat system, and determination to make the player have a great time, make it a strong contender for Action Game of the Year.  It's one of the most entertaining games beat-em up games that I've ever played.Buy this game if you like great action games like Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, or God of War.Rent it if you have 10-12 hours, love AAA Action Titles, and have commitment issues.Avoid it if you hate fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000QUYHIK","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Brain-Twisting Fun","reviewText":"Last year, gamers really started to go wild for the Nintendo DS all over again. Not just because of the DS which was redesigned into the DS Lite, but a whole new era of mental challenge games attracted new gamers young and old. Mainly, with Brain Age, the Nintendo DS got older gamers into the scheme of gaming and excitement from verbal memory games, to introducing Su Doku, the challenging puzzle game that have really made gamers go wild. Unfortunately, there have been many knockoffs to Brain Age like Mind Quiz for the PSP, that really haven't delivered and attracted the feeling that Brain Age delivered. Now, a sequel to the original mind bender that started it all, returns to the Nintendo DS, but is it good as it was before, or falls short on memory?Brain Age 2 for the Nintendo DS tackles on more exciting puzzles than before. The gameplay is expanded nicely, but there are also a lot of changes to the gameplay here in the game. The first main change is that a lot of the verbal games like the color strooping exam were removed, because there were a lot of problems with the microphone use in the game. Instead, there are a lot more games that feed off nicely from Nintendo's other DS mind-bender Big Brain Academy here, where you have to comprehend how much you have to give back as change in dollars and cents, to memorizing a song on a piano. Another new game is called word wheel, where you have a series of letters spinning around, and you have to fill in the exact word, one letter at a time. There are also a few things that have returned here, including the picture drawing challenges, but especially the Su Doku puzzles, withe over 100 new puzzles to test your mind. The graphics are just as simple as they were before, but the gameplay is just even more addictive than it has been before, and the control also handles that just as well.All in all, with so many mental games in the video game market right now, Brain Age 2 really does deliver nicely for the Nintendo DS. If you haven't tackled the challenges before, you may want a new mind-reading workout. I loved the original one, and I really like the new addictive challenges. I absolutely suggest you buy this sequel, and keep that brain sharp.Graphics: BSound: B 1/2+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2007"}

As many have said, this game is completely different from RF: G but has its own positives/negatives. The RPG elements (e.g. ability to upgrade abilities) is light and it's difficult to tell what impacts some of the upgrades actually have.+ Good physics engine and effects+ Cool vehicle/rail sequences- Forgettable plot- Repetitive enemies that can cause boredom and frustration- Tight corridors get old quickly- Unfulfilled potential with physics engine- Save system is flawedI must admit that about 80% through the game, the hoards of seemingly endless enemies (same ones you've been fighting for the last 8 hours or so) really frustrated and bored me to the point that I decide to quit playing and spend my time on something else. I've never been a \"completist\" so it didn't bother me to quit early given the entertainment factor has dissolved. One huge negative is the save system. You are led to believe you can \"save anywhere\" which would have been extremely helpful as you can die several times fighting hoards and hoards of enemies. However, the save only saves the last checkpoint, which in my observation is the same progress that the autosave features saves at. This means you WILL replay large segments of the game fighting the same annoying bugs!All in all, I can only give this game a 3. Worth a try but the appeal definitely won't last. If RF series comes back, I hope the developers take full advantage of the physics engine and make a better game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2011"}

Sure you do sneaking around but the franchise has  a history of being story driven. So if you like a strong story then this is the game for you. It is a cinematic experience mixed with clever gameplay.Graphically the game was superior in its day and really had a lot of clever level design. Sound was simply amazing and the cutscenes are well animated. Some may not like the slowness of the gameplay as its not a run and gun game. It is a stealth game which requires sneaking around and you have various objectives. The main goals are usually to not get caught. The series has always had great art style and this game is flourishing in that category.The difficulty can be extremely hard on higher settings. The manual for the game is in depth unlike games today in 2009. It goes over a wide variety of information that comes in handy for quick reference. I started this series on the PS1 and continued it on the XBOX and onto the PS2 with #3. I wished I had the cash to pick up a PS3 so I could play #4 in the series. But until that time comes I will keep coming back to this game as I have been for 5 and a half years.  This game is simply phenomenal in all aspects and it has great graphics,presentation,sound and gameplay mixed perfectly. With whats all involved it leaves you with a high capacity of replay value that is hard to find in modern games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

I must say that this game drastically exceeded my expectations after I witnessed its wonderfully profane and sinister ways.  The violence that it propagates is greatly unparalelled because even though the GTA series had a deluge of vicious tactics, they were not executed in such an authentic and realistic manner.  The various weapons and techniques that you are granted in Manhunt are great anemities that contribute to the general positive experience of the game.  Another rewarding aspect of the game is the stealth.  It's very gratifying to sneak up on a skinhead and dismember him, without him even having the satisfaction of seeing it coming.

I see a lot of people here give the game low stars due to the difficulty. I wonder if people ever do any research anymore? Did they even play part 1 or even bother to look into the game and the difficulty before they purchased it for their 3 year old?Yes the game is hard. It will punish you. It demands patience, skills and study of the levels. Poor 10 year old kids who are used to games holding their hand and skipping to the end. Anyone remember the NES days? I had Castlevania as a kid and would play that over and over until I had it down to a science. Zelda II anyone? I got half way through that as a kid and also beat Zelda 1.The point is kids and adults should not run from a challenge but instead keep at it until you finally beat a level and get that feeling of accomplishment. Will they pass the game? Maybe not now but at least they tried.Compared to the Wii game this one seems tighter. It controls smoother and the level design also feels great. The levels are longer but you can tell Retro had gotten the level design down now. Just watch any of the speed runs and you will realize that the game is difficult but with time completely beatable and even mastered. People in those time runs are amazing. A joy to watch.Give this game a try and don't give up. Try some of the items to help you. Have patience and attack a level a different way or with a different character. You won't regret it once you chip away at it and beat it. Much more rewarding than a game you can just run through the end with no challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2014"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"More like Forza 1.5 with PC graphics and a Zynga business model...","reviewText":"If this is the future of gaiming, we're all in big, big trouble...First of all, we all need to know that Turn 10 was rather &#34;rushed&#34; by Microsoft to get this title ready for release day.  It wasn't quite time for a new Forza title, with Forza 4 not yet reaching it's two-year-anniversary.  (That's been the Turn 10 business model - make the games last for two years.)  Microsoft needed a big title for release day, and Turn 10 skipped a few features to get a disc on the shelves in time.But was that the best idea...?What we're left with is an extremely watered-down version of a Forza title.  And trust me, I am rather disappointed.  See, with the popularity of &#34;Clubs&#34; in both Forza 4 and Forza Horizon, I took special efforts to get my Xbox One and Forza 5 LE copy pre-ordered.  It wasn't easy, at nearly $600 of &#34;stuff.&#34;  The frustration started when my new Xbox was dead-on-arrival, with a bad disc drive.  But with perseverance, I ran to a friend's house - who's new Xbox worked fine - loaded my profile up and went through the first tedious hours of gameplay where I was forced through a 5-race circuit before I could even see a menu.As soon as I could, I ran to the multiplayer screen to create my club - Old Man Racing - which still today is at-capacity in Forza 4...  But I couldn't FIND the club menu...  because there ISN'T one.  And that's when I took to the internet to realize what all was missing - like 200 cars, and over a dozen tracks - GONE from previous titles.  Then there's the freeplay mode which only allows a smattering of cars to choose from.  Plus, racing with a &#34;rented&#34; car rewards the driver with nothing - no cash, no experience points - nothing.  There's also no ability to sell your created liveries, or auction off cars, or do anything online except race other players.  The absolutely monumental marketplace experience that Turn 10 created in Forza 4 is GONE.Here's what Forza 5 gives us over Forza 4.  Breathtaking graphics.  Microtransactions.Yeah - microtransactions.  I'm not going to go into detail here because enough have already complained of it, and their complaints are completely valid.  The first it came to my attention was the little text on the screen that said, &#34;Press Y to Boost Experience!&#34; and so I did, only to be confronted with a screen where I could spend real money to earn experience faster.  What a terrible, terrible game mechanic.  I mean, what are we teaching people?  That money gets you places?  Whatever happened to working hard for the things you want to achieve?  And why - after shelling out $80 for a freakin' disc, do they STILL think I'd be willing to shell out more cash?Forza 5 simply isn't worth it.  The experience points and cash and all the other nonsense isn't worth this basic racing simulator.  There's nothing here demanding my attention - no reward for grinding through the muck that is this shell of a former title.  After roughly 6 hours of playing I have all three Vipers, and frankly that's all I ever want in a racing game anyways!Turn 10, shame on you.  I've been a dedicated fan of your titles since 2007.  I think I'm going to see what Gran Turismo has to offer this time...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options.

The one thing that will stand out is the amazing graphics of the game especially the characters throughout the levels as they seem as lifelike as possible,  here's one point as your defending your position in one level at a burger joint you see your Sergent barking out orders but if you do a closeup the face looks amazingly lifelike as the character gives out his commands going so far as an almost perfect lips-synch as you hear the voice actor doing the role.  The map system is a little problematic at times nothing major nut when your in a firefight you can sometimes feel like you getting turned around trying to get to your position or rendezvous point.  The games give you the option of single player, co-op or multi-player whichever you prefer.  Some people might get disturbed on one level that generated a lot of controversial when the game first came out and that was of course the airport level,  all I can say is if you don't like playing the bad guy even for a little bit that has you doing a very horrific assignment as you work undercover then this game might not be for you.  The controversial levels is actually pretty short but you can't continue on the storymode play until you finish it so again I say check out the level either online or at youtube just to see if it won't bother you so much.  The voice cast for the game is top notch as you hear some memorable actors in the game at least for me like Keith David(Platoon) and Lance Henriksen(Aliens) who do a superb job in their roles.

{"product_name":"B0050SYYEK","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Microsoft and Harmonix Have Done It Again","reviewText":"Dance Central was a huge step forward in dance video games when it was released as a launch title for the Xbox Kinect. It wasn't the first video game to let you use \"real dance steps\" (Just Dance had pioneered the concept a year earlier on the Wii). But by making use of the Kinect, it offered unprecedented accuracy in evaluating your precise moves. The question is, does Dance Central 2 move the platform forward? The answer is a resounding \"yes\".As soon as I started up the game, one thing I noticed right away was that my whole body was getting picked up by the Kinect sensor, even though my TV is only about 6 feet from me. I can't tell you how many Kinect games can only detect my torso and above.Something else I noticed right off the bat was that the user interface that Harmonix developed was the best I've seen of any Kinect game. You can scroll through long song lists easily, and menu selections require simple and foolproof \"swipes\" of the hand. Microsoft should require every game developer to use this instead of the current situation where each invents their own.Okay, on to the game play itself.There are five menu options when you start Dance Central. They are:DanceCrew ChallengeFitnessOptionsBuy New DancesAs with the previous version of Dance Central, you can just jump right into dancing by selecting \"Dance\". You'll be shown a list of songs to choose from. I noticed that as of today the Amazon product page doesn't have the list of songs, so I'll provide it here (the complexity of the song is in parentheses):Atlantic Connection and Armanni Reign - Reach (1)B.o.B ft. Bruno Mars - Nothin' on You (3)Bananarama - Venus (2)Bobby Brown - My Prerogative (4)Britney Spears - Toxic (7)Bruno Mars - Grenade (4)Chingy - Right Thurr (3)Ciara ft. Petey Pablo - Goodies (4)Daddy Yankee ft. Fergie - Impacto - Remix (2)Daft Punk - Technologic (6)Darude - Sandstorm (1)David Guetta ft. Akon - Sexy Chick (7)Diddy ft. Keyshia Cole - Last Night (2)Digital Underground - The Humpty Dance (2)Donna Summer - Hot Stuff (3)Electric Valentine - Body to Body (3)Enrique Iglesias ft. Pitbull - I Like It (3)EXILE - I Wish for You (4)Far East Movement ft. Cataracs and Dev - Like a G6 (5)Flo Rida ft. David Guetta - Club Can't Handle Me (3)Gnarls Barkley - Run - I'm a Natural Disaster (6)Haddaway - What Is Love (5)Justin Bieber - Somebody to Love (6)Kevin Lyttle - Turn Me On (2)Kurtis Blow - The Breaks (2)La Roux - Bulletproof (2)Lady Gaga - Bad Romance (5)Lady Gaga - Born This Way (5)Lena - Satellite (7)Little Boots - Meddle (4)Mary J. Blige - Real Love (1)Missy Elliot - Get Ur Freak On (7)Montell Jordan - This Is How We Do It (2)New Boyz - You're a Jerk (3)Nicki Minaj ft. Sean Garrett - Massive Attack (4)O-Zone - Mai Ai Hee - Dragostea Din Tei (1)Remy Ma - Conceited There's Something About Remy (5)Rihanna - Rude Boy (3)Sean Kingston - Fire Burning (3)Sir Mix-a-Lot - Baby Got Back - Mix Mix (6)Tweet ft. Missy Elliot - Oops - Oh My (3)Usher ft. Lil' Jon & Ludacris - Yeah! (5)Usher ft. Pitbull - DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love (5)Willow Smith - Whip My Hair (5)For each song, each player can select a difficulty of Easy, Medium, or Hard. The \"complexity of the song\" plus \"difficulty level\" together dictate how complex and intricate the choreography is.As others have noted, new to Dance Central 2 is the ability for two dancers to dance at once head-to-head. Once you select a song, the screen basically splits into two sides, where both dancers select the difficulty level they want to dance to (this allows for a \"golf-like handicap\" where strong dancers and weaker dancers can compete head-to-head). Here's where you really do need at least 8-10 feet of space and to stand separately, or you'll be bumping into each other and confusing the system if your motions cross.I was a little perplexed as to why the system automatically assumed that two players; I would have rather seen the split screen come up only when another person stepped into the camera. Still, if you're playing solo, you can just ignore the left side of the screen and select \"Play Solo\".The first time you play, you start out by reviewing the basics. For those who don't know, the concept is simple: you try to mirror the movements of an on-screen dancer as if you're looking through a mirror. A series of unique flashcards, with real dance move names like \"cabbage patch\", \"snake\", and \"shoulder pop\", will tell you which moves you should be performing as well as which ones are coming up. You have a couple cues to tell you how well you're dancing--a \"spotlight\" under your feet will display encouraging words when you hit the moves, the onscreen dancers will glow red if you're out of place, a boombox will display 1-5 stars depending on your progress through the song. Gold flashcards are worth 4x the points, and if you nail multiple moves at once, you'll \"pump up the room\".Most of the reviewers have already talked about how spot-on the motion detection is, and all I can say is I agree. Every motion of your arms, legs, and body seem to be tracked almost perfectly. There are certain types of actions that the Kinect isn't necessarily great for (gunfire, precision sword fighting, and auto racing come to mind), but it's games like this where the Kinect's capabilities really shine.After the song is done, you can view Photos of your performance. A nice new touch is that there is also a \"Break Down\" section, where the system will identify which areas of the song you didn't perform very well in, and review which areas you need to practice.\"Crew Challenge\" is another new feature of the game. This is a 2-player \"story\" mode where both players perform as a \"Dance Crew\" battling to get to the top. Scoring works the same as in Dance mode with a few differences. For example, during dance battles, each member of the crew will be able to \"go solo\" where good performances will result in double the points. During a \"Free 4 All\", the dancers have to perform any of the moves of the song to score points. And so on. I was a little disappointed that the mode required two players, as this leaves out a large percentage of people. Having said that, if you've got a dancing buddy, you're going to love it.To play \"Fitness\" mode you need to sign into a gamer profile. There's no option on the main menu to do this, you need to go to the Kinect menu and do it. Once you're signed in, you're brought to a menu where you can \"Enable Fitness Mode\". Once you've done this, the game will begin to track the calories you burn and the length of time you've played the game, both per session and lifetime. There are also a couple suggested workouts song mixes you can choose from, with names ranging from \"Easy Start\" (a 20-minute workout consisting of lighter songs such as Last Night and Hot Stuff) to \"Sprint\" (a 10-minute workout consisting of intense songs such as \"Run (I'm a Natural Disaster\" and \"Toxic\") and  \"The Long Haul\" (a 49 minute marathon consisting of just about everything). I would have liked some more features within Fitness mode, such as the ability to set goals, set a schedule, see graphs of your progress, and so on. But regardless of all that, Dance Central 2 does have the potential of being a great way to work out that surpasses any step aerobics class at the gym.In the \"Options\" menu, you can turn on and off Photos, Freestyling, Autosave, and Voice Control. There's also an intruguing option called \"Enter Cheats\".\"Buy New Dances\" leads you to the downloadable content store. As of this writing there are 32 additional songs, each costing 240 Microsoft Points (about $3 a song). You can also purchase Dance Packs for 480-960 Microsoft Points each, and Marathon Packs for 1400 Microsoft Points. There's a pretty good variety of artists to choose from, from Ne-Yo to Rihanna to James Brown to The Black Eyed Peas to Sean Paul.Bottom line, Dance Central 2 is a great sequel to an already great game. Of course, there is going to be a debate over whether Dance Central 2 or Just Dance 3 is the \"better game\", and I'm sure opposing sides will defend their choice with religious ferocity. But from my point of view, they're very different games. Just Dance seems to put more of an emphasis on being party game that's just \"fun\" (with more frivolous and lighthearted choreography and multi-platform play, but perhaps at the expense of precise motion tracking), while Dance Central definitely puts a higher emphasis on technical accuracy and perfecting the dance steps. But at the end of the day, both are extremely enjoyable to play, and both can provide a great workout.But when all is said and done, from a motion detection perspective and a game which can teach you real dance moves that you can take onto any dance floor, Dance Central 2 right now represents the pinnacle of \"real dance move-based\" dance games on any platform.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"More Star Wars than Star Wars","reviewText":"It sounds funny, but it's true. As I remarked to a friend when I first played this game, \"You don't play Star Wars, you LIVE it.\" In this game you really feel like you are part of the Star Wars universe. Truly, all of the things that people most loved about the original trilogy is here. There are aliens and bounty hunters eager to pick a fight, defenseless people in need of a rescuer, a Han-Soloish soldier, a Leihish Jedi (who sure acts like she's a princess), Sith Lords (including one who talks through a mask), a smuggler ship (probably the fastest in the galaxy), an old hermit jedi, a wookie companion, and a plot-twist to die for.Boatloads has been said already, but it bears repeating: The combat system is awesome, as is the inventory management system. The voice-acting is FANTASTIC, and there's loads of it. The graphics are sweet (except for the jaggies and low-res full-motion video), the music is PERFECT, and the branching choices in conversations make it like watching a new movie where YOU are the star almost every time. Truly, the amount of choices you have in this game is staggering. Even if you only play this game in the four most basic ways (light-side male, dark-side male, light-side female, dark-side female), there are four different storylines! When you take into consideration all the different choices that you can make, and the fact that this game takes about 30 hours to beat the first time, you can see how so many people fell in love...Much has been said in the past about the short-comings of rpgs, about how you always have to do things in a present order, and things don't change even if you change responses in conversations and whatnot. Well, this rpg changes all that in a major way. After about the first ten hours of gameplay you will leave the first planet, and then you are free to complete the rest of the planet in your quest in any order you wish! You can even leave a planet and come back multiple times!One of the coolest things about this game is how you come to feel like you are a part of a living, beathing Star Wars universe. The people you take with you will talk to each other, and to people you meet along the way. People will treat you differently depending on how you dress and what your status is. And things in this game MOVE (as in ships taking off at starports and vehicles flying by).Oh, and how ABOUT that light-side/dark-side thing? Every choice you make effects you either in a good way or in an evil way, making either your light-side, or dark side powers stronger. This just might be the first rpg where morality played such a huge role in the game. I also appreicate how many, many situtations in the game have more than one solution. Ever played a game where if you didn't do EXACTLY the right thing in a situation you died? Well we'll have no more of that! In this game you can hack computer systems, repair battle droids, or just plain go in guns ablazing! The choice is up to you...Lastly, I must say that what really sent this game into the stratosphere for me was the INCREDIBLE character of Bastilla. Featuring incredible voice acting by Jennifer Hale, Bastilla is easily one of the most memorable characters in all the Star Wars universe (one conversation my character had with her was almost WORD FOR WORD the same as one I once had with my own sister...talk about frighteningly good script-writing!).I could go on and on about the references in the game to Star Wars expanded universe, or how great the light-saber fights are, or about how cool it is to customize your character to be either strong with the force or strong with a light-saber, or about the psycho-asssasin droid the mandalorian, and how about that twilik teenager =)... or my favorite moment of all, the first time I used a jedi mind trick!Suffice it to say that if you love RPGs, sci-fi, good games in general, and in particular STAR WARS, you must buy this game NOW!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"Final Fantasy X -- It Is Not","reviewText":"I REALLY wanted this game to be good. I really really did. I have had it on pre-order since June, and had it in my hands the day it was released.Sadly ... I didn't consider it to turn out as wanted.It is my understanding (and I could be wrong about this, I don't follow gaming news religiously) that while it was under development it was being called the \"real\" Lord of the Rings RPG that would take away the bad taste in our collective mouths that wasThe Lord of the Rings The Third Age.  Sadly, the War in the North turned out to be, if anything, worse than Third Age.  The only Lord of the Rings game worse than War in the North that I have played so far, has beenLord of the Rings: Conquest, and that one was such an on-rails buggy mess, than even my group of friends who will play almost anything war/shooter/fighting related shunned it.As I understand it, War in the North started out as \"The Lord of the Rings: The White Council\" which was canceled by EA. Conquest is what came out of the work done on that canceled game, instead. But the idea for an open-world, free form RPG (like FFX) was then morphed into War in the North. Sadly, as I said earlier, that idea did not pan out.First of all, the game is short. And I mean SHORT. For an RPG, that is my #1 deal breaker. I want to spend time in the world and developing the story and the characters if I am going to play an RPG. I finished War in the North in 10 hours, without even meaning to. As I entered the section where the main enemy was supposed to be, I was thinking \"well, surely he is going to get away, and we will need to keep chasing him -- it is too early for this to be the end game, I have just BARELY begun to reach the 3rd tier in my skill tree with my character.\"  Turns out -- nope, that was it. I even had some unfinished side-quests not completed yet, because I figured I would hit them after I pushed the story forward a little more.Second, your characters are forgettable at best. Shallow doesn't begin to describe this game. I can tell that about 80% of the budget and time was spent on the combat engine and environment graphics (which are beautiful, by the way), and about 10% on writing, and about 10% on voice acting and dialog. It shows. I could barely remember my main character's name, let alone her companions. We never get any character development, or extended cut scenes showing us how, or why things are happening. They just do. In the end, I didn't care any more for my character than I did when I had started. How could I? I didn't know much about her, and I had only spent about 10 hours with her.Third, the rest of the game is EXTREMELY shallow. The crafting system might as well not be there, the skill trees are extremely short and you CANNOT get through even a main tier by end-game completely, unless you forgo another tier entirely. Additionally, your class skills turn out to sometimes be required for quests-- but the game doesn't TELL you that. The only hint you get is a summary after you complete a zone saying you missed some secrets. The ranger's power shows where some out of the way chests are, that is easy enough to find with the lore-master if one searches carefully enough. But the dwarf's power is to find hidden rooms in caves, and it turns out you NEED that power in one section of the game, in order to complete a quest. Everything feels shallows and rushed, except for the combat.Fourth, the game is silly and barely believable. The giant eagles TALK in the game, and are MAJOR story-line characters involved with heavy dialog. It just doesn't get much more ridiculous than having a \"we need to save the world\" conversation with a giant bird, speaking in a British accent, with nobody batting an eyelash. Additionally, things like random elves in the middle of the forest being held captive by orcs, and completely nonchalant about it all, and all of the characters \"oh well\" responses to ALL dialog options, and deaths of characters, etc. makes the game entirely unbelievable.Fifth, the game uses a checkpoint save system. In this day and age, that is unforgivable.Sixth, you have 2 companions who play with you and back you up. They are meant for multi-player, but they will be computer controlled if nobody is playing with you. What I didn't realize, and the game doesn't explain, is that when nobody is controlling them, your AI controlled companions manage their levels on their own, and they will outfit themselves with better gear as they find it, etc. You CANNOT (like in other RPGs) toggle to view their character sheet, and arrange their gear and leveling choices, like you do for the character you are currently playing. You *can* give them weapons or armor, and they will equip it if they can, but they will ignore what you gave them in favor of the next slightly better damage weapon that comes their way, or slightly better armor rating piece of armor -- even if what you gave them had better overall stats.  The final aspect of confusion for your AI controlled companions is that if you switch to control one of them (which involves exiting out of the game at a save point, changing characters, then loading back in -- or choosing to character swap at a chapter break point) you can choose their XP expenditures, and their armor and weapon load-outs -- but as soon as you switch away from them again, all of YOUR choices are swapped out for the choices the AI was making up until you took control.  That was confusing, and also extremely frustrating.Finally, the graphic engine for the environment is better than for the characters and enemies. You can tell how long this game was in development, because the graphics for the characters, especially, look like plastic models from PS2 era games.This game is a hack & slash RPG-light game, in the spirit of other SnowBlind games like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance & Champions of Norrath. The only thing that really changed was the setting. If that kind of game is your cup of tea, you will love this game (and you should add a star to my review in your head). If not, you will feel like I did. It is a decent weekend occupation, but at the end of it, you won't care about the characters any more, and you will barely know what was really going on. The game spends way more time getting you into combat, rather than explaining why you are in combat, and what it is accomplishing.3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Bryan \"BMG\"","summary":"COD online servers too risky to play on, and graphics look like play-station 1's","reviewText":"Usually COD first player is lame, but I can't talk about that since I didn't play that much of it. I bought the game only to play online in multiplayer mode, such as the death-matches. First off the game is sort lame on its own. It's too fast, you spawn and die quickly. You barely know who even shot you, except for the \"kill cam.\" There are no places to hide or take cover, you just get shot at any angel. And it encourages people to shoot through walls even; it's one of their challenges.There are not that many maps to play on. It's dumb that there aren't any maps where you can be Americans vs. Nazis. All of them are either USA vs. Japan, or USSR vs. Nazis. Its graphics are like 2d objects in a 3d map. Everything looks like a picture to me, instead of furniture or whatever. The resolution is awful, it's all blurry.  I can hardly tell if a bookshelf is made out of wood on these maps; it's just 3 colors of brown slushed together.  Sometimes I found myself playing only to watch my rank go up, but that got messed up anyways.The main reason nobody should buy this game is that it is full of people that are playing a modified version of it or people who hack into cheats already in the game. First of all, this ruins the game, playing with cheaters. And second some of these modders ruin your game. I got cyber attacked while playing the Nazi Zombies mini game that you can buy extra. The person ruined my rank, made it rank 1 when it was 20, and made my XP negative. Now I can't play any of the Xbox live options on this game, because it says unlock at level 1, and I guess I'm a neg level. And the customer service for the game won't talk to you about these kinds of things so they won't help you. If fact, I haven't gotten any response from them at all. So COD sucks, it has too risky of servers. And now I'm boycotting all their crappy games. (Xbox 360)Update:customer service knows about the mod problem, but the company still wont fix it because they are stupid.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Bickham \"Dillannj\"","summary":"After 400 hours of gameplay...","reviewText":"This game is more about an Auction House than playing a game. Loot is rare, I mean scarcely rare, and so randomized you could play, like me, hundreds of hours and get nothing good for your character. BUT, you can take all your gold and try to find an over priced upgrade on the Auction House, a place where you will compete with hundreds of auction house farmers that sit lurking for reasonably listed items they can buy instantly to relist for a 100x markup... Oh, you could do this too of course, if you don't mind drudging through a spreadsheet seeking items to buy and resell... Sound like fun? Of course, while doing this you won't actually be playing the game... or leveling your character... or progressing. If you buy D3 know you will be buying a 60 dollar auction house run by a bunch of mean spirited monsters preventing you from affording even a single upgrade... They even have a nickname for their little style of play, Diablo Tycoon.However, the first play through is good. You might buy it and, like me, think it's a great game. Play 400 hours and see if you feel the same way!I heard someone call this game PvAH, that's, Player vs. Auction House, and let me tell you, that's all this game is, A giant Auction House. And as a player you will be forced to use the auction house if you want to progress, because loot you can use is about as common as finding hundred dollar bills laying on the ground.Lastly, the game shipped with exploits and dupes and gosh knows how many economy breaking bugs... The company is more focused on nerfing characters abilities and spots in the game that are player friendly than doing anything for characters who are struggling... Because, you see, in their opinion, you can just use the auction house and be well geared, if you just have a good 100 million gold... in 400 hours of playing across multiple 60's I have made a grand total of 20m gold... that's not even enough to buy an upgrade on the Auction House anymore, lol.If you buy, it's your dime, but don't say you weren't warned.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"Be the Bat in all of his Dark Glory","reviewText":"This game is actually, for all intents and purposes, quite good.  Especially if you're a Batman fan, which I assume you are or else why would you bother buying this...unless it was FOR a Batman fan, which is very nice of you by the way?  But truly, the game is definitely high on the charts for games.  The gameplay is a seamlessly continuous line between stealth and action which, in a word, defines Batman.  As the big, bad, Bat you can effortlessly remain hidden and then spring into an excellent action sequence wherein you take down the bad guys with moves that will get anyone jazzed up.  The cinematic quality of the game during these sequences, alone, is something to die for, let alone throughout the rest of the game.This lovely start to the Batman Arkham series provides realistic atmospheres and a playable map that is extensive, challenging, and altogether fun.  But I cannot look past some of the nuances that drove me up the wall.  Now, granted, keep in mind, the game is actually amazing, and these are minor complaints.  As with most reviews, if there's something big to whine about, it overcomes the small things, if the game is superb the smaller complaints arise.Detective Mode, for me, kills it.  Detective mode is when you can use Batman's technology to analyze the environment at any time, allowing Batman to see through walls, see if enemies are up ahead and if they are armed, and whether or not there's an interactive environmental area you can destroy in order to get a Riddler trophy or find a way around or above the bad guys.  Sounds great, right?  Well, then why would you ever turn it off?  When I started to flow in and out of the mode I realized just how beautifully rendered the environments are and how much amazing detail was delivered to the game.  You don't see any of that in Detective mode.The boss fights are redundantly annoying after a while.  I was more excited for rooms where seven bad guys with guns awaited my stealthy take-down skills than the bosses which were, basically, just steroid powered baddies.  There was, thankfully, some change here and there (Scarecrow and Killer Croc, for instance), but it wasn't enough to get me as excited as just going through the game stringing up Blackgate and Arkham prisoners.It's also very difficult to tell where you're going or if someone is ahead/below you since the Bat takes up nearly a half of your screen at all times, sometimes more if you happen to like gliding down from high places.  And who doesn't?! Your best bet is to run everywhere, which places the camera directly behind Batman instead of off to the side.  And that's annoying in of itself since you have to hold down, in this case since it's PS3, the X button while pushing the analog stick forward.  Now, I could be wrong, but I thought that we could turn analog sticks into pressure sensitive walk/run systems.  Half way pushed forward, walk, all the way, run.  It's not difficult.I know this review seems rather negative, but when you break it down I'm just aggravated by too much Bat Butt in my screen, repetitiveness, and the fact that I think a sleight was performed to the developers of the game who struggled for a good portion of their lives to bring to you an environment that's stunning beyond words, but overtaken by a radioactive colored Detective Mode.  Whereas the gameplay, story, writing, interactions, style, atmosphere, and juggernaut cinematics trump indefinitely.  If you haven't played this game, you should, and if you have I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"This is absolutely the best game (will be best series) ever","reviewText":"This game should be put in a museum because it is, in every sense of the word, art.  It has a story which rivals any movie I have EVER watched.  It has a system which takes the best elements from the Final Fantasy series, adds some new ideas, and combines them in a way that will keep you playing after you watch the ending.  These are only a few of the things that make this game great.This game begins in modern times with the discovery of a mysterious artifact, the Zohar, which will be one of the main objects that the entire series focuses upon.  The scene quickly changes to about the middle of the fifth millennium (although the game says 4000 years later, it appears to take place in 4500 or so).  The main character, Shion Uzuki, is working on creating the robot KOS-MOS on board the Galactic Federation's starship, the Woglinde.  From there, the two heroines join up with four other friends, all of them coincidently attempting to reach the planet of Second Miltia (which is reached within the game... during the ending movie).  Thus begins Xenosaga's epic story line.This game explores many, many themes, such as the humanity of something who isn't human, and uses many religious messages, both vague and not so vague, to enrich the plot.  Through LONG cut scenes, many of which are 20-30 minutes long, alliances are revealed, both between heroes and villains, and great space battles are waged.  If you don't care about a game's story, you can skip all the cut scenes, cutting at least five hours out of the game and removing most of the game's dialog.  I suppose if you are skipping it, you don't really care what's going on, but if you do, you will not see much of ANY story in the game.  Sitting through the cut scenes is never annoying, and often will make you forget that you are playing a game.  The story alone is good enough to convince you that you are playing a movie.I wasn't expecting much from the music.  Although produced by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (I don't have the box in front of me, so spelling and name may be off), some of the music is highly repetitive and not as exciting as what Final Fantasy fans are used to.  Some of the songs, however, are quite well done, and add a great deal to the game.For those of you still reading, the battles can and will often last five to ten minutes (yes, non-boss battles), and will challenge even people who have played many RPGs.  Although most battles are avoidable, you will want to level up your characters often for the later battles.  There are two main types of attacks: ether (magical) and physical, and within those more types, such as elemental type, distance, and hit type.  Certain attacks are better against some enemies, so if you have the wrong characters for a situation... too bad.  You can't switch characters during battle, so have fun.What else can I say.  This game tops Kingdom Hearts, which I previously called the best game ever.  It's also on the greatest hits collection, so if you like RPGs, it's a good deal for a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2003"}

It is, of course, still a military shooter, but the focus in this series has always been on realism.  The story is somewhat strange, and seems to exist in an almost Tom Clancy-like universe that flips back and forth between different characters and their missions.  I found the combat to be fun (mostly) and the map is big enough that you can choose different routes to get to your objectives, but the game uses checkpoints as a subtle way to force you into the \"best\" route and you can only cause certain events to happen on some missions by hitting certain checkpoints.Unfortunately, as enjoyable as Flashpoint is from time to time the A.I. nearly destroys the fun factor.  Your squad, to put it nicely, is inept in a lot of situations.  When I would tell them to wedge, they would have an odd habit of wedging perpendicular to me, with someone standing right in front of me, which caused the two idiots behind me to just sort of linger there.  Walking forward would fix this problem but then my squad would do it again, and this becomes annoying when you're trying to line up a shot to initiate contact, only to have the lingering fear that your buddy is going to shimmy right in front of your barrel as you pull the trigger.  The medic is also questionable, and many times I had to order him to treat a wounded soldier that he was literally inches from as the poor sap was bleeding to death.  This was often after all threats had been eliminated, and the medic would still just be in the prone staring at a tree or rock.  Come on, man.Also, ordering your soldiers to do anything other than \"halt\" is painful to watch.  When you tell them to clear a building they don't even bother stacking up on the door, usually two will go to one entrance and Dr. Einstein will head around back to go in the other entrance.  On multiple occasions I had all three killed by a single Chinese rifleman sitting in the middle of a room.  Having them clear two story buildings is even worse.  I once sent them to clear a two story building as we were securing a LZ to evacuate some hostages we had rescued.  I heard \"building clear\" and immediately got shot by a guy on the second story.  I hobbled into the building, had the medic patch me up, and headed upstairs alone to finish the job.  My squad relaxed on the first floor the entire time.Thankfully, the Chinese soldiers are just as stupid.  You will routinely see them low crawling across roads and flat areas of ground (in the middle of combat) that provide no cover or concealment, making them easy targets to pick off.  Flanking them is also easy and you will often kill entire squads this way, as they will all be looking in the direction they last saw you.Overall, this is a very niche title that will only appeal to a small audience.  If you're short on patience don't even bother.  The game was decent for the most part, but for the developers to focus on realism in terms of weaponry and equipment and completely ignore basic military tactics with the A.I. is unforgivable.  Bargain bin it if you're interested.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2012"}

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Loved It!!","reviewText":"After enjoying my XBOX for a long time now, I thought I would never get another gaming system....until Metroid Prime was released.  I have always been a Metroid fan since the old 8-Bit NES version.  I have had every metroid eventhough I never could really get into the first Metroid that was introduced to the gameBoy.  Anyway, the only reason I got the gamecube was to play this game, and I havent been dissapointed.  In fact metroid is still the only game I have for the GC.The first thing you will notice in this game is that the game has gone from a side scroller, to a 1st person 3d world in which your TV screen is Samus' visor.  That is the main thing you are going to have to get used to.  Because it is now a first person shooter, there are no more cool flips that Samus will do.  Other than that, I really like the switch.Graphics:  I was very surprised by this game's graphics on the GameCube, they are almost flawless.  Every detail was taken care of, look up into the rainy sky and you can actually see rain drops hit your visor (TV screen), come out of a deep river or lake, and you can see the water run off your visor.  All the boss enemies are original and not corny looking or cheap in their attacking methods (with the exception of one maybe), however some of them can still be difficult, but not frustratingly difficult.Sound:  The sound has been done very well in this game, but one thing I missed was the old background tunes from the NES version.  One tune did make its way over to the GC version, (duuuuu, daaaaaa dudududuuuuuuu, daaaaaaaaaa....etc), but other than that, the music is new.  The sound effects in this game have also been done very well, and again every detail seem to be taken care off.Gameplay:  The comntol in the game can be a bit cumbersome at first, mainly because of it being a 1st person game now.  You are no longer able to see every thing that is going on around you.  You can only see things happen directly infront of you and to your immediate left or right.  One thing that does help is the auto targeting feature.  This allows you to lock onto enemies and kill them without wasting precious time manually aiming your weapon.  As in all the other metroid games, you can find upgrades, bombs, super bombs, missles, energy tanks, different beams etc.  My favorite thing about these new upgrades are the different visors, for example, there is a thermal visor you can switch to which allows you to see enemies in a dark room.  One more thing I have to mention is that yes, Samus can still change into a ball.  When doing this, the screen actually zooms out so you can see the ball completely while she is rolling through tunnels and narrow passage ways.  Nintendo did a very good job on this.Overall:  I have been impressed with the game overall, the only reason I could give it five stars is because there are certain areas of your mission which can become very tedious and in some cases painfully boring.  However the rest of the game makes up for this few bad spots in the game.  I was very impressed that Nintendo had the insight that changing a side scroller to a 1st person shooter required more than just changing the view, they also changed the actual gameplay to play like a 1st person.  Eventhough you can't see behind you, the gameplay is designed in such a way that this will not cause much of a problem.I just recently purchased a new Sony 53 inch HDTV so I will be playing this game AGAIN from start to finish to get the full effect of this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HJG8","description":"","reviewerName":"BooBoo","summary":"Decent combat, wonderful visuals.... the rest...","reviewText":"Had some good hopes for this game, and at face value a few of them rang very true. The combat system is a great halfway point between your typical hotkey MMOs and an action game, it's fairly stationary, but it feels good and it works, everything flows well and feels polished and it's a very pretty game that always manages to run well without high end hardware.The problem? Well... The rest of the game sort of ... sucks.-The questing is bad by decade old standards, every class and every race has the exact same progression and the first ~30 levels are agony. It is a standard Korean hypergrind just to get to anything resembling good content.-There's no meat anywhere to be found in any subsystems or unique designs. If you're a person who likes to really tinker and really explore some good character building and other side elements, prepare for a wasteland because while the basic combat is cool in an MMO setting there's NOTHING to prop it up.-Class design is extremely vanilla. May as well just call it Nuker, Tanker, Healer. Next to no variety or creativity in skills or design, another thing that makes a giant dent in a good combat system-The interface is rather crap, filled with bloated baubles and arcane methods and descriptions (often wrong) and just outright missing core elements you likely saw back in the dark ages of the genre.-The narrative and characters are awkward and off putting. It's that special grade of Korean high fantasy where everything just comes across as creepy and everything makes a B-tier type presentation look legitimate.-It's also very.... fetishy. Prepare to enter a world with nothing but busty elves and lolita bunny girls but I won't hold that against it, I'm just too used to this stuff as an Asian RPG fan. If you want those unique values and settings you'll have to put up with the fact that these games cater to a lot of perverts.In the end the games biggest strike is simple: it shouldn't be an MMORPG. It should just be an Online RPG with focus on what it does well, without the tedious quest and large, empty landmasses. It doesnt have the content or the inspiration to support any of this stuff.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2012"}

I discovered it about 6 months later than the rest of the world, but I was hooked. The fast-paced co-op gameplay has provided me some of my favorite and most memorable multi-player moments. Left 4 Dead 2 is basically more of the same with incremental improvements, a few new features, and a generally improved experience. Since I never liked the competitive modes on the first L4D game and doubt that I'll play the competitive modes on L4D2, I'll keep my review focused on the single-player and co-op campaign modes.PROS:+++ Fast-paced gameplay+++ Intense and frantic battles that can feel overwhelming+++ Huge emphasis on co-op+++ Five campaigns+++ Dynamic enemy placement switches the action up so you get a slightly different experience each time you play the different campaigns.CONS:--- Computer controlled AI teammates are about as sharp as a bag of wet hammers.--- The XBox 360 offers only 4 types of control scheme, but none of them seem to offer me the flexibility I desire.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN L4D and L4D2:+++ Added new melee weapons+++ Added a new variety of weapons, including fun toys like grenade launchers.+++ Added several new special infected such as the Charger, Spitter, and Jockey+++ Common infected are much more colorful and diverse in design+++ Dismemberment and more detailed death animations result in more gore and chunks than the original game.+++ Improved sense of character development and story+++ Mission objectives have been more fleshed out, going beyond the first game's \"Get to the extraction point and wait\" concept.+++ Daytime levels--- Fewer lull moments. There is almost ALWAYS an attack imminent, which kind of kills the suspense.GAMEPLAY: The basic premise is that you play one of four different survivors attempting to fight their way to safety during the zombie apocalypse. Essentially you blast thousands of zombies into ever-loving bits as you fight and run for your life. The new game brings some new mission objectives, which adds a subtle but noticeable bit of depth to the game. Instead of waiting for a helicopter or boat to come pick you up after 5 or 6 intense minutes of fighting for your life, you might be expected to find a bunch of gas cans to fill up a car. No matter what you do, success will require teamwork.The new special infected are a nice addition to the mix. Jockeys that jump on you and ride you around, Chargers that pin you against walls or the ground and beat you to a bloody pulp, and Spitters that spray acid and explode into nasty bubbling pools of acid force you to adapt your strategies more quickly. Tanks and Witches are still tough, and the Smokers, Boomers, and Hunters are still around to make life hell as well. The common infected are more diverse and interesting. My favorite are the hazmat suit infected, which make a cool little depressurizing noise when killed which makes me smile every time.GRAPHICS: For the most part, the graphics are very similar but improved in many subtle ways. Shadows seem to be smoother and more accurate, levels have more color, and there is generally more detail to seen. Enemy death animations have been noticeably improved with more dismemberment and more detailed models. For example, shoot a zombie in the chest with a high powered rifle or magnum handgun and the creature will have a neat little hole you can look through. Subtle, but still noteworthy.PRESENTATION: With only a few (very minor) exceptions, I would argue the presentation for L4D2 is much improved over the original. The environments feel more diverse, taking you from bright and colorful New Orleans outdoor scenes to dank and ominous indoor settings. Many of the dark indoor settings are much more open, which is much spookier since your flashlight isn't as effective in large, open areas. The characters are far more interesting and have some interesting and humorous pre-scripted conversations. The redneck character, Ellis, is definitely my favorite since he says some really funny stuff followed closely by Coach. All in all, a step forward.SINGLE-PLAYER: Single-player mode is ok, but you'll be dealing with the game's biggest flaw: frustratingly stupid AI teammates. Do you feel like sniping zombies from a distance? Have fun with that because at least one of your teammates will invariably park themselves right in front of you so they can absorb your bullets. They heal you when you don't want healed and constantly give you pills, which suddenly means your gun isn't in your hands. They fall off ledges and have trouble keeping up in general, especially if you go up some stairs. Apparently they forgot that Rule #1 is Cardio. If I were stuck in a real zombie apocalypse and these were the only living people I ran across, I'd leave them for dead.CO-OP MULTI-PLAYER: As far as I'm concerned, cooperative multi-player is where it is at. I love it. Three or four players working together with good strategy can be a devastating zombie grinding machine. This is where the game truly shines and where I spend almost all of my time with the game.COMPETITIVE MULTI-PLAYER: I never really liked the competitive modes in the original and I really don't expect to spend any time playing them in L4D2. It isn't a judgment against the game itself, but more representative of the fact that I prefer co-op games so much more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

I have to say although I've been a Halo fan since day 1, I was very skeptical about this title after seeing the ODST nightmare that they released last year, but they've made up for it--mostly. So far....The GoodCo-op campaign--these guys started it all with that feature and stuck to it. Huge plus! Great campaign in addition to the co-op element. And when you modify your character out of the campaign, he or she shows up like that in the campaign. Nice touch. 9.5/10Firefight--DRASTICALLY improved. In ODST, firefight was garbage, plain and simple. Not enough ammo, underpowered weapons, the list goes on and on. But they completely improved on virtually every aspect of it. Massive customizability, options for everything, they fixed the terrible ammo system. I am dinging them just a little because they force you to go into matchmaking to earn any real money, which means playing with some of the worst people in the online community, as we all know. 9.0/10Weapon fixes--Personally, I hated the covenant weapons in all of the other games. I thought they were beyond lame. But they reworked most of them and now I actually enjoy using them. Nicely done.THE BADA couple of minor complaints. There really are some things they could have improved on for customizing armor. The undersuit is always the same color and can't be changed, nor can you color individual pieces of armor. Not a big deal, but just hoped for a little more polish. Same old limited color palette, which there really is no excuse for.The UglyTwo things that really bothered me about this game. The first is the campaign/firefight. When I played Halo 3 they had solved the provlem by getting rid of the Elites, but now they are back. Their movements are erratic and spastic, they hop all over and just look silly. I didn't realize until I was playing just how dated and played out some of the material had become. Half the time the Elites have their back to you but will react when you scope in on them. Time to hang up the covenant. If this franchise keeps going I really hope that they take it in a new direction. But the whole covenant thing is getting pretty tired.The really big complaint that I have is about the inability of the user to set up handicaps for INDIVIDUAL players in custom games. I know you can power up or power down entire teams or just the leader, etc, but that is not what we need. I have a lot of friends who like to play multiplayer but frankly they aren't very good. But they are my friends and I'd still like to be able to play with them. But they will not play Halo because there is no way to level the field unless you put all the bad players on one team and modify them all. What is really lame about this is that you COULD do all of those things in Halo 2, but they got rid of it and failed to bring it back in Reach as well. It seems that Bungie doesn't want to bring in new players, because their present course is alienating a LOT of gamers. Shame on Bungie for not adding this--and double shame on them for removing it in the first place. NEVER REMOVE FEATURES.A great game and I'm looking forward to finishing it up. For the reasons I mentioned, I'll probably go elsewhere for my versus gaming, but I can't be too sorry about that since Bungie doesn't seem too worried about it either!

However, Bungie generally does not make the same mistakes that Lucas did, for which we can be thankful. Although I felt it could have been a little better, the story for Reach is well developed and artfully told. The characters are rather static, but they have always tended to be in the Halo games. The gameplay is great, with enough similarities to the previous games to make it familiar to the gamer, but including enough new variations and tweaks to make it feel fresh. The graphics and musical score are both excellent.Where this game really really shines, however, is the multiplayer. Halo: Reach brings many new game types to the table, with tons of different versions within each type. Firefight has evolved from the fun past-time of ODST to a fully customizable onslaught of foes that will take a long time to get old. New variants like Invasion and Headhunter are very fresh and fun to play, and the additions of the different loadouts, although a bit different than what Halo players are used to, is to me at least a very excellent addition. All in all, this game is worth the money, and should have you playing it for a long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Very good even with it's drawbacks","reviewText":"Finally after what seems like an eternity the long awaited Final Fantasy 13 was in my hands...sadly it was over in a few short weeks, but while it lasted it was fun.I was put off my negative reviews before playing but I was always going to buy it, and it turned out to be a great experience. The usual stereotypes apply of course, as you watch a band of earnest fighters strive to change the world and stop an unstoppable power from destroying everything.Let's get down to basics: how does it feel to play? Well, the reviews are right in that for a lot of the time you simply run from point A to point B and fight monsters along the way. This seems like the formula for a VERY large portion of the game as a whole, and most of it under an atmosphere of urgency, I seem to remember every chapter seemed to be about some chase, or law and order disruption, or mass outbreak of violence, with very little lull in the action. Sounds great but the palette of an adventure needs light and shade...same problem as the film \"Advent Children\" had...after a while I was just mechanically bashing my way through enemy fodder without a clue as to what my goal was apart from winning each fight. And I have to say this is a drawback of the game in general. Right from the start I recalled a review that said \"play it for the story...play it for the story\". WHAT story? This was one simple dash through a precarious situation which basically involved being hunted by the authorities while simultaneously hoping to solve the mystery of what happens to people who get marked with a mysterious brand and either end up turning into crystal or becoming monsters. And here we get another problem...the plot hinges on you knowing understanding terms like l'Cie, fal'Cie, Pulse, Gran Pulse, Pulse l'Cie, C'ieth... the terminology is hideous! I was totally bewildered about 70% of the time which really didn't help me engage with the story.Anyway on to the important part, which is the battles: here the game redeems itself pretty well. You have a team of three active fighters (out of a total of six) and the battles are fairly dynamic, although they are very much turn based. A bit confusing, as in FF10, your characters zip around the battlefield but it's all just eye candy as when it's the enemies turn to hit, you will suffer damage regardless of whether they are on top of you or if you seem to be 100 meters away! Just to reiterate, you can't control characters movements, you just input commands, so all the lively leaping about on screen is automatic. Each character has an ATB and you can cue commands up and then when the ATB is full, the commands will be dished out. Now, you can only control one character at a time which I found a bit disappointing. I had come to this after playing Star Ocean The Last Hope, and that game has a great system of changing character control mid battle, which this would have benefitted from. As it stands, you only ever control the party leader and the other two are on auto pilot.The way the fighting is really controlled is the Paradigm Shift system, which I thought sounded like a chore before I started, but in fact it's THE most important part of fighting strategy. Basically, you have a bunch of skills (healer, magic attacks, physical attacks, guarding and so on), and you make sets of three (2 attackers and a healer, two healers and a guard, etc), and this is how you control the action. You have to prepare these outside of battle so that when fighting starts, you have a set of strategies ready. So the fight might start with one attacker, one healer and one status enhancer, and then, whenever you see an opening, you'll swap the strategy to all three attacking, swapping back to three guards when you see the enemy charging for a big attack. Now, controlling the paradigms is absolutely key to winning, and you have to be quick, as the battles in this game are fast. What's great is that the AI is perfect. Put your team on Attack/Heal/DeBuff and the other two team mates will do the right thing 100% of the time - they seem to know what will help you most or hinder the enemy most. They cure you of nasty afflictions straight away and go straight for the enemy weakness as soon as it is identified. You might think this is a bit simple but it's not, the fights are NOT easy! Well they start off fairly easy but towards the end they change quite steeply.There are a few great enhancements too: after every battle you are completely healed. This is a fantastic idea, as it means you don't limp crippled through long dungeons waiting for a healing spot or somewhere to buy items. Also, magic is unlimited in battle - again a great idea, as I used to hate using magic because it would run out - not any more! There are also precious few items in the battle menu - mainly just Potions and Phoenix Downs - no items that cause damage or status ailments, all this stuff comes from commands.As I said most of these seemingly simplifying enhancements are actually vital to the game as fighting is hard - buffing up and weakening the enemy is far more important that I used to think, I nearly always went into regular battle with a buffer and a de-buffer in my opening paradigm towards the end of the game. The bosses are good too, suitably impressive. However I'll add another negative here- the summons. They serve no purpose at all - I used them all once to see the cool animations, but never touched them after that.The game does finally go free-roaming in it's final stages, and it's one of the best parts of the whole experience, when the characters arrive at a large rural expanse, and it's HUGE! Suddenly you can go anywhere you want and the freedom is a breath of fresh air. The seemingly only side mission in the game now appears, where you can hunt for \"marks\", that is mini-bosses which can be incredibly tough. Even some of the random monsters in the open area are tough...I saw a big dog like thing soon after arriving and though, ah he looks tough, time for some power- levelling - well, he totally flattened me in seconds! Yes, the open area is full of enemies that you have no hope of beating on your first arrival, they are just there to be looked at and run past. Much, MUCH later I came back and pasted that big dog (it was a King Behemoth by the way) into oblivion where it belonged, but it took a long time to get to that stage.But even with this vast open area, the game still feels quite linear. The levelling up is disguised as a chart where you can allocate points to your chosen strengths on a big grid, but it's just one continuous path so you're only really advancing in one direction at all times. The weapon upgrade system is also very tiresome. All through the game you get various weapons and accessories - but I started upgrading mine straight away, thinking I would be able to trade up in some way later on...however every weapon you find starts out at level 1, which means that you can't discard your early efforts for something better - they ALL start off as weak as dishwater! I wasted a ton of synth materials on my very first weapons for all the characters and then had to start all over again when I got other types that I thought might be better...and the synth materials are scarce and expensive! I wish I had known this, but I resigned myself later on to the realisation that on a single playthrough you can really only pick ONE weapon per character if you want to upgrade it to any decent degree. Still, I ended up with some stuff that was not bad, but the synthesizing and upgrading system is not well explained at all.So I think I will summarize now:Graphics...amazing to look at, the cut scenes are especially good. Even the menus are stunning to look at.Music ...pretty good, although no set piece them tunes or songs (I can take or leave the Leona Lewis ballad).Acting...very good, although Vanille (the chirpy one) starts to grate occasionally.Story...hmm, it seems to me that very little happens. And this was really pushed in the previews for the game but I found it very weak, and mostly confusing.Battles...a big yes here, although is it just me or was the final boss fight a bit ordinary?Variety...nope there is not a lot of points for this. No towns or shops, only one side quest, no enhanced second game, very regimented character development. After-game activity is limited to an opportunity to carry on from the point just before the last boss and return to the main world to get even stronger...just to beat the optional mini-bosses, I guess.So I have to say I did really enjoy the game but in hours of devoted play, this was a short FF game for me. However I was please with the fact that I unlocked some really cool wallpapers by playing it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVNP8","description":"","reviewerName":"New Boy","summary":"Is there enough material to warrant a purchase?","reviewText":"The answer is YES! YES YES YES!I found Pokemon Black and White to be the first games in the Pokemon series that deeply disappointed me. I found the music to be, for the most part, boring and uninspired. They took away so many things that had come to make playing the Pokemon games so interesting and varied, such as the berry-growing and the Pokemon contests (which were replaced by musicals). And I disliked the direction they took with the story. I would have preferred if they actually just kept it as before, rather than introducing the idea that maybe having Pokemon battle each other wasn't ethical and then completely going with the argument that \"It helps Pokemon reach their true potential.\" As a 20-year old college student, it just seems a bit ridiculous, though I wonder if children blindly accept this explanation. Also, I felt that the games were lacking post-game content that was varied. The Battle Subway is a challenge, but after a while it gets boring as there is not much variety to it.Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, however, deliver where the first two games did not. First of all, the music in these two games is beautiful. There are many great new themes, especially in the new beginning cities and towns. The theme for Aspertia City (that's right, CITY - it has its own gym and Pokemon Center) is a breath of fresh air, and completely different from all starting themes before it. Quite honestly, it is one of the best in the series.Story wise, I feel that they toned it down with all of the ethical stuff and turned it more into a traditional hero-versus-Team Rocket story, which Game Freak has always done well.In terms of post-game content, this game has a lot to offer.First, there is the Pokemon World Tournament, where you can challenge past Gym Leaders and members of the Elite Four. You can also participate in competitions where you only battle in a certain style, such as double, rotation, and triple battles. I thought this was excellent since these modes are barely used in the storyline.There is also the White Treehollow and Black Tower, where you have to go to the lowest levels of these locations. The trick is, you don't get to bring items with you and the place is infested with Pokemon trainers with strong Pokemon. I have actually lost various times here. It is challenging, and I like it!In addition, there is also Join Avenue, a place where you can buy loads of new items, increase your Pokemon's friendliness, and even buy your Pokemon food that can raise their levels and their EV stats, which makes it easier to train Pokemon for competitive play.Also, there is now a medal system - basically, its a trophy system. It is pretty addictive. The game also gets a challenge mode! If you get the key yourself or have someone give you the challenge mode key, you can increase enemy levels and AI! Which is a big plus for me!A few other changes that I liked about Pokemon Black 2 and White 2:+When you run out of repels, a little text box pops up and asks you if you'd like to use another. It is faster than having to open your bag and pick it again.+You are no longer limited to Unova Region Pokemon.+It is easier to move Pokemon around in the PC. You can actually now choose whole groups of Pokemon to transfer at once.+Every gym has its own theme! This is excellent! I hope they keep doing this for all new Pokemon games, because it really helps give each gym its own feel.There are a ton of kool, new additions to the series this time around. So if you are wondering if you should get the sequels to Black and White, I say do it NOW!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow.

You don't get bored of the scenery because all the rooms are different; there's a bathroom, nursery, master bedroom, library, ballroom, basement, kitchen, backyard, etc. All of the ghosts are different, too. It's also the legendary King Boo's debut. I would recommend for all ages. The graphics are good and I haven't experienced any problems with the game. It's about time Luigi saves Mario. The game isn't one of those games where it's too hard and you get frustrated and toss it away and it isn't too easy either (beating it too quickly, then not wanting to play it over). It has great quality and it's not that short so it lasts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2009"}

I did NOT like the first Kingdom Hearts for the Playstation 2. While I loved the cut-scenes, the voice-acting, the graphics, the world, and the oh-so-awesome opening music, I found the tedious battles, frustrating platforming, horrendous level music, meandering story, and lack of any drama just killed the experience for me. Truth be told, I bought the game twice and sold it twice, and never did beat it (I got to Hollow Bastion and just couldn't take it anymore). I saw this game on sale for $10.00 and picked up a copy. It sat on my shelf for months until I decided to pick it up for a brief play. Oh....my....goodness!!!!!!This game is not only one of the best RPGs on the PS2, it is one of the best RPGs ever. Seriously. Right up there with Xenogears, Xenosaga, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, ect. The graphics in the first game were good. The graphics in this game are outstanding. The opening music in the first game was amazing. The music through almost this entire game is fantastic (there is some lame music from the first game, and the first world music is just passable). And while the first Kingdom Hearts was mostly just a tribute to all things Disney, this game is also a tribute to things Final Fantasy.The new plot for this game manages to take what was basically a gimmick in the first game (world-hopping to find your friends and a mysterious guy named Ansem whilst fighting the heart-devouring Heartless), and turns it into a bonifide epic as a mysterious organization,  armies of darkness, and classic Disney villains all clash to accomplish their own objectives. The plot of this game is amazing, absolutely fantastic. And all the new Square characters from the Organization manage to be both compelling and cool almost instantly, which each having signature weapons and personality that makes you immediately accept them as part of the story.The gameplay of the first game was a good idea, but EXTREMELY poorly executed, as you would basically fight hordes of identical or nearly-identical Heartless for hour, upon hour, upon hour, till you wanted to pull your hair out (try mashing the X button for 10 hours straight and falling over and over again on the platforming elements). In this game things are nicely mixed up by improving the overall flow of the fights, making your comrades more intelligent, and giving you lots of battle options (limit-breaks, summons, forms, and the awesome reaction commands). The reaction commands in particular make the combat much better. At times they are just quick-button-press-events ala God of War/Spiderman 3 where you press the triangle button at the right time to complete attacks. But later on they trigger combined attacks, other character's special attacks, and your own special attacks, giving a gee-whiz ultimate move feel to battles that would instead by infinite X button presses (at certain times these attacks will become Dynasty Warrior's style uber-moves that annihilate swarms of Heartless among a sea of enemies {unbelievable as that sounds, it's even better than you can imagine}.While most of the battles of this game are easy, some of the boses are actually quite difficult due to massive damage caused by their moves and the difficulty in executing needed attacks (but the game never cheats or feels cheap). One time I actually was KO'ed by one of the bosses from Organization XIII, but instead of starting the encounter from the beginning, I was immediately assisted by a hard-core Mickey Mouse who did massive damage to the enemy and then revived my entire party. At that point I realized that this was just just a good game, but a GREAT game.I cannot overemphasize how much this game is improved by dropping all the pointless back-tracking and bang-your-head-against-the-pavement platforming of the first game. Half of the time when you are told you need to go somewhere it immediately triggers a cut-scene where you are ALREADY THERE! If you tire of pointlessly wandering around dungeons in most RPGs you will find the incredibly elegant (yet simplified) interface and game design of this game a breath of fresh air. Very enjoyable.Again, the whole Disney universe feel of this game is used to great effect, and the unique attributes of each of the Disney movies are used to a much fuller extent. In the Little Mermaid World you will play a music mini-game, you'll fight Heartless on Light-Cycles in the TRON world, and you'll be thrust straight into the climax of Pirates of the Caribean, Mulan, and other favorites. Even the lame shooter from the first Kingdom Hearts gets a massive upgrade, becoming a part of the game you may actually enjoy thanks to its infusion of Panzer Dragoon-meets-F-Zero style. The interplay between the main characters is so good in this game that I actually realized I was growing to love Donald and Goofy in a way I hadn't felt since I was a kid (they are way more lovable in this game than the first). And then there are the stand-out moments like when you go into the past and Donald and Goofy look exactly like they did in the old black-and-white Disney cartoons. There are so many great moments in this game that there is bound to be SOMETHING that makes you grin like a pumpkin.The beginning of this game, the first couple of hours, is by far the weakest part of the game as far as compelling gameplay and wow moments, perhaps deceiving you into thinking the game will be boring and weak. But just wait. As soon as you go to the first world the game kicks into high gear. And all the strange confusing things that happen in the first few hours are important and contribute to one of the best stories I have ever seen in an RPG. No joke.If you liked the first Kingdom Hearts you will love this game. If you hated it you may still love this game, because it is absolutely amazing in every way that counts. Awesome story, awesome characters (Kairi is much more of a character you care about this time around, all the Square characters are great, and the dialog spoken by all the Disney classics is great stuff full of humor and drama), great graphics, outstanding muic, a fantastic battle system that never gets old, and plenty of the Disney charm that has kept fans loyal all these years. Oh, and Maleficent is the greatest villain in history. You can pick this game up for cheap, but even at full price it's worth every penny. A must-own for RPG lovers, and one of the greatest RPGs ever made without a doubt.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Lazy; Worst in the series.","reviewText":"I have been a huge fan of the God of War series since first being introduced when playing the GOD of war collection on the PS3.  Since then I have played GOWIII, Chains of Olympus, and Ghost of Sparta.  When God of War Acension was announced I was excited, but previous experience with hyped up video games that turned out to be disappointments did squelch my excitement a bit.As usual I passed on getting the game when it first came out because I think $60 is too much to pay for video games these days especially when chances are good they will last only a few hours, leave out critical pieces of the game (i.e. manual saves as in Bioshock Infinite), or overall be a disappointment.I have been price watching this game for many months and when a local B&M; store had this on sale for $19.99 I finally pounced.  Using my $10 Gift Card I only had to shell out 10 bucks for this game.Visually the game looks very good, pretty much on par as God of War III, but that is to be expected, so while there is nothing to complain about there is nothing really to rave about either.The storyline in this game follows Kratos shortly after he kills his family and his desire to break the oath he has with Ares.  That's pretty much to gist of the storyline and I won't get into it any further to avoid ruining it and also in fact that its quite hard to explain since there are so many flash backs.  The storyline seemed thrown together just for the sake of making another God of War game.With the mediocre storyline, the gameplay is even worse.  While this does feel like a God of War game, it just seems lazy and uninspired.  Kratos only has the Blades of Chaos in this game, which is understandable given the story, but the only upgrades you get are elements which all basically do the exact thing, and seem to cause the exact same damage.  The only noticeable difference between the elemental upgrades are the colors and the magic attacks, but like the other attacks, I don't see any advantage of using one element over another especially once they are fully upgraded.As another reviewer stated this game has some glaring differences between other God of War titles.  First if I remember correctly you could parry with one button in God of War III making it an invaluable tool in heavy combat.  However in Acension, parrying requires to to hold block, THEN press X.  This is not only cumbersome, it rarely works, and even when it does work, the parry attack often doesn't even connect making it a complete waste of time to even bother with.Difficulty is not on the level as God of War I, II, or even III, except there are places where the difficulty jumps up to an insane level.  Its not hard because the enemies are particularly hard, its because the game just bombards you with them, and being that none of your weapon upgrades do much damage and you don't have time to perform any of the combos.  Instead of trying to learn to effectively use the moves in the move list you are better off just button mashing to get to the next section to get past all the cheap enemies.  When button mashing doesn't work, then basically just either spam the same special attack over and over again, and/or hit and run.  During one of the final stages in this game, this is the only way to proceed because you have to beat hoards and hoards of the game's cheapest enemies without dying or having green chests to refill your energy bar.  If you happen die at any point during this section, then guess what you have to start all over from the beginning; gee what fun.Another omission is the lack of manual save points, however, unlike Bioshock Infinite that is not a big problem here because autosave points are close enough together that you rarely have to replay areas you have already completed.  Still I never understand why so many developers seem to be moving away from manual saves.  Is it because they think gamers like playing sections over and over again, or is it because they are simply getting lazy?Speaking of lazy, that is exactly how I would describe this game in one word.  It's an OK game, but compared to the other great God of War titles, this one is truly disappointing, and frankly seems nothing more than a money grab by Santa Monica Studios.  The length of the game is short as I expected; I beat it in 3 days, and was rewarded with an equally disappointing, but expected crappy ending.I sure hope this series doesn't go the way so many other franchises seem to be going; throw together a game, slap a hot franchise name on it and sell it for 60 bucks to as many people as possible.  I no longer fall for those tactics and I always wait until a game goes on sale at a deep discount before spending my hard earned money on it.I will mention that this game also has multiplayer, but I don't care about it, never cared about it, and never will care about it.  But the fact that Santa Monica Studios felt the need to add multiplayer and then seem to treat single player as an afterthought irritates me.  Not every single game needs to have multiplayer; there are still gamers that appreciate a good single player experience and would be more than happy to have a game with no multiplayer if it means a truly fun and epic single player experience which seems quite rare these days.Oh well I can't complain too much, after all I only paid $10 for it, but there is a disturbing trend I am seeing in video games these days.  These games have so much hype but very rarely these live up to it.  I remember a time when people had no problem paying full price for video games because they were almost assured it would be money well spent; sadly those days seem to be in the past.Recommended only if you absolutely love the God Of War series but only if you can get it on sale for less than the price as of today (8/6/2013).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}

I saw the reviews for this game, including criticism of the gameplay, story and a bizarre accusation that there were \"no new ideas\".  I waited for the price to drop to pick it up, and I'm really impressed.Yes, the criticisms of the story are valid.  It's pretty weak compared to the other games.  However, the gameplay and scale are excellent, as always.  Bosses and settings are enormous.  Production values are extremely high.The criticism that I have the most difficult time understanding is the \"no new ideas\" thing.  Various mechanics have been added to combat, and I felt more empowered than I ever have in the other games.  Try releasing the Hades elemental rage at the same time as unleashing your doppelganger to see some seriously cool stuff going on.  The heal/decay mechanic is also new.  The settings are imaginative and original.  It felt to me like a lot of new ideas are in the game, and it didn't feel at all like an expansion pack.I honestly liked this game better than God of War 3, and it's probably my second-favourite in the series, after the original.

Having a larger map readily available was nice, and I preferred to watch the cutscenes on the gamepad as well. Even if you're new to the series, there is still fun to be had here.

Back in 2004 is the first time I played a Metroid Prime game and that game was Metroid Prime 2 Echoes for the Gamecube which I did not like at all. Tha game was really slow paced, no voices which maes the game a little enclosed to be being realistic and the controls were horrendous: a normal first person shooter allows you aim and run at the same time but this game didn't and I found that extremely frustrating which is why I couldn't even finish 10% of the game. BUT Metroid Prime 3 fixes thos problems and makes it one of the greatest games for the Wii, maybe even  one of the greatest games of all time.The first thing I liked about MP3 than the previous 2 games were the controls, it takes a while at first to get the controls cuz there are a lot of buttons but once you get it down it almost becomes second nature. The second thing I liked was the inclusion of voice acting, it made the game feel more alive rather than just cutscenes with movement with barely emotion. The third and last thing is the fact that it was more straightforward, fans from the previous two may dislike that but in my opinion its better, it makes the game flow much better and smoother, theres not as much backtracking as there was in the previous 2.There are bad things about the game too. First is the lack of multiplayer, there was a multiplayer in MP2 Echoes but it was horrendous basically because of crappy controls, but sine the controls for MP3 is better, it would of been a nice inclusion to add multiplayer. The second is the loading times, the creators decided to disguise the loading times with cutscenes with Samus's ship which is good, BUT they also disguised the loading times with the doors that u are suppose to shoot in order to open, THIS WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, it takes almost literally 5 seconds maybe even 10 just for the doors to open and if you add that to the gameplay it rounds up to being 45 minutes wasted just waiting for doors to open and thats a lot of time., especially thos times when your in battle and trying to run and your still waiting for the door to open. There are few little things bad about this game and thats a very good thing.GRADING- Story - 3/5 (not that interesting but at least there's voice acting)- Graphics - 5/5 (amazing for at least Wii's standards)- Sound - 5/5 (the music is great and the sound of the creatures is great as well)- Gameplay - 5/5 (the wii controls is the thing that makes this game, the game wouldn't be 1/2 as fun without the new wii controls)- Longevity - 3/5 (after u beat the game, thats pretty much it)Overall a Great Game Period!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Fun and frustrating","reviewText":"First off, Uncharted 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games of all time.  It mixed all the elements of a good action/adventure and platforming title into one amazing ride.  Drake's Fortune, the game that started it all, has some fun moments, but expect to be frustrated much of the time as well.Graphically, the game probably had some of the best when it was released.  It's unfair to compare it to its successor (Uncharted 2) because, of course, the graphics in the latter are superior.  The consensus: Good for its time.  So let's move on, shall we?The voice acting is exactly what you can expect from any in the Uncharted series: It's amazing.  Drake is his sarcastic, clownish self and Nolan North does a perfect job portraying him.  Everyone is believable and that's what you should expect from a video game (Kratos, I love ya, but the shouting hurts ears after awhile-and I'd imagine your throat too).Gameplay: Aw, yes...  This is where I found it to be the most frustrating.  While elements are similar to Uncharted 2, they are far inferior when presented in Drake's Fortune.  First off, a big gripe I have is aiming.  If aiming a gun only puts it in the general vicinity where the person/mutant creature I'm trying to kill is located at, and not the actual creature (fortunately, in Uncharted 2, this was fixed...good job, developers!), how is that really called aiming?  I can't tell you how many times I (Drake) died because of the inability to successfully aim at someone/something to take it out.  Also, as many reviews have pointed out, the wave after wave of kill types (meaning you take out a group of guys, platform a bit, then repeat...and this happens throughout 3/4s of the game, people) is not only repetitive, but frustrating - I'd much rather have more platforming than killing enemy over and over in the same manner over and over (again, Uncharted 2 improved on this, rightfully so).  I also found the controls themselves to be wonky, at times even horrible, largely when I was told on a small indicator on the lower left of the screen to \"shake\" my control to get rid of a mutant enemy trying to bite into me.  Had I known this was what it meant before I died over and over, that would have been greatly appreciated.  Also, sorry for the spoilers, but you don't just fight evil men-you fight mutants.  Seriously.  And you don't know you have to until the first few times you get killed by them because, a, you have too little time to realize that these aren't people, they're mutant creatures that bite into you and, b, your aim controls don't really aim.  I digress, but can you tell how frustrated I am at this part?!  Why?  Because what would be an overall great title was ruined by some really bad, clunky controls.  As such, Uncharted 2 fixed them all, but that's why I recommend playing through this one first if you are new to the Uncharted series.  Overall, gameplay is decent, but lacking in many surprising ways that could've been fixed oh so easily.In the end, Uncharted-Drake's Fortune is an amazing action/action game with many pros, but it is the significance of what it lacks that drag it down so much because, after you play it, you'll soon realize how frustrating the detracting aspects of this title can be (I, for one, can say I was actually disturbed in Chapter 19 (the devil chapter)...for those of you who have played, you know what I mean).  It's a wildly fun, sometimes significant frustrating game that, despite its cons, is still one you ought to play.  Just be sure to buy another controller to replace the one you'll surely throw at the wall from time to time!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

If you've been playing on a SD set, try it on a HD set and the difference is pretty jarring. Uncharted is much like Tomb Raider's glory days, exploration, shooting, plus running and gunning. This is a really fun game and doesn't go pottymouthing up a storm either while the cutscenes play out like some games do.Now, the problems, the controls for shooting is pretty good, rolling around and still getting shot to death isn't so good, and finally melee mode is glorified but feel delayed. The throwing of grenades is annoying because it uses the SIXAXIS with no option to turn that off. The aiming of grenades isn't very good if you've got to tilt the controller and risk getting shot at. I'm not big on gimmicky use of motion controls but I know they had to squeeze it in somehow.There are some puzzles in this game, but not the same amount found in the older Tomb Raider games. There aren't secrets and hidden passageways to discover, the game only has a few unlockables such as character costumes. Not a dealbreaker for such a nice looking and fun game, but this is game is nothing you haven't played before. Unless you want to find every single treasure in the game, this one doesn't have much replay value and the ending fell a bit short of expectations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

You work alone during your missions with the support of a remote team who periodically feed you info and guidance throughout the missions.  If you are caught by the enemy, your country will deny your existence and any connection to you.

Light and shadows are the key elements in the game and play a vital role to your success.  Unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing, in Splinter Cell you must be tactical in your approaches and slip by your enemies as if you were never there - creeping around in the shadows is the best approach.  However, sometimes you will be seen and have no choice but to eliminate any witnesses.  After doing so you should then elect to hide the bodies in the shadows as not to alert anyone of your presence. Causing a panic can easily create a real mess that will sound alarms and quickly end your mission - in a bad way.  This play with light and dark is very well executed and amplifies the immersive qualities of the game.Even now, years after its' initial release, Splinter Cell is still worth picking up and playing.  In fact, I originally purchased Splinter Cell for the Game Cube to take advantage of the exclusive connectivity features which enable the player to use sticky cams and have a tactical map displayed on their GBA, which is very neat by the way.  Only after playing the two following Splinter Cell games (Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory) on Xbox did I then decide to buy the Xbox version of the original Splinter Cell.  I played through all of the missions again, this time including the exclusive downloadable maps from Xbox LIVE, and found it to be even more enjoyable than the fist time around.

{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason the rational Sony fan \"Dark Overlord of...","summary":"Nice system, but don't get the 3G version","reviewText":"I want to start by noting that the Vita is a nice piece of hardware but the 3G just isn't worth it in my opinion. The Vita has the best build quality I have ever seen in a handheld. The screen is pretty sexy and multi-touch is nice. If you use the web browser you can touch two fingers to the screen and move them apart and that will zoom in the screen. Move your fingers toward each other and you will zoom out. Very comfortable to hold. The PSP always felt as if it wasn't quite \"tall\" enough for my hands. The Vita fits comfortably and your fingers will naturally want to rest against the rear touchpad.Messaging people on their PS3s. I was easily able to send messages to my friends on their PS3s. On the Vita you can handle multiple messages because the interface doesn't look like an inbox. It is set up more as a chat room. You can easily send a message to one person or to multiple recipients. You can check your friends list and see what they are playing whether they are on PS3 or Vita.The interface is a bit annoying at first. During set-up I was prompted to sign into PSN. I click on the button and I am told that I need to download a firmware update before signing into PSN. Why? Then I look at all of the apps which are represented by bubbles and I see nothing that looks like system settings or networking. However, one bubble in particular is THROBBING in a \"pick me, pick me!\" kind of way. Fire that one up and it is a tutorial and damn it, it's a voice over which slows things down considerably. You will actually hear a knock on a door and the voice will tell you about it. I quit the tutorial and look for some kind of settings option which is on a separate page (and no hint that you need to look elsewhere for it.) Thankfully you can manage the apps to appear on whatever page you like. Each game gets its own bubble and it will throb at you after the game is installed.The content manager is kind of interesting in that you handle moving files from the Vita itself. I used it with Windows 7 and if you want music, you tap the music button on the Vita and it lists all of the songs in your music folder on Windows. I was a little annoyed that the content manager only looks in My Pictures, My Music and My Videos. You might be able to change that if you want to add content from other folders but as of now I haven't located that option.Pictures taken with the vita camera look...ok. They are alright on the Vita screen but put them on a PC and they look like crap. Videos that you upload to Vita look alright. Not bad but not outstanding either.As for the games- right now I am playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Little Deviants and Escape Plan. The graphics are lush and beautiful but I wouldn't go so far as to say that they are PS3 quality. They are certainly the most detailed graphics of any handheld released to date. Many of these early games use the Vita's various inputs to some degree. For example, in Uncharted you can use the rear touchpad to climb ropes and tilt the Vita to maintain your character's balance. In Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 you can use the touchscreen to perform special moves. I will explain these in greater detail in the reviews for each game.Finally, the 3G. The maximum file size you can download over 3G is quite small and it does not support simultaneous multi-player like what you might see in a first-person shooter. Unless you have a pressing need to check your messages from your friends list or don't have a phone with a web browser, I say save $50 and get the Wi-Fi model of the Vita.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

Although I thought the game was short, and fairly easy to play, it was still a lot of fun.  Learning all of Spidey's combos takes time and practice, the grpahics are good, as is the sound and scenery in which Spider-Man flys throw the air.

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Batman fan or not, this game is worth experiencing","reviewText":"If you've read my review for Batman: Arkham Asylum, then you know that I loved it, yet I only rented it due to my \"code\" which demands that I only buy games based off Marvel comics since I'm a much bigger fan of that series as opposed to DC. However, I couldn't stand not being able to play the game again, so I eventually gave in and bought it... and I loved it even more. Naturally, I had to get Batman: Arkham City as well. Was it worth it? The answer to that question would be a big, fat \"YES\". Much like Arkham Asylum, Arkham City is a wonderfully crafted game with excellent combat, superb graphics, a gripping story, and simply oozing with dark atmosphere. If you have the DLC for Catwoman installed, then the game opens with the player in control of the thieving feline beating up some of Two-Face's thugs so she can get to his safe and steal something from him, only to end up getting captured by the duality obsessed thug himself. We are then switched over to the standard opening of the game and given control of the man himself... Bruce Wayne. That's right, we get to play for a bit as the impeccably dressed billionaire as he finds himself speaking at a televised protest for the purpose of closing down the newly built super prison Arkham City, which is basically an area of several square blocks of Gotham City that has been walled off to hold the vast collection of crazies that used to reside in Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Prison.The new warden of this ill-advised facility, Professor Hugo Strange, has his TYGER security guards bust up the protest and arrest Bruce Wayne, presumably for speaking out against the prison. However, the real reason that Strange had Bruce arrested was because he knows his dark secret... he knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman. Now with Batman captured, Strange can proceed with his master plan simply known as Protocol 10. After being thrown into Arkham City and being introduced to its welcoming committee consisting of Penguin and his thugs, Bruce gets his gear dropped off by the Batwing, courtesy of Alfred. Now, fully suited up, Batman begins his mission to stop whatever Protocol 10 is, as well as a presumably different plot being hatched by the Clown Prince of Crime himself, the Joker. The Dark Knight will be doing the usual beating up of stupid thugs, sneaking in the shadows to take out gun-wielding thugs silently, solving lots of puzzles, and doing lots of gliding and grapnel gun zipping along the rooftops of the prison. These gameplay elements, as well as the controls, are basically identical to those in Arkham Asylum, but since there was nothing bad about them in the first game, then it's actually really good that they haven't changed too much in this one. In other words: \"it ain't broke, so why fix it?\"As we all know, Arkham City is much more of a free-roaming environment than the more streamlined Arkham Island from the previous game. It's comparatively much smaller compared to the free-roaming environments found in other games such as Infamous, Prototype, and Red Dead Redemption, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. First of all, Arkham City is much more detailed in design (in a dark and dilapidated sort of way). Second of all, Arkham City is filled to the brim with all kinds of things to do and find. Plenty of iconic and interesting locations such as Penguin's museum, the Solomon Wayne Courthouse, and the Monarch Theater appear in Arkham City (even the location where Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered can be found somewhere in the city).  There are also plenty of those ever so cleverly designed Riddler challenges and trophies. Seriously, they're EVERYWHERE. You will literally find Riddler trophies hidden just several feet away from other ones in certain locations. If the environment were any larger, then it would simply be too much in my opinion. Even with the way it is, one can't help but feel a little overwhelmed with all the stuff there is to do in Arkham City when you first step into it, although eventually it becomes more manageable and that overwhelming feeling gets downgraded to staggering. Anyway, back to the Riddler trophies. Most of them will be unobtainable when you first find them, as they are usually locked in these little domes or hidden behind other traps that can only be opened/unlocked with one of Batman's many gadgets.Fortunately, Batman can mark these Riddler trophies on his map and come back to collect them after he has acquired one of the later gadgets that are needed to reach these trophies. Speaking of gadgets, Batman starts the game with most of the gear he finished the previous game with: his batarangs, remote controlled batarangs, explosive gel, grapnel gun, and batclaw. He also has smoke pellets (useful against gun-wielding enemies) and he eventually regains the line launcher. He'll even gain other useful gadgets such as a remote electrical charge, which fires a small blast of electricity that can be used to activate electrical machinery and shock enemies. He also gains a disruptor, which lets him disable enemy firearms and turrets. Batman's Detective Mode also makes a return (thank God) and it is again essential when finding hidden items and getting a lay of the land when sneaking around in the darkness during the predator (stealth) sessions peppered throughout the game. Batman can perch atop gargoyle statues or other high platforms and take down enemies in the same manner as he did in the previous game. Occasionally, some enemies will lay down mines to make walking around more dangerous for Batman, and other enemies will have jammers that will disrupt his Detective Mode: taking out these enemies first is of course a high priority.Batman's vast array of butt kicking and head cracking moves are just as fluid and graceful as ever with his familiar attack, cape stun, counter, and dodge roll moves making a comeback, but the Caped Crusader has a few new tricks in his utility belt. With the new \"quickfire\" mechanic added into the controls, he can now integrate more of his gadgets like the explosive gel, remote electrical charge, and others into his attacks, along with the standard batarang and batclaw attacks from before. Batman can also now counter three attacking enemies at the same time, counter enemies who throw things at him, as well as pummel a single enemy repeatedly with a flurry of lightning quick jabs (this move is appropriately called the \"Beatdown\"). All these moves and gadgets can of course be upgraded with experience points. As one would expect, Batman's \"traversal moves\" have also been upgraded. While gliding around in the sky he can perform a divebomb move that lets him shoot downward at great speed, then when he pulls up he gains more altitude for gliding, letting him cover longer distances. He can now even use his grapnel gun while gliding to zip himself to a building or simply glide out of his grapnel swing to gain even more altitude and speed. Some of these new additions to the controls do take getting used to, especially the gliding and \"quickfire\" gadget attacks, but before long you'll be doing it all seamlessly and stylishly.The other playable character, Catwoman, actually plays very similarly to Batman and has her own collection of fancy moves that let her beat up a small army of thugs. Her weapons are a whip, bolas, and caltrops, all with their own \"quickfire\" attacks. She's also a bit faster with her attacks. Her traversal moves aren't as seamless or easy to execute as Batman's, but they still work; she uses her whip to swing towards buildings and then latches onto their walls with her claws, allowing her to leapfrog (or \"leapcat\") up the side of the building. She also has goggles that give her what can be called \"Thief Mode\", which lets her see things in a purplish haze and highlights enemies and important items, but no sidebar descriptions accompany what she's looking at like with Batman's Detective Mode. Her Thief Mode is ultimately less useful than Detective Mode, but it still serves its purpose. Catwoman can also climb up and along certain walls and ceilings with her claws, allowing her to silently take down enemies from above, reach areas that Batman can't get to, and collect Riddler trophies that have been left specifically for her.One other change to the gameplay is the somewhat more challenging enemies. A lot of the standard types of thug enemies from the previous game return, with the only changes being their appearances which depend on what villain they work for, whether it's Joker, Penguin, Two-Face, etc. The tougher enemies include guys armed with knives, guys with riot shields, guys wearing body armor, and... even ninjas. Battles against large groups of these types of enemies can be very dangerous for Batman. The boss fights have also improved and are more well-rounded with Batman facing a couple of other TITAN-infused thugs, as well as an arena type battle with Solomon Grundy, mystical fisticuffs with Ra's Al Ghul, a unique game of hide-and-go-beat up with Mr. Freeze, and a more appropriately challenging final boss battle against a rather surprising enemy. Aside from this already impressive gathering of villains, others appear in the game's side missions which are all miniature adventures with their own stories attached to them, and they all have multiple stages/levels before they can be completed. One consists of several races against time where Batman must get from one side of Arkham City to the other and answer a ringing phone before the clock runs down to zero, otherwise the psychotic Zsasz will kill a helpless victim. Another has Batman following bullet trajectories with his Detective Mode to hunt down Deadshot as he assassinates political prisoners in Arkham City. Probably the more memorable side mission is where Batman must rescue hostages from these elaborate traps set up by the Riddler (who has obviously seen several, if not all, of the SAW films). These and most of the other side missions eventually culminate in a final encounter between Batman and the villains in question. Sidenote: as someone who has come to truly loathe the Riddler and his little games, I found the final confrontation with him to be by far the most euphorically satisfying.This may not need to be said, but there are indeed a lot of villains and characters in this game, with a couple of them appearing only for mere minutes. With all these different characters and stories packed into this one game, I agree with other reviewers that the story does tend to get a little jumbled here and there, and certain other villains get less camera time than they probably should have, especially Hugo Strange; his knowledge of Batman's identity could have been used as a very interesting story element that could have proved very threatening for Batman, but alas it doesn't get touched upon enough to be of much importance to the main plot. Still, the story we get proves to be quite interesting on its own, especially during the last few missions where a few genuinely \"wow\" moments are thrown at us. If I had to leave a solid complaint, it would be that there are simply too many Riddler trophies and challenges in this game (more than twice the amount found in the first game). Most are easy to find, but take work to get to. However, a relatively select few are an absolute chore to locate, even if you check and recheck every possible nook and cranny in the city... and there are many. I also don't see why the Catwoman missions couldn't have just come directly with the game instead of having to be added as DLC.Even after the main and side missions are done, we've got plenty of those awesome challenge maps to pass the time with. Another quick praise has to go to the superb voice acting in this game, with Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy once again working their magic in their respectively iconic roles of Joker and Batman. In closing, Batman: Arkham City really is somewhat of an \"expansion pack\" of Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it's a darn good one. While there simply wasn't much to improve on with Arkham Asylum, Rocksteady has managed to actually take it further and add just enough new stuff in Arkham City to make it an overall better game, if a little less cohesive with the story. Other reviewers made the classic mistake of letting the hype for this game get to them and in the end they found this game to be disappointing. To those of you who haven't played this game yet, don't get caught up in the hype because it can kill any game if you let it, even one as great as this one. If you go into this game with an open mind and take your time to familiarize yourself with its subtleties and the rich world it puts you in, then you will most certainly enjoy it. Buy it, rent it, conjure it through use of the dark arts, I don't care... just give this game a shot.*Update*This next part will be dedicated to the DLC called Harley Quinn's Revenge. Taking place 2 weeks after the end of the main game, Robin heads into Arkham City to find out what happened to Batman, who has been missing for the past two days after he went back into the giant prison to put a stop to some mischief being brewed by Harley Quinn. We start in control of the Boy Wonder who, much like Catwoman, also controls similarly to Batman, but there are subtle differences. Like his mentor, Robin can use his cape to glide short distances and he has his own grapnel gun that lets him shoot himself up to ledges and so on. His other gadgets include shurikens (his own version of batarangs), explosive gel, the zip-kick (similar to the batclaw, but lets Robin launch himself towards enemies or horizontal grapple points), and the snap flash (tiny explosives that can be placed onto unaware enemies or objects close to them and then detonated). Robin's bo staff can even be opened up into a shield that can temporarily protect him from gunfire and environmental hazards; he also routinely works the staff into his regular combos when beating up enemies. And of course there's Detective Mode (whew). Batman will also be controllable at some point and he's armed with EVERY gadget he had on him by the end of the main game: batarangs, line launcher, freeze blast, cryptographic sequencer, etc. Both heroes will take part in the same action sequences that have become staples in the series: beating up thugs and sneaking around in the shadows to take down armed enemies. The enemies are nothing new and include the usual standard thugs, thugs with knives, thugs with shock batons, thugs with riot shields, and one TITAN-infused sub-boss. Sadly, no actual boss fights. A somewhat new enemy type is introduced in the final encounter, but they're basically slightly tougher versions of standard thugs.The game mostly takes place in a new area of Arkham City, the shipyard building, making this adventure considerably more linear. However, during one of Batman's play sessions, you'll be able to free-roam the Industrial District for a short time (the rest of Arkham City is off-limits). Aside from the new locale, there's really nothing new gameplaywise that Harley Quinn's Revenge offers to players. The only collectibles in this game are Harley Quinn-themed balloons to pop and speakers to destroy. All you get for finding them all is a PS3 trophy, so no biggy (at least there aren't any Riddler trophies or challenges, I'm tired of those). The story is actually very straightforward and doesn't really offer any surprises or twists, which I was kind of hoping for given how the main game ended. I was even hoping for a couple of the other villains that Batman encountered but didn't defeat in the main game to at least make quick appearances, like maybe Killer Croc or Hush. No such luck, I'm afraid. Playing this DLC is very much like taking part in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series: Batman and Robin go in to stop the bad guy (in this case, bad girl), they have to save hostages, get out of deadly traps, and in the end defeat the bad girl. To be honest, that's all well and good. Playing in the world of Arkham City is just as fun and addicting as it ever was. Unfortunately, this game is far too short, almost criminally so. Even first-timers who take their sweet time playing this game should be able to beat it in no more than two and a half hours. This shortness also gives players little opportunity to really use Robin's specialized gadgets. I actually think spending $10 on such a short DLC was a bit much, it simply needed more content. If a follow-up DLC is released in the future, I'm hoping it will have more content, or at least cost less if it ends up being as short as this one. Still, I liked Harley Quinn's Revenge and I don't regret buying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Redmond","summary":"Good Game","reviewText":"In some ways inFamous is groundbreaking (a quality shared by it's comrade-in-arms Prototype), but in other ways it's just GTA with lightning bolts and less-humorous civilians walking around.  The redeeming quality here, though, is that it's GTA with lightning bolts!When I say GTA I mean only that it is a persistent game world.  There aren't \"zones\" or \"instances\".  The game, overall, is pretty fun.  Unlike Prototype you don't get more frustrated as the story goes along because the city is becoming more and more of a pain to navigate.  On the contrary -- as you play the game you can do side missions to actually clear out the bad guys in the city (or the weak bad guys if you're bad).  Some of the enemies are a bit annoying to fight but only in ways that make them challenging.The story is fairly simple and straightforward:  city go boom you go sparky, now you figure it out.  There are some minor twists and turns in the plot... but I will say (without ruining anything) that the ending was one of the more satisfying I have experienced in the gaming world in awhile.The reason I only gave this 4 stars is because for me it didn't take much for the game to lose it's luster.  It doesn't have much of a replayability factor for me unless I feel froggy enough to replay the game as the opposing moral side.  It is a great game... I just don't know if I'll want to play through it again.Long story -- inFamous is a fun game and if you own a PS3 and not this game, you should slap yourself.  I mean come on... it's one of the few PS3 exclusives for crying out loud!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2009"}

Instead of being developed by Gas Powered Games, Dungeon Siege III is developed by Obsidian Entertainment. This game is a dungeon crawler, hack 'n' slash similar to Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Diablo, etc. I am seeing a lot of 1-star reviews, which I promise are completely and utterly unreliable; Dungeon Siege III is in no way a 1-star game, and anyone who says so isn't being very honest with their assessment. Ok, now with that out of the way, let's get to the review.Positives:- Hack 'n' Slash Goodness - This is an isometric, top down, dungeon crawler role-playing game, so of course the graphics won't be those of an Uncharted, Gears of War, etc. However, does that mean it's not a $59.99 game? Of course not. People are acting as if only one style of game can succeed at a $59.99 retail price, which just isn't true. Torchlight is great, but it's shorter than Dungeon Siege III and has less visual flourish. The action in Dungeon Siege III works good and feels good. An isometric role-playing game will never feel as personal as a game that has a closer perspective, but it all feels good, and I like isometric games.- A Visually Impressive Isometric Role-Playing Game - While it won't wow those who've just come off the big budget, Hollywood-inspired blockbusters, Dungeon Siege III will certainly wow you in comparison to other role-playing games of its kind. Detailed environments, tremendous lighting effects, etc., make for a beautiful adventure. However, the characters lack the finite details.- Co-op - Some have complained about the co-op in the past, but it's handled relatively well and feels seamless for the most part. It's easy to get into a game and have fun with friends. Yes, some things could've been handled better, but it still functions well enough.- Story - Pretty generic fantasy stuff aside, Dungeon Siege III brings dialogue trees to a subgenre of role-playing games that hasn't really seen it done much before.- Gameplay Variety Through Characters - There are 4 characters to choose from at the beginning of your adventure, and they are Lucas, Anjali, Reinhart, and Katarina. Each character plays differently and allows for multiple playthroughs with variation in gameplay. You'll also gain them as companions throughout your quest.Negatives:- Not Everything is Beautiful - You'll spot some weak environment texture detail here and there, you'll see a little visual flaw every once in a while, and the characters aren't super detailed.- Jeyne Kassynder - Stop saying her name over and over again!At its core, Dungeon Siege is a subgenre of role-playing games that has existed well before this generation, and as full retail priced games as well. You may remember Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Fallout 1 & 2, Diablo, Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and the list goes on. Even in their day, these games weren't the graphics pushers, yet they were still worth the prices that they were commanding, and Dungeon Siege III is no different. This is a larger and more impressive looking hack 'n' slash, dungeon crawling role-playing game than any on Xbox Live Arcade or Playstation Network. It's surely not perfect, but it is a great game regardless. I have no idea what's with the similar 1-star reviews, so I'm assuming there's some movement out there with a personal grudge, and they're too busy with the grudge to write a fair and honest assessment of the game.Well, here I am, and I promise you that this is a fair and honest assessment of Dungeon Siege III, as you can see that this is an Amazon Verified Purchase.Happy gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

You still seek to kill Zeus and you have the Titans helping you get there.Let's say, upfront, this might be the best looking game in history. It is a technical marvel. Kratos looks like a real person, the levels are crazy detailed, the framerate almost never chugs (it did for me one time at the very end out of nowhere) and load times are hidden behind in-engine cutscenes so they are never apparent. Sure, unskippable cutscenes are an annoyance, but the story is solid herr and you are unlikely to want to skip them anyway.The combat, as always, is easy to pick up but difficult to really master. Adding the ability to change weapons in mid-combo was inspired and opens things up all the more. You do have to change tactics based on your enemy as some seem impervious to combos, but are quite susceptible to grapples. When at its frenetic apex, it almost looks like a choreographed fight scene in a movie.Sure, there are some quibbles. Fixed perspective is irksome and there are two small parts of the game I hated...but they lasted about 2 minutes each, so it'd take some nitpicking to really bitch.This is an absolute must-buy and a heavy contender for GOTY.

So, in all fairness, I now have to say this: DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS IS A GAMER's DREAM! It is an excellent game collection which (unfortunately...) does not come free of DRM madness. The original game and its expansion have only a simple disk-check; however, for some unfathomable reason, the DLCs/Packs in this edition have to be...downloaded (and activated) from EA's site. So, thank you EA for trying to listen to your customers but too bad you missed the cigar for not been able to hold it together to the end.This is one of those games that are easy to control, a joy to roam through and fun to play at no end.I am a huge cRPG fan and cannot remember such a great companion/squad cRPG ever since the Baldur's Gate Saga. And to tell you the truth, this is the game I was dreaming of being able to play one day while playing BG (yeah, by now we all know that NEVERWINTER NIGHTS never delivered).There are about a dozen gender/race/class/background choices and a great many combinations in forming your party. The armor and the weapons are exceptionally made and everything shows on your characters. And the graphics are truly beautiful! You have to see the rendering of flames to believe them.Nevertheless, what really stands out is the gameplay. Every battle is a puzzle to be solved, pausing ever so often to reallocate enemies to the best suited party members (a feature I loved in BG!). Of course one can always turn off the autopause feature and let the AI take over the rest of your party and turn the game into an hack&slash; action RPG (not exactly my cup of tea but, hey, it's still nice to know it's there).Finally, this is a game made just like the classics in many ways, including duration. I have been playing the game for hours at no end and I feel the urge to start over the moment I reach the epilogue. Now DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS is one satisfying RPG!My only gripe is this: I did not appreciate such short dialogue options. Most fit a single line and more often than not they consist of a couple of words. I like my RPGs to be wordy and challenging to my verbal imagination as well - and I want my characters to participate in the humor, not just provoke it or react to it. Remember the long dialogue options in BG? Well, expect to find DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS much more laconic.I guess 10 years of fast-paced FPS and blitzkrieging RTS do take their toll...This ULTIMATE EDITION not only contains both the original game and its AWAKENINGS expansion but also all nine Content Packs. For such an epic game to be sold at this price, this is a bargain not to be missed!The blood sprays, the swords clang and the spells explode. The animations are beautifully made and add a lot to both enjoyment and immersion. There is a verse in Homer's Iliad I love: \"the warrior fell, his armor echoing around him\" - and I was reminded of it many a times throughout the game.The game is now complete and it will stay with you for a very long time.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2010"}

Not stellar by any stretch of the imagination but decent overall.Lets start with the good:The graphics are solid and it's evident that the developers put a good deal of time into creating a detailed, interesting and appropriate atmosphere.  The creatures you battle are creative and varied and overall the game succeeds in this category.The voice work is above average and there are plenty of humorous comments scattered about to break up the monotony.  The soundtrack fits the game play.  You may not like heavy metal but really, what else would fit a game where you are basically destroying everything in your path?The mechanics of the game are good when you are fighting and moving around throughout the levels, with one noted exception which I'll address later.  Make no mistake, this game is a button masher.  Yes, there are combos you can learn as you work your way through the game but they are just more button mash-y goodness.A plus with the game is the ability to restore your health during battles.  This feature impacts the game significantly.  Early on it makes it practically impossible to die but as the battles get harder, you'll need it believe me.The game is a gore fest.  I mean an arm ripping, decapitating, sick, twisted, bloody, mutilated, gore fest.  It's called Splatterhouse so what did you expect?  This is good for some I suppose but read on and see that it can be bad as well.Now onto the Not-So-Good:My number one complaint about this game without a doubt is the platforming portions.  First off, they seem gimmicky and don't really fit the game overall and no, I don't care about any throw backs to previous games. Worse yet is the fact that they are fixed camera and the camera is almost always in an awkward position where you can't really see what you are doing. When you need the camera beside you, it's positioned behind you, etc.  It adds a layer of difficulty that is just irritating and completely unnecessary.  Then to make matters worse, the controls while playing these areas are not nearly as responsive as they need to be.  For example, you have to sprint past some giant something-or-other that is trying to squash you but your character keeps on running even after you release the button so you typically run into some other object that smashes you or slices you in half, etc.  Nice, lovely.  The same is true for rolling under objects too.  Jumping thankfully doesn't seem that bad but the other moves mean you'll get to play the same section over and over again.Another issue is with the LOAD times.  They are ridiculous.  I'm not talking about load times between chapters either, I'm referring to the load times when you die. Get used to seeing the same scrawny monster load screens because they are frequent and way too long.  If you are a player that is having problems and dying a lot, who knows how many hours you'll see of the load screens.  Seriously.The game is a gore fest.  Now, again I'm not saying that is a bad thing because it is called SPLATTERhouse but there were times when I was on a killing rampage and there was so much blood splattered all over the screen that literally I couldn't see the characters,including the enemies.  I mean, blood splattered all over the walls, ceiling and floor is fine but is it really necessary to have it completely coat the camera lens?  No, it is not.So in summary, this game is decent, pure button mashing, mindless fun.  The kind of game you can pick up and play a bit and then move on. I wasn't expecting much in the way of storyline so I wasn't disappointed.  If you were a fan of the previous Splatterhouse games then buying this is probably a no brainer.  It is a great looking shiny upgrade to previous versions.  If you are looking for deep or complex storyline, then look elsewhere.  Personally, I think the game is worth the purchase but not at full price.  Buy it when its on sale, pick up a used copy or rent it first and see if you like it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

In fact, let's start with that. For a game of this size, and with all the bad press I'd been hearing (and maybe because of that), I felt it was actually very bug free. I kept a freeze counter; the first one occurred 20-25 hours in, but considering I played for almost 300 hours and experienced about a dozen more, it was very rarely a problem. As for glitched/unfinishable quests, I encountered just six (though none prevented me from platinuming the game), one in a primary quest, and five in miscellaneous objectives. FYI, I played the entire game after installing patch 1.9, which (reportedly) got rid of a lot of bugs, and added Legendary difficulty and Legendary skills - two options I could barely imagine playing the game without.PROS: No game features more freedom; to play the quests in the order you want, to build your character the way you want, and to explore the world how you want.The combat is way better than Skyrim's predecessor, Oblivion.It features an amazing world/map. My favorite part of the experience was exploring.*There are so many ways to build and equip a character. Do you want to build a warrior-mage? Or a nearly invisible thief who kills with stealth? Or some combination of all three? There exist seven weapons (four one handed, three two handed, all of varying levels), a multitude of shields, scores of magical spells, dozens of staffs, and even (if you're so inclined) your fists. And, of course, a vast assortment of armor and clothing to adorn your character.No other game has done dragons as well. They look much like your traditional dragons, but are well rendered, awe inspiring, dynamic and deadly. Your first few encounters with them will be long remembered.Loads of content/quests. Skyrim easily took the cake for the longest I've ever played one game: 285 hours. (Did loading screens count though?) It took about 180 hours to visit all nine cities and about 250 to complete the main quest.Huge diversity of indoor areas. No two caves, lairs, vaults, crypts, dungeons or keeps were identical (or barely even alike). Everywhere you went you were literally seeing it for the first time. Remember Dragon Age 2? I didn't think it was so bad at the time, but after Skyrim, Bioware should be embarrassed with the (lack of) effort put into the map variety in that game.Grand, beautiful music that (usually) knew when to swell and when to shut up.J'zargo!A perfectly usable third person perspective, something sorely lacking from Oblivion.Surprisingly unbuggy (relative to the reviews I'd read). For comparison, I played Fallout 3: GOTY edition (another Bethesda game) and found it unplayable after about the 75 hour mark (possibly due to the 15 mb save file). Skyrim was still chugging along well even at the end (with rare lagginess). Though thinking back, the key was probably that I fast traveled everywhere, spending as little time 'outdoors' as possible. And again, that I played entirely on version 1.9. You just have to know that with Bethesda, don't start playing until several months after the release date.CONS: The combat still doesn't compare well to RPGs like Dragon Age, Demons/Dark Souls or KOA: Reckoning. It still felt too much like swinging chopsticks in front of your face.Skyrim was probably a little too long. Instead of making the game longer/bigger, it would've benefited from using all that time and energy on refining it (even if it meant losing 100+ hours of gameplay). Get rid of the bugs, refine the combat, feature more enemy variety, shrink the world, and I'd be very happy with a 150 hour game.Even after patch 1.9, it was still buggier than the aforementioned RPGs (e.g. minor quest bugs, freezing, lagginess, occasional very long load times, bodies falling through floors, weapons disappearing from hands, etc.).Loading screens were too frequent and too long. If loading screens count toward play time, then I would've been under 250 hours for 'actual playing time.' This also goes back to the game being too long: Make the game world smaller, but reduce the frequency and times of loading screens.It was generally too easy. (I had to change the way I played to make it more challenging.) My changes in difficulty went as such: Adept 0-20 hours, Expert 20-70, Master 70-120, and Legendary the rest of the way.The skill/character building got a bit tedious after about the 100 hour mark. Like KOA: Reckoning, respeccing would have helped keep it fresh. (I don't care that it was in the DLC.) Patch 1.9's Legendary skills (that allowed you to reset a skill and regain all the perks) helped, but not completely.It needed more 'wow' spells and abilities; things that made you say, 'that's fu--ing awesome!' Think of the meteor spell in KOA, or 'firestorm' in Dragon Age. Skyrim had 'mass paralysis' and the Dawnbreaker sword, but could've (and should've) had more.A small quip, but I wanted to (and thought I would) fight two dragons at once. Sadly, that never happened. The closest was when I called in my own dragon to fight another dragon, or when...-------------------------------------------------* While exploring, I decided to find out what was on the other side of a mountain. I made my way up past a giant statue of Talos, down a steep hill, fought two trolls, then woke an ancient dragon (that breathed fire and ice) and a draugr overlord. It took all my skills (e.g. Sanguine Rose, recharging weapons with soul gems, using potions and shouts, changing apparel) to survive that encounter. I also recall my follower, Lydia, using the Dawnbreaker sword to cause a chain reaction of explosions among a group of skeletons. It was an incredible adventure completely unrelated to any quest.Before that, I happened upon a lighthouse and discovered a murdered family inside. That motivated an investigation that brought me into a deep underground maze populated by giant insects, and eventually to the queen herself.Conclusion: If you like RPGs even slightly, buy this game. You can get the vanilla version, which features enough content to keep you busy for months, for about $20. Do it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001ATHKVC","reviewerName":"Nanohead \"nanohead\"","summary":"For me, better than the first installment....Warheads a winner","reviewText":"First things first.  I played through this game in its entirety.  I also have a hefty gaming machine that has plenty of power to run it.  And I purchased it from Steam.  While I hate these draconian DRM schemes as much as everyone else, they have rarely gotten in my way.  So I want to share my thoughts about Crysis Warhead, instead of the DRM problem.I struggled with the original Crysis.  There was WAAAYY to much hype and noise around it.  I played through it several times, hoping I would \"get it\" eventually.  I did warm up to it, but it never grabbed me the way many other games did and do.  But as a devoted FPS junkie, I do consider it a fine game, although not one of my all time favorites.  There were too many things about it that were either derivative, or simply painful to play.Now Crysis Warhead on the other hand, was simply terrific.  Yes, it is Crysis, and yes you need a hefty piece of hardware to run it, but the story, the playability, the pace and the gunplay for me at least were far superior to the original.  It seemed smoother to play, the battles more enjoyable, and there were less head scratching moments where I had no idea what was happening.  It all made sense, and the weapons were good from the beginning.  The voice acting is actually really really good, and the Psycho Sikes character, as well as Commander Emerson were really great, and made the game feel as though it was happening.  This plus the pacing, made it an excellent game for me,One thing I simply did NOT enjoy from the first Crysis was the time wasted inside the alien mountain/spaceship/hovel or whatever it was.  Fortunately, there was none of that this time.  Also, this game is much, much more refined than the original in almost every way.This campaign was shorter of course, as it was an expansion pack.  I played through in about 12 hours or so.  I WILL play it again, as I enjoyed it immensely.I do agree that these viral DRM approaches are not really logical, sound and is many cases probably not even legal,  I wish we could all give opinions of the games and the developers effort, rather than the publishers absurd beliefs about copy protection schemes.  It is a quandary for sure, one which will work itself out.But for now, Crysis Warhead is in my opinion, a huge refined improvement over Crysis, and a great deal of fun as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2009"}

However, they're still too long.  Do we really need to see the \"Shuffle-tron\" mix up the orbs for 10 seconds every time someone lands on that space?  It still takes an hour to play a 10-turn game; you could play a 20-turn game in the same amount of time on the Nintendo 64 Mario Party games.I still don't like the idea of \"orbs,\" as opposed to buying items directly from shops in the older games.  Everyone is constantly getting free random orbs, and most of them affect a certain space on the board, rather than doing something good to the player or bad to another player.  So you have a lot less control of what your items do, and a lot less control over what items you have in your stash.The mini-games, the heart and soul of Mario Party, are more fun this time around than in MP5; it seems they attemped to be a little less derivative and a little more creative.  I especially liked the snowboarding game.  And the graphics look fantastic during the games.  There is one game where you must smash rocks that are blocking a road, and you are driven in a car by a Shyguy.  The graphics looked so cool that I wanted to drive the car myself!  Why not let us drive the car, Nintendo??The boards are a bit more creative, too.  It's about time we get away from the standard \"ice, water, jungle\" stages, and the garage stage is a welcome departure.  The \"nighttime, daytime\" gimmick is just that, and doesn't really affect the game in a meaningful way.The mini-game competitions (that you can play outside the board game) are cool, especially the bingo game.  But nothing will top the Duel Mode that was included with Mario Party 3, still the best game in the series.  Duel Mode, a completely different board game for two players that reminded me of turn-based RPG battles, could have stood on its own as a separately sold game.Not having a microphone, I can't comment on the voice-activated portion of the game.  But I'm glad that Nintendo is still introducing new innovations, even six games into the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2005"}

Amazon's current price of $20 isn't bad, and if you can hold out for sales such as the one that ran Cyber Monday ($15, I believe), even better.So, star off for the price.Otherwise, this is a memory card. It does what memory cards do. You store your games, saves, videos, etc. on it.8GB is a decent amount of space for the casual user, enough to hold 2 AAA titles (which are getting close to 4GB each now) or LOADS of smaller titles (PSP and PSX games can be just a few hundred megs, PS minis even smaller, and lesser Vita games about 1GB each).In physical size, the card is TINY, so if you plan to switch cards from time to time have a good storage option available. VERY easy to lose one otherwise.Take note, if you are a Playstation Plus subscriber, you'll probably want a larger card or multiple 8GB cards, because you'll have more games than you can handle within months. I have three of these filled and still can't fit everything I've gotten with my subscription over the last year.Otherwise, for most users this is a solid, affordable option for your digital downloads.

The producers made this game with this intent in mind.  So you're not going to see anything incredibly revolutionary, like the (at the time) incredible graphics of FF 7 or the crazy gameplay system of FF8.  Instead, what you will find is a simply well-made, enjoyable game.There has been lots of controversy over the quality of the Playstation Final Fantasy games, and my interpretation of this will be no different.  This game seemed like the best in the series to me, since it was a well made game.  There were no screwed up battle systems like in FF8, the plot was actually consistent and made sense, unlike FF7, and the graphics were in general great.  In terms of craftsmanship, the only Final Fantasy which is close (if not better) is FF 6.The gameplay was excellent.  The item-ability system was reminiscent of the Esper system in FF6, the trance system of the limit system in FF7 and FF8, and the synthesis system from FF8.  All these elements come together to make a game that is fun to play.  While the random battles can become a drag, the sheer graphical quality of the fights is enough to make at least the first few ones in each area enjoyable.The world map is also the largest in the series.  While there aren't multiple world maps, there are enough areas in the game to keep you occupied.  This means there are plenty of side quests to do, in addition to being able to simply explore lots of places.  Each individual town is larger, on average, than any of those in the FF series which came before.Graphically speaking, this game is incredible.  Not just in the technical aspects, but also in the creativity exercised by the artists in this game.  No other Final Fantasy comes close to the wonderful way the artists were able to make this world come alive.  Every new area is shockingly refreshing and new.  The summons, like FF8, are beautiful, but they aren't long.The music was pretty good.  If I had to pick a part of the game that was weakest, this would be it.  But it still good, and much of it did a good job of accompanying what was happening on the screen.  It's especially wonderful to listen to various pieces of music after finishing the game and reminiscing about those parts.Finally, the story was superb.  It made sense and what happened near the end of the game was especially interesting.  If anything, this game is worth buying just to see Vivi.  He's the most incredible character in the entire Final Fantasy series.You aren't going to find anything revolutionary here.  Instead, what you'll find is a well-made, enjoyable game.  This is the last Final Fantasy of its kind, and like those before it, it doesn't disappoint!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2001"}

The humans, you see, contain vital nutrients in their brain stems. Your job is to harvest those brain stems while completing other various objectives. All the while, goofy humour is injected almost everywhere possible.Gameplay is fairly straightforward, done in open-world style. \"Levels\" take place in various different arenas, ranging from a country fairground to sprawling urban settings.

The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"Will","summary":"Impressive to say the Least","reviewText":"I enjoyed The Getaway to a great extent.  It has a twisted deep storyline, realistic graphics, and superb voice acting.  You play two characters Mark Hammond, and a cop (Who's name I forgot).  Hammond's story revolves around him doing favors for the Mafia boss Charlie Jolson to get his son back.  Where as the cop's story intertwines with that of Hammonds.  London has been recreated in this game...exactly...down to every storefront.  So I assume, if your familiar with London, then you have an advantage.  Be forewarned though, this game wanted to get accross that you are playing a movie.  That means, there are no ammo counts, no health bars, no health pickups, or maps.  To get around London, you must follow your turn signals on your car.  And if your turn lights are busted up then you need to jack a new car.  You can tell how much health you have by how much Hammond limps (or bleeds.  Perhaps The Getaway's biggest downfall is the gameplay.  I got very tired of watching the characters slow sluggish movement (and when he limps he moves an inch a minute).  To heal your self you must lean up against a wall and wait...and wait...until the bloody or limp disappears.  The targeting system is also a point of concern.  It thinks that some chump a mile off is more dangerous than some guy with a shotgun right next to me.  The cutscenes in this movie, while very long, are very entertaining and lifelike.  The charters in these scenese are so believable I swear I could point them out in real life.  Overall I throughly enjoyed this game.  Oh yeah and one other thing, this game has an \"M\" rating for a reason.  The F word is used constantly.  The violence isnt' all that bad but none of it was really offending to me.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"This game was disappointing","reviewText":"I had high hopes for New Super Mario Bros. 2, but it hardly met my expectations. I expected that Nintendo (who are always making creative games and having Mario in the strangest concepts) would put some kind of unique twist in the game. I thought  that they would do something creative with the idea of collecting coins. I was wrong. This is the first time I have ever felt ripped off by Nintendo. The idea of having thousands of coins per level stated in the advertisments is not in the game. New Super Mario Bros 2 has a few more coins then the average Mario game, but not enough to focus the entire game around gold. And what am I supposed to do with these coins? Buy items with them? Pay Bowser free peach? The only thing I was able to do with them was watch them pile up on the title screen and try to the goal of one million coins. I really had high hopes for the plotline too. I am getting so sick seeing the princess kidnapped. It used to be quite fun and interesting. Bowser's kids pop out of Princess Peach's birthday cake and kidnap her. A few years ago Bowser was preparing to invade the galaxy and litteraly ripped Peach's castle out of the ground and took it to the center of the universe. But it seems that Bowser has lost his creativity. New Super Mario Bros 2 opens with Mario and Luigi flying off the castle roof in raccoon suits and watch as Bowser comes along in his Koopa Clown Car to kidnap the princess. People had really funny ideas about the plotline, too. )\"OH! Mario is sick of saving the princess on a plumber salary and is jealous that Luigi won a mansion and came back with a ton of gold!\" \"Mario is collecting 1,000,000 coins because he needs to pay off his debt to Tom Nook!\"). The level design is also quite bland and easy. I have earned so many lives due to coins that even the most challenging levels never give me a game over. I am starting to wonder if the game even has one. Most of the levels I have already seen in the other Mario games. Some levels are very fun to play, but that is not very often. The boss fights get repetitive. Remember those Renzor dinosaurs on the giant wheel in Super Mario World? They are back! Fans of them will be happy because you get to fight them in every world! A single fight would have been great, but to fight them in every fortress just gets annoying. As for the power ups, they COULD have rocked. Mario gets his standard Fire Flower, Mushroom, Mini-mushroom, and Starman. He also gets the raccoon leaf, which is pretty much a standard by this point. Along with this the Mega Mushroom returns, but it is SUPER RARE and really lame. Mario still gets to turn into a giant and crush everything in his path, but thats it. The destruction meter that rewarded me with 1-ups in the original New Super Mario Bros was missing. The Gold Flower was plain awesome. Mario can shoot huge blast at bricks and enemies and turn them into coins. The problem is that (1.) the Gold Flower is rare and (2.) the Gold Flower only last for one level. That means after completing a level I have to find another Gold Flower somewhere else. And the game has many other minor flaws (like having no new soundtrack and a short length), but I will not go on. I'm really quite dissapointed. Could the company who made games like Mario Galaxy and Super Mario World really have let me down? If they wanted they could have just gone with \"It's a fun Mario game\" and everybody would have liked it. But to say \"It has a ton of coins! Can you collect one million?\" and fail is just another reason to break out Super Mario World and try to forget that this happened. If you find it cheap and can ignore the whole concept of collecting one million coins, you might be able to get some enjoyment out of this game, but most people will find that downloading Mario 3 on Wii for 5 bucks is a much better deal.Update: Nintendo just released their own idea of DLC expansion packs, Mario levels are now available for purchase. I have to admit, I did not see this coming. The idea of buying packages of 3 levels each is crazy and a weird concept for a Mario game, but it is a big step for Nintendo, I guess.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B008E6ZXTA","description":"","reviewerName":"David Rey \"dmajor\"","summary":"Initial Impression","reviewText":"Ok I have never played the DOOM games before but i always wanted to.  I bought this game at Game Stop last night cause i didn't want to wait to have Amazon deliver it.  I put in a few hours into Doom 3 and played about 30 min of Doom 1 and Doom 2.  The fact that they come with trophy support just makes this game even more enticing.In that short span of time the game froze on me once and i had to hard restart my ps3.  Also the loading times after you die or to save the game are really long.  So long i think i counted 2 minutes one time waiting for an area to load.  For that reason I took off a star cause i'm not sure if that will happen again.So far here is my  experience for each game:Doom 1- I never played this back when it came out so it feels and looks very dated to me.  But that being said, I had a LOT of fun with this in the short amount of time i played it and I am looking forward to going home to play it some more.  Yes it looks old but there is something very endearing about this game.  No wonder it caught on so well.Doom 2-  Feels just like Doom 1 with different maps.  I'm sure it changes up later but for the short period of time, it felt just like Doom 1.  Some how i foresee myself liking this one the least but we shall see.Doom 3-  Looks great.  Nice to see the graphics updated and the guns feel great.  In the 3 hours I played it did make me jump a few times.  It has a very claustrophobic feel to it.  I just hope I don't become bored of the setting but they will probably switch up the environment later in the game.So for $40 I got 3 awesome games and some expansion packs for Doom 3.  This is a great deal and if you are a fame of horror and shooters, you would probably love this, esp. if you liked the FEAR series.  It's a great deal and fun games.  What more can you ask for?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4.

It is almost as if the game itself evolved into something much more than it was.  The biggest change in the series has to be dumping the zombies from the game.  Now we have hostile villagers who will come at you with whatever is lying around, things like pitchforks, knifes, torches, or just their bare hands.You play Leon Kennedy again who is searching for the President's daughter in Europe.  Once you arrive in town you notice the villagers are not friendly and obviously want you dead for no apparent reason.  Capcom has finally realized that there are things scarier than zombies moaning at the moon.  The thing that makes these villagers scary is the fact that they have brains.  If they realize they can't fight you, they'll get others who are around and then try to trap you.  Fortunately, you have a great arsenal this time around and the ability to interact with the environment.Want to block the door with a shelf, hold the A button and stop when it's there.  Want to make sure those people don't get you on the second floor, knock down their ladders.  Of course, they'll still find a way to get to where you are or at least attack you.  Whatever safety you felt on the other end of a door in previous titles, is lost in this game, doors are as flimsy in the game as they would be in real life.  They can be knocked down, destroyed, or even broken apart.  Windows can be broken and the enemies know that crawling in like zombies in the previous games is only a waste of time.Capcom has taken out the fixed camera system (thank goodness) and replaced it with one that follows behind Leon making it easier to see things in front of you.  As mentioned earlier, the arsenal of this game is huge and the selection will make you want to buy all of them at once.  However you have to have enough room to place it in, just like the previous games, with a certain twist.  Items are as big as they would be in real life.  Don't have enough space for that shotgun, well then move your green herbs over.  That's right, you can actually manage your items in a much better fashion and even discard those that are not needed.  However, this is not RE0, once you drop an item its gone.  Ammo is not scarce in this game due to the huge change in action but if you are bad at aiming or managing it, you'll have trouble with swarms of people.  There's also a feature to upgrade your weapons to become extremely powerful.  My favorite is upgrading the handgun to have the strength of a shotgun.Another cool feature is the character you have to escort around.  Ashley, the president's daughter, will follow you around at a certain part of the game, but she's not stupid.  She'll duck when you aim in her direction, point out things to you if you hadn't caught them, scream when she gets abducted, and will hide when you tell her to.Capcom knows that one enemy type is not enough to please everybody so you'll run into real creepy things.  I will not spoil them because they are very cool to see and just writing it down would not be enough.  But, I will say one thing, these other creature will scare the crap out of you when you first see them.  The detail that went into each is amazing and none are reused from the other games.The storyline is great, the best in the series and its interesting to find out what has happened to the village.  The game follows 5 chapters and can be completed rather quickly.  However, I bought the game when it first came out and I still play it to this day.  There are many things that can be unlocked, which adds to the already replayability factor.Pick this game up, no matter what, you must have this game if you own a GC no questions asked.  There is nothing wrong with this game.  I do feel sorry for those PS2 owners though who will have to wait a little on this one because this is one of the best games that has ever been released, but if you can't wait, go out and buy a GC, they don't cost much and they don't take up much space.Pros- The best game ever made- Better Camera system- Best Storyline in all the games- Very Smart AI- No more zombies- Great Graphics- Great Sound- Awesome item system- Huge Arsenal- The ability to upgrade weapons- The unlockables add to the already great replay value- The escorting in the game is the best ever done in a game- The character you do escort is smart and reacts to situations well- We get to see Leon again after all these years","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2005"}

Since it includes the ps button alike the ps3 controller you can hold it and get the same options as on the controller, turn the remote or system off.#2 the remote doesn't drain your batteries more than any other bluetooth device, you can turn it off to save power as stated above - turning it on is as simple as pressing any button for 1-2 seconds.#3 the battery cover doesn't fall off as you claimed if operated with some common sense (i.e.: don't rub it against your pants, sofa etc) - it's pretty secure actually.#4 this remote is bluetooth people and not IR capable - why don't you do your research and find out what bluetooth and IR mean, the fact that they are totally different technologies, thus this will never be compatible with an IR receiver, no bluetooth device will actually be.#5 The remote doesn't turn on your ps3 by accident if common sense is also involved. People claimed that it turned on their PS3s when they sat on it on the couch. Well people, the same happens with your IR remote if you sit on it. Most remotes turn on the TV if a channel button or the on/off button is pressed. Also, be more careful/respectful with your stuff and handle it with care... this was not made to sit on it or hit it against the wall!!!The lack of illuminated buttons does not surprise me, not all remotes do. In fact few dedicated remotes do - this is not an universal remote!!!Also, button and text size are not too small either, if you don't see them get some glasses.The only gripe I have is that it doesn't give any feedback when it's in use (no LED nothing) but I can live with that. This remote complements the ps3 as a blu-ray player very well.Good job Sony! Also, you can't beat the price for $20.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"SirWilliam \"White Lake\"","summary":"Kingdom Hearts, One of the Best in All the Worlds","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts for the PlayStation 2 is on the top 50 games of all time list for any person that can enjoy any form of media.In Kingdom Hearts you play as Sora, a teenaged boy from Destiny Islands, where the world is soon taken over by darkness, brought upon by creatures called the Heartless, who are hearts that have been corrupted by darkness and taken over by it. In the game you team up with Donald Duck, the Court Wizard of King Mickey Mouse, and Goofy, Captain of the Royal Guard. While with them you travel and warp between several different different Disney Worlds, staving off the Heartless and trying to find Sora's best friends, Riku and Kairi.This game is what is called a \"hack-n-slash\" RPG. In an RPG such as this, you are continually pressing the attack button, but surprisingly that requires strategy. The battle system is flawless, but is slightly repetitive. However, the variation of abilities and enemis and battlefields and worlds completely negates that little problem.A compelling storyline to along with all this creates a game that will surprise and delight people of all ages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

Sometimes the game freezes so you have to restart the game all over again because you did not get to save. Like the newer one the quick battle is sort of fun but not as good as the newer one. I like to play it on multiplayer because it gives you someone to talk to and actually have a chance to beat. This would be a great game if the graphics were not so bad and if it was not as hard. Sorry for the negitive review but this game was not good for me because it was old and used and thats why it doesnt work so good, and it is pretty funny sometimes to hear and watch the glitches.....This game is also great online too and you can make a completly custom multiplayer game by yourself or with partners offline....Has a pretty good story mode, \"just ignore what i said above becasue i have not played the game around the time i made this review\" but a very hard storyline.

The XBox 360 launch release has great graphics - but a few flaws.Let's start with the great parts. We have a high definition TV and the graphics were just gorgeous. You can see the details of the face, the definition of the muscles, the details of the uniforms. The stadiums have signs in them promoting the home team.That being said, we noticed some issues with graphics right away. Some of the camera angles are just awful, and made it really hard to connect a player with a ball. The fans in the stand look like robots. Also, with the incredible detail they put into the character models, some simply aren't right.I'm happy to deal with even mediocre graphics if the gameplay is stellar. After all, it's the gameplay that keeps you going for months and months. We ran into problems here, too, though. The XBox 360 console crashed only halfway through our first game - and that was only the beginning.You can't challenge plays, either, even though some seem mighty suspect.There might be some players who really like the changes, and who can deal with the crashes and bugs. If you think that might be you, then certainly rent it for a week and see. After a week you should be able to tell how well you enjoy it and if you want to buy it.

{"product_name":"B0053BCO00","description":"The newest installment of the fan-favorite Mario Kart franchise brings Mushroom Kingdom racing fun into glorious 3D. For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging to the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"Nintendo finally crossed the line","reviewText":"Mariokart Wii was a great game but most players agreed that it had terrible item balancing; in an effort to allow casual gamers to compete, the game featured overpowered items that would allow poor players to take the lead regardless of how badly they were racing. Chief among them was the blue shell, which would constantly hit the 1st place player and stop him dead in his tracks several times each race. Many players complained that the heavy item balancing diminished the role of skill in races and often made it impossible for good players to win.Rather than toning it down for 7, Nintendo went the opposite direction and made the item balancing even more extreme. The blue shell still appears up to three or four times a race, but now it hits anyone on the track on the way to 1st, making it even more damaging to lead players.  Most Wii items like the bullet bill return alongside classic items like red shells and lightning bolts, and all of them seem to appear much more frequently than before. Even the humble green shells seem to be firing around the tracks at a level not seen before.The overabundance of items pairs with several other factors to make Mariokart 7 the most frustrating game in the series- for one, the SNES mechanic of increasing your top speed with coins returns, and while collecting coins is a lot of fun in itself, it makes the impact of items more extreme since you lose coins each time you are hit. Coins are needed to unlock customizations for your cart, and you only keep the coins you have in stock when you finish the race.  So in addition to halting your momentum and forcing you to re-accelerate, getting hit now diminishes your top speed and prevents you from receiving upgrades.The addition of air gliding segments also makes the impact of items harsher, since getting hit by any item in midair immediately sends you plummeting off the track to be fished up by Lakuti. Lightning bolts strike two or three times a match and if one strikes while you're gliding across a canyon you can kiss your odds of winning goodbye. Gliding itself feels good but doesn't necessarily add anything in particular to the gameplay, and you may find yourself dreading the sight of glide ramps due to the extreme vulnerability of being in the air.The courses are excellent and well varied, and the 3D effect is utilized extremely well with rain, snow, and other depth effects adding a lot of charm to the visuals. The tracks are more difficult than in most Mariokarts, with more obstacles and difficult corners to handle.  While the increased challenge is a welcome addition, the constant bombardment of items makes it hard to enjoy the tracks unless you race in time trials; there is nothing more aggravating than a bolt or shell causing you to fly off the track in the middle of an already difficult segment that's demanding all of your attention.The biggest evolution of gameplay from Mariokart Wii is the ability to customize your kart with unlockable items, which is a rewarding but slightly disappointing system since the impact of individual parts had to be limited to prevent overpowered combinations from occurring.  While there are technically more choices in your vehicle than ever before, none of the karts handle much differently than the standard kart, making the actual range of difference between one kart and another more narrow than MK Wii. It can be difficult to see any definite performance difference between some parts, and most gliders are just cosmetic options with identical stats.The online modes run well and are very fully featured, making it easy to add and race with friends or create communities with specific rules.  However, there is one glaring flaw online, and that is Maka Wuhu. This track has a glitch that can be exploited to jump 30 seconds ahead in the race, and it is impossible to catch up to the cheaters who use it without cheating yourself.At least one loser votes for Maka Wuhu in every lobby because of this exploit and the game ALWAYS seems to select it when it's present. There's no way to back out other than shutting the game off once the voting ends, so you either have to end your session early each time Maka Wuhu is selected or end up racing it 10 times every time you go online.Mariokart 7 is basically Mariokart Wii with great new tracks, a few shallow gameplay alterations, and even more frustrating item spamming. The game has amazing visuals and course design (aside from Maka Wuhu), good controls, and makes excellent use of the 3DS' abilities, but the lack of any deep innovations and the incredibly annoying items makes it difficult to enjoy these qualities as much as they deserve. If you loved Mariokart Wii regardless of the cheap AI and unfair items then you'll love Mariokart 7 as well, but if you were fed up with those faults last time around you'd probably be better off waiting for the next Mariokart title (assuming Nintendo doesn't continue the trend and add a giant, never ending lightning bolt that shoots blue shells and bees at every player throughout the entirety of every race).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

You can breeze through a lot of the levels without much trouble. But honestly it's such a fun game that that might not matter to you. Younger players (around age 6) will find it really fun. The graphics are nice and colorful. Just about everything is given a cute aesthetic to make things attractive.The story is very simple. The inhabitants of Dream Land live happy, perfect lives and sleep good and have awesome dreams. But this is no easy feat without the Star Rod which brings such great peace to everyone. One day King Dedede comes to Dream Land and bathes in the Fountain of Dreams. He then decides to take the Star Rod, breaking it into 7 pieces. Predictably, Kirby has to go through 7(?) worlds to retrieve them. The story is not award-winning but what Kirby game gives an enriched story? (:The gameplay is pretty simple too. Kirby can jump, fly, do a slide kick and inhale enemies without powers. If he inhales specific enemies with powers he will take them as his own and attack at will (with the button \"B\"). If you are hit by an enemy though a star pops out of you which contains said power up. If you still desire that power you must retrieve it quickly for it WILL disappear rather shortly. **NOTE**: If you want to get rid of an ability that you have just press Select and Kirby will purge the power. I was trying to press every button to figure this out but finally just looked in the book.If you've played a Kirby game where he can inhale enemies and steal their abilities then there isn't that much here that won't be of second nature to you. There are things like mini-games and multi-player things to do so your friends can join in on the fun too.Overall, this game is definitely worth getting. The graphics (although simple) are pleasant to look at, the music is generally catchy pop-y type stuff that will be stuck in your head and the controls are VERY simple. This game is generally for beginners in video games but it's still pretty accessible to anyone.My first review of July!

The first time I reviewed the game I was admittedly very harsh and perhaps over-critical. I only had the game for a day at that point and hadn't really explored many of the features. Now that I've had time to really digest the game I urge those who were nay sayers to take a closer look at the game. One of the first aspects of the game I initially slammed was its skimpy roster. Even though Goldberg and Stone Cold have recently left the WWE, to make a game without them is just bad. However with the improved create-a-wrestler and much more user friendly experience system, the task of creating these (and any other wrestlers you want) is exceedingly simple. Some new additions include the ability to have different attire for matches, entrances and cut scenes and the ability to buy experience points from the Shopzone. This is a huge improvement over HCTP because you had to take every created wrestler through season mode to beef up their stats.Another easy target for criticism was the much anticipated online mode. I have played this mode several times (with a broadband connection) and must admit there is a lot of room for improvement. I experienced horrible lag in some matches. HOWEVER, the very fact that you can take a created wrestlers online is an INCREDDIBLE!! Some of the wrestlers I encountered spoke volumes for the creativity of fans :smiles::The new additions to the game (minigames, face vs. heel tactics) bring the game much closer to the feel of an actual wrestling match. Some fans were upset with the disposable nature of the weapons (weapons disappear after several uses) but the power of the weapons has been increased compensate. Finally the graphic models look closer to their real life counterparts then ever before, the sets are beautiful and the voiceovers (though terrible at times) at a new dimension of realism to the game experience.Overall this newest installment of the Smackdown series has made a lot of new advancements (even if some of them need some work).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2004"}

Nero sees Dante, the hero of the previous games, kill the holy leader of their order in the middle of a crowded sermon. After fighting Dante - the story's introductory battle, which ends in Dante leaving with a smart remark - Nero must protect the city from the incursion of demons that have overrun it. The mystery of the occurrences and the truth behind Dante's purpose runs deeper as the story progresses.As mentioned, the main character is Nero, not Dante. However, for the most part, Nero is similar to Dante and Vergil - a white haired pretty-boy in a long coat with a sword and a gun. Nero has three main weapons - his sword, the Red Queen, his dual-barrel revolver, the Blue Rose, and his glowing demonic arm, the Devil Bringer. Each has its own purposes and abilities. The Red Queen is used for most of the game's combat. Besides combo attacks and the like, it can also be \"revved up\" like an engine (the sword's hilt resembles a motorcycle's handle) to increase its damage. The Blue Rose isn't as damaging as either of the other two weapons, but can be used to wear down enemies - particularly bosses - from a distance. The Devil Bringer is used for throws, but also functions as a grappling hook for use in certain areas and against large enemies. Fans of Dante need not fear, as he is playable as well in parts of the game, using the weapons and styles he possessed in previous games.DMC4 has a lot of callbacks to old games - moreso than the others do, anyways. The presence of the female leads from DMC 1 and 3 ties connections to those games (the other ones simply acted like they weren't there, similar to Bond Girls) and the introduction of the almost hilariously sexualized Gloria adds a new face to the series. Despite the difference in character styles, Nero and Dante play fairly similar apart from a few differences. This makes Nero familiar to fans of Dante, and Dante familiar to people who have played only this game and played Nero. Finally, the difficulty options are classified as \"Normal\" and \"Devil Hunter\", the latter being for people who have played the previous games and are used to the difficulty level established by it.The graphics are phenomenal in this game, especially in the cutscenes - this actually leads to some parts where the in-game fighting seems drastically overshadowed by the cutscene fighting. As a whole, the game is very nice to look at, with plenty of cool effects to add to the stylish combat system that DMC loves. The sound is pretty good, with a rock-and-roll soundtrack during fight scenes, but it's nothing particularly exceptional. On another technical note, while the installation on the PS3 version does take 20 minutes at the beginning, I noticed almost no loading time during the rest of the game - the entire thing was smooth and seamless.The gameplay, style, and graphics in this game are all fantastic. Capcom definitely knows what people want from a DMC game, and 4 delivers. The only mitigating factor is, even with the \"normal\" difficulty level, DMC4 can still get insanely hard at times (outside of combat as well as in it). But, as a whole, DMC4 is a solid package with a lot to love, and if you're willing to invest the time and effort it's worth it.9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Many I have tried are also open world (sandbox) games but this really doesn't fit into that category. I've only played 3 chapters so far and I like the direction of the story. There are some unique concepts introduced in this game that I have never experienced and that includes the \"0 G\" element of having no gravity, and the 3D HUD that you pull up to help you navigate through the ship. While I like the game overall my biggest issue is the controls. The Booklet does not do a great job of explaining the controls and it seems you always have to be holding the left trigger down for many actions (XBox 360) ..... whether it's reloading, floating to a surface, etc ..... Perhaps the COD's, Halo's, GTA's and other games have spoiled me a bit. A tap of the button is all you should really need to do for an ammo re-load.One minus is the lack of color in the game. I realize they want it to be dark and scary, but I haven't found myself scared, but rather more jumpy at some of the surprises. I just save often as I progress so I can redo from certain points. The HUD is probably my biggest issue with the game. While a 3D HUD can be pulled up and you can view the path you must take to get to your objective, it clutters the screen and does not stop the action (maybe I'm missing something here). I prefer a mini-map HUD or being able to plot a waypoint so you can navigate \"freely\". Overall this a good game with a story that draws you in, but its the controls that hold it back in my opinion. I bought this game along with Crackdown and so far I prefer Crackdown better and its an older release. I tend to prefer games that are fun so to be fair I'm a little bias there.If you're a fan of Sci-Fi or Horror I would recommend giving it a shot.On a shipping note, I bought this game and Crackdown (2007) together for a great price + free shipping. It was packaged in one shipment and I recieved the items quickly. One of those starnge instances where the cheaper game (of the 2) I prefer much more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

Every little detail has been carefully thought out and well put together. The user interface is new, fresh and different. It sort of has an online \"open lobby\" feel where you drive around this circle in the center of the city called \"ModSpot\". From there you can enter various stops outside the city in which you can enter a \"customization\" shop, racing, see top karts showcased and even watch updates on the big screen in the middle of the city (like Times Square in NYC.) Racing options include a single player \"career\" mode with unlocks, online XP modes, casual races and the like.However, the best part of this game is the customization. You can virtually customize every aspect of the game. Your Mod (your character) has unlimited creation options including clothing, hair style, colors and even the voice. You can have more than one and even download others from the online directory created by other users. You can even download creations made by your friends if you'd like. The same goes for karts, TONS of options. I am currently riding around in a shiny black SUV and \"racing green\", tricked out 1950's roadster. It lets you pick engines, wheels, body style, paint options (even including how glossy you'd like the paint) and everything else imaginable. And by far the best part of the game, track creation. You got it, create your own tracks, download creations made by others, download your friends tracks. This is a total game change and allows ModNation to not only plow over other kart racers but other racing games in general.Overall, this game is not only a solid buy but a must have for any PS3 fan. I honestly believe this game has a serious shot of taking game of the year. It's been said that ModNation is sort of like \"LittleBigPlanet+Mario Kart\". Although that's somewhat true given that it's a kart racer with lots of customization and level creation but to compare it to Mario Kart is a complete insult. This game is outstanding!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Good Game but Nothing New","reviewText":"I did everything possible in this game and its the first game I platinumed but that doens't mean I love this game. It is good but not great. It doesn't make the big leap that Uncharted did with its sequel but this game wanted to do just that. There is set pieces in this game that tries to do similar things but falls short with a less interesting story and slow progression. The game lets you do most of everything as the first one. In this game though you will be able to gain new abilities but I never felt too compelled to use them. I was fine with using my lighting abilities throughout the game.If your a big fan of the last game than I do recommend getting this game. It does look better. You can see everything has finer details, things look sharper, and there is more varied enemies. This game has for instance three fractions and each of these fractions fight you. One using ice and you will gain their abilities at one point in the game and they have big ice soldiers, your first encounter being a boss. They are nice but actually too easy to beat. The game never felt too challenging.This game has one major thing going for it that I like and this being able to make your own levels and share them with others like LittleBIGPlanet. The game allows you not just to put enemy placements but also tell the story through dialogue. Its a nice addition and anytime you can jump into one of these missions. There is even some people that make platforming missions or even missions where you have to throw a car at some enemies like a bowling. Its very flexible in its creativity.The last thing I will mention is new DLC coming out for the game this October. It is titled Festival of Blood and Cole has been bitten by Vampires that have overridden New Marais (where the game takes place) and to save yourself you have to find the one that bitten you. Its sound pretty amazing and something to look forward to later on. I know I am :)Anyway, the game is good. It just doesn't do a lot of new things outside the level creator which is still a nice addition. If you like action titles, open world games, than I can somewhat recommend it. Just don't expect a lot of gameplay changes from the last games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2011"}

I saw no need to add to the \"ALSO, I LIKED IT, TOO, AS WELL\" crowd without any negative comments worth mentioning.The same dealy applies to Fallout 3, yet because of the sheer size and scope of it compared to Oblivion, I can be bothered to put both positives and negatives together into a decent enough review.For note, I have never played any of the previous Fallout games, and showed no interest in them prior to this.Also, I'll be dropping the name \"Yahtzee\" a bit, referring to video game reviewer Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw and his video reviews for The Escapist magazine.Positive:-The world is indeed tremendous, and compared to Oblivion, which to Yahtzee was merely a square mile of English countryside multiplied again and again with wolves and bandits added, this world is simply a gaping epic story in itself to look at.  Ten hours into the game, I still can't get over stopping and staring at the horizon, and knowing that This is the way Washington D.C., has looked for two hundred years!  Being a historian, this trapped me in a quantam vortex of awesome and pee-pants.-The V.A.T.S. targeting system, which has slow-motion angle shots for combat scenes.  While Yahtzee mentioned that it looked \"groovy pants\", he also pointed out that because it's basically the same thing every time you use it, it would gradually just become \"pants\".  For me at least, it hasn't yet become pants, after ten hours of play.-Realistic gore!  The M rating is put to use here, in the form of excessive violence.  While nowhere near the sort of explicit body explosions of something like \"Rambo\", I never get tired of seeing a point-blank gunshot to someone's head have a chance of blowing their head up in a mess of blood, bone, and mushy meat fragments.  Nor do I tire of crippling someone's arm and seeing their gun fly out of their hand, or firing at someone's limb enough times to dismember them, or to sever their head from their body by utterly destroying their neck with bullets.-Insanely top-notch graphics for a game of this sheer size.-Play as male or female, with dialogue options altering to fit your gender (ie, you'll get compliments as to how much you look like your mother if you're female, or how beautiful you are, or how much of a bitch you are for trying to steal from them).-Genuinely interesting story that pans itself out gradually.-Interactive people all around, including Ghouls who are nice to you (there's even an implied lesbian Ghoul couple who run a hotel in the Underworld)I'm sure there's plenty more great things to be said, but I can't think of any major ones to speak of and so I'll have to move on to the bad.Negatives:-I can't vouch for male characters just yet, but the customizable options for females is an utter mess.  Faces are disgusting lumps of blotchy, rugged, seemingly acne-scarred messes (which considering that the character isn't raised in the Wasteland, but rather in the highly clean and stable environment of Vault 101, is a curiosity), and for some odd reason, every pre-set and color option always ends up with the same result---the women have 5 o'clock shadow on their upper lip, and around their chins.None of the other in-game women suffer from these sort of options, managing to look like actual women, whereas your character is forced to look like a pre-op transsexual without a long, long time spent into wrestling with dials and sliders which, like Oblivion, are connected to one another, making it hell to mold the flesh with one slider without every other slider moving on its own to screw up your changes.-The game is an action/adventure RPG, but it's still an RPG, so damage both taken and delivered tends to border on the ridiculous, as in one scene I had a pistol and used the V.A.T.S. system to put three bullets into a human opponent's head, and not only did they not die, but they were still standing, and continued to beat me half to death with a baseball bat until I had to punch them to kill them dead.-Occasional game freezes.-The instant-transport system from Oblivion is back, which has both good and bad implications in that you can easily move back and forth from places without spending hours wandering around the ruins, but it's done without any consequence to time or health or fatigue anything in between, so you can just teleport from place to place as much as you want as quickly as your game will load.-As Yahtzee mentioned as the biggest problem with Oblivion's immersion failure, there is a limited number of voice actors for the Ghouls.  I can thankfully say that unlike Oblivion, not everyone has the same two voice actors, but with the Ghouls in particular, there are quite literally only two voice actors, one male and one female, and they don't even bother changing up their voices when playing the Ghouls.  As such, every Ghoul you speak to of a certain gender will sound exactly like one another.-There are some audio tapes/files in the \"Notes\" section of your Pip-Boy (such as your father's personal diary entries and such) which are almost completely inaudible due to the low sound mixed with the poor recording quality.  It's only by sheer luck, determination, strain, and high volume, that I've managed to understand half of what is said in these diary entries.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47JE","reviewerName":"PT Cruiser","summary":"Get up off the couch and Wii!","reviewText":"Wii Fit Plus, that is!  I couldn't wait to try this new title because I enjoy and use the first one so much. When you start it up, the Plus goes and gets all your info and stats from the older version and brings them right into the game, so you can continue right where you left off, but with lots of new games and features.  This is well worth the $20 just for the 15 new games.There are lots of nice new features with this Wii Fit Plus.  I always wished I could set up routines instead of having to move from one menu to the next after each exercise, or that there were ready made routines that I could follow involving several exercises.  With the Plus this is possible.  You start in the locker room and select from Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, or the Favorites menu.  You go to another screen to decide what parts of your body or what type of goals you want to pursue and the difficulty level and length of time.  Then the system will set up a routine designed just for you and your goals.  I think it's much more efficient to go through exercises this way.  You can also compare how you did each day and how much you're improving.  There's a multiplayer mode so that more than one person can play, but you do have to take turns.  Still, it's nice to not have to 'log out' each time a different person wants to play.Another new feature is that you can add babies or pets to the Plus.  I have a big fat long haired 'mini' dachshund that was too embarrassed to be weighed today, but that pupper is going to get weighed tomorrow!  They don't get to do body tests or play any games, but you can keep track of their weight and record it in their stats.  Useful?  Well, maybe not so much but big points for the cuteness factor.I love the games because it's such a great way to get exercise without even realizing it and the 15 new ones in this title are just as good as the old if not better than the first edition.  Want to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time?  One of these games will have you balancing on a big red and white striped ball (your Wii Fit board) while juggling smaller balls thrown to you by your assistants.  Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music?  Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails.  It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge.  I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to \"pop\" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole.  You control their movement by leaning in different directions on the balance board.There are also 3 new yoga activities and 3 new strength training activities.  That's not to say that some of the games don't improve strength and muscles.  There is one game where you flap your arms like wings to fly from one target post to another over water to get points on each one.  This is one where you want to draw all the curtains because you'll look completely ridiculous standing there on your balance board wildly flapping your arms like some kind of a crazy bird.  But you won't believe how tired your arm muscles feel afterward and you don't even notice while you're busy flying from one target to another.  There's another game, Island Cycling, where you step on the balance board to simulate pedaling a bike, trying to pass Wii flags where you accumulate points.  You steer with the Wiimote held sideways.  I was surprised how sore my calves were afterward, trying to control the speed of the bike.When you can get exercise while doing something that's challenging and fun without even realizing that you're exercising, that's a successful game.  That's why I bought the Wii to begin with and this game takes full advantage of the balance board and all the interactive features.  Can I walk and chew gum at the same time after playing these games?  Well, maybe not yet but I can bust big blue and white balloons by running into them with my Segway on a beach and get almost halfway through the course inside a big ol' bubble in Balance Bubble Plus.

{"product_name":"B004J6I0YO","description":"","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Solid Trilogy.  Hi-Def Treatment A Mixed Bag.","reviewText":"I'm gonna level with you: This review will probably be a little tough to follow.  Why?  Because I both love and hate this trilogy of games, and I have even stronger feelings about this HD re-release.  So let me give you a quick background:* I believe \"The Sands of Time\" is a good game, but was badly overrated with all of its Editor's Choice, 9s and 10s, and Game-of-the-Year consideration back in 2003.  It was always worth a gamer's time, but it was no masterpiece.* \"Warrior Within\" is easily the most divisive game of this trilogy, and rightfully so.  I don't hate the game, but I have some very strong criticisms of it.* I actually think \"The Two Thrones\" is the best game of this collection, because it took the best aspects of the previous 2 games, and also innovated on the formula.It's hard to know where to begin with this review.  I'll get into some technical details, and then explore each individual game, and see where we end up.TECHNICAL STUFFAll three games have been allegedly remastered.  I say \"allegedly\" because I don't consider this an upgrade.  \"The Sands of Time\" has some serious sound issues, where the dialogue is almost impossible to hear and sound effects feel misplaced.  There are echoes when the characters are outdoors, and the sounds of swords clashing are 100 times louder than the music.  I never had a problem with the hard rock music from \"Warrior Within\", but those annoying shrieks of your enemies haven't aged well.  In any event, the music is also very difficult to hear, as can be the dialogue in certain sections.  Thankfully, \"The Two Thrones\" has a perfect balance with all of its sound aspects.  The music, dialogue, background, and other effects are tuned properly and don't require any adjustments with your sound system or settings.  But it's a real shame that \"The Sands of Time\" and \"Warrior Within\" have such shockingly awful sound quality, where the way my camera is aimed can determine whether I get a crisp clear sound or a soft whisper.  And no...it's not my TV or system, because none of my other games or consoles have this problem.It is true that all 3 games have had the graphics redone, but I am not convinced this is for the better.  What I found more often than not is that while the environments have better textures, the buildings and architecture feel more fake now.  \"The Sands of Time\" and \"The Two Thrones\" don't have this problem too much, but the Fortress in \"Warrior Within\" can look very unconvincing in certain areas (especially that long staircase where the Prince enters for the first time).  The character models look a little more fake too, with \"Warrior Within\" showing some seriously baffling issues (the Prince has a different skin complexion on the right side of his mouth).  The pre-rendered cutscenes have always looked good, and they hold up today.Loading times haven't improved, but they were fine to begin with.  I've read that some gamers experienced some serious glitches with \"Warrior Within\" back in 2004 when it was first released, but I never encountered those problems even back in the day, so I couldn't say.I haven't tested the 3D feature yet, but I'm honestly not interested.  I haven't bought into the 3D gimmick yet, having tested it with a few movies and games.Oh, I know this isn't a huge deal, but this Trilogy has some of the dumbest Trophies I've ever seen.  \"The Sands of Time\" has one for playing over 10 hours, when a new gamer can finish it in 7 hours.  Why do I get a trophy for completing the defense mechanism puzzle but not the torturous library sequence?  Why is there a trophy for using my Rewind ability less than 20 times in 1 game, yet I'll get a trophy if I use it over 200 times?  \"Warrior Within\" gives me a trophy just for landing on the island at the end of the first sequence, but not another story-related trophy until I destroy a random giant boss about 75% of the way through (even though I've killed 2 similar giants earlier).  \"The Two Thrones\" trophies are a little more reasonable, involving the number of enemies killed using stealth, or the number of enemies killed as Dark Prince, but there are still a scant number of story-related ones.  And why are the trophies for these games mostly Silver or Gold level?  And why doesn't \"The Sands of Time\" have a trophy for not dying when the 2 sequels do?  Man, I'm think too deep into this.I guess when it comes to this PS3 collection, I recommend trying to find the original 2003-2005 discs instead.  They honestly look and sound better, in my opinion.  Games this old won't ever look as sharp as what gets released today, so why try to convince anybody otherwise?THE TRILOGY\"The Sands of Time\" is indeed a true pioneer in action and platforming.  The combat is fluid and unique, and the death-defying and escapes the Prince endures are always exhilerating.  Where I think \"Sands of Time\" needs to be put in its place is the story.  The concept itself is very good, with a Prince using a powerful dagger with time-altering abilities to reseal a deadly magic.  And there are some very compelling story moments, especially in the final hour or so of the game.  But the fact of the matter is that between say the 20%-80% mark, this story goes absolutely nowhere.  The Vizier (main villain) is nowhere in sight.  The confrontation with the Prince's father isn't nearly as dramatic as it needs to be.  I don't expect long, drawn-out sequences.  But as I think I can show with \"The Two Thrones\", there is a way to merge this exciting gameplay style with a good story in small doses.  \"The Sands of Time\" has always been a strong game, but I don't think it's ever been a great one.\"Warrior Within\" is like the prequel trilogy of \"Star Wars\".  It's the one game that \"Prince of Persia\" fans like to make fun of, even though there are plenty of fans who like it.  This 2nd chapter has some fundamentally strong attributes that its haters forget to address.  In fact, I think I love what most people hate about \"Warrior Within\", and hate what most critics praised about it.  I love the hard-edge rock music.  I love the darker color palette and more disturbing enemies.  I love the way this game makes the Prince self-centered without being an annoying smart aleck.  I love the expanded combat engine, with dual weapons and bloodier results.  What drives me bonkers with \"Warrior Within\" is that it involves a ton of backtracking between two timelines, and frankly, it's a confusing mess.  The map feature is almost useless, and there aren't enough clues to tell you whether you're heading the right way or not.  Exploration is one thing, but \"The Sands of Time\" and \"The Two Thrones\" were wise to keep things linear with a few secrets to discover.  \"Warrior Within\", on the other hand, is such a jigsaw puzzle that getting the good ending isn't even likely without a strategy guide.  Get this, there are 2 endings, and the slightly-happier one isn't reachable unless you find all the hidden health upgrades.  I wouldn't mind this conundrum if \"The Two Thrones\" didn't begin with the happier ending, but it does!  I guess my big beef with \"Warrior Within\" is that I was willing to appreciate all of the risks it took with its style and story, but I feel like my favorite aspect of \"Prince of Persia\" --- the platforming and exploration --- got turned into a backtracking chore.  \"Warrior Within\" is a solid game, but it's sure to test your patience, for one reason or another.\"The Two Thrones\", in my opinion, is the pinnacle of this trilogy.  The story is constantly in focus, with the player always feeling like something is developing.  The combat is just as tight as it was in \"Sands\" and \"Warrior\".  The Prince character is rightfully returned to the persona that he was in \"Sands of Time\", though mature enough to sympathize with him.  The platforming is as tight as ever, with more tricks and obstacles to discover.  The gameplay mechanics are changed up a bit, with a few chariot sequences and the option of attempting stealth Speed Kills.  Players will also get to use The Dark Prince from time to time, almost like a brand new character to experiment with.  I especially love the lush outdoor scenery of Babylon.  Indoor exploration is fine, but navigating the rooftops and streets was often a pleasure.  My big gripe about this chapter, however, is the villain.  I won't give away anything, but frankly, the villain undergoes a drastic transformation almost immediately, and it's frankly very silly looking.  The whole time instead of awaiting my deadly nemesis, I kept thinking, 'This punk looks like an annoying boss battle waiting to happen.'  But the psychological torment going on in the Prince's mind more than makes up for that issue.  I always enjoyed listening to the narrator's telling of the story, and the Prince's mad inner discussions.  I don't know if I'll play \"The Two Thrones\" (or any of these games) very often, but it's a hell of a first-time playthrough.OVERALLShould I give this disc 5 stars because it's exactly what \"Prince of Persia\" fans are asking for with a great price?  Should I give this 3 stars because of all the repetition and technical inconsistencies?  I giving this 4 stars because even though I'd rather play the original PS2/GameCube/X-Box versions, this is a solid collection of games in one place.\"The Sands of Time\" - 8.25 / 10\"Warrior Within\" - 7.75 / 10\"The Two Thrones\" - 8.75 / 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"A kinder, gentler Oddysee","reviewText":"The original Oddworld game, Abe's Oddysee, was pretty challenging. (I never got around to playing Abe's Exxodus.) It was definitely a thinking man's game. It appeared to be a platformer, but in truth it was a puzzle game through and through. The controls and character animations were not geared towards true platforming action. It was about figuring out what precise series of steps you had to take to reach areas, and how to guide/help/manipulate NPC characters to reach areas. For the most part, Munch's Oddysee is the same sort of game. [Arbitrary edit by one of Amazon's faceless editors.] I never encountered any puzzle that was as tough to crack as the toughest puzzles in Abe's Oddysee. I don't object to the few levels in which you send a squad of allies to attack enemies. When you spend so much time in the game sneaking around and fearing for your life, turning the tables on the bad guys once in a while feels great. One thing that hurts the challenge level is that you can literally save anywhere. ANYWHERE. In the original, if you had to run a long gaunlet of several tough manuvers, you just had to keep trying over and over until you were able to perform them all in one go. In this game, if you're faced with a series of 20 demanding jumps, you can make the first jump, save, make the second jump, save etc. If you miss the final jump, rather than have to start back at the beginning, you can just reload your last \"quicksave\" and try that final jump until you get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2002"}

{"product_name":"B006WQR3V0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Fun and addictive turn based strategy / business sim?","reviewText":"The story is simple to this game. Aliens are invading and you are the commander of a secret group / army that must save humanity. The game is dual sided. At its core, this is a turn based tactical strategy where there is a game grid. You select your troops and send them off. Your troops on the game map have two part moves. You can either spend each troop's on movement or one move and one attack. You cannot attack twice (without abilities) and once you attack, that's the turn for that troop. Each troop / soldier starts out as a standard grunt with no abilities. You give them armor, a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and a misc item like a grenade, med kit, stun gun or body armor. Once they get a promotion (level up), they take on a specific job, such as a sniper, heavy weapons, support, assault and so on. Each promotion gives them a new ability that you can chose. The whole selection process and soldier loadout is done very simple. There are no overwhelming choices of 30 armors. At the most you might get a few for each category. Very simple, very quick and if you want you can customize your soldiers.Back to the strategy game. Cover is your friend, you want to have cover between chess pieces and the alien chess pieces. Keep in mind since this is a strategy game, you see an almost overhead view. Sometimes when your soldiers are running to cover you will see an OTS perspective and when you take aim, you see the active soldier's perspective. That doesn't mean you have control of the aim of course. Every attack gets a percentage that you'll actually hit them. If there is no cover and close range the hit percentage is 90%+. If enemies are out of range or covered, that percentage turns into 60% or less. Flanking is important and the enemy will flank you if not destroy the cover.When you start getting better weapons and armor, the game will beef up its enemies as well. You'll never be coasting by for too long. Once the difficulty starts ramping up, you'll find yourself unable to use common tactics like flanking, because when you flank on deeper missions, you risk waking up more enemies to join the battle.The battles have different elements to them like if a soldier is critically injured (but not dead yet), they will bleed out and die within 3 rounds if not stabilized. Even if they're stabilized, that doesn't mean they're back in the fight. They just lie there and if you complete the mission, then you get them back. So a few battles will leave someone critically injured and you need to decide to bring a soldier with a med kit to stabilize them and risk having that person die in the process or do you clear out the enemy first and risk the person dying in the process or do you just let them die? Future upgrades make it so they can be revived to actively fight again and not just stabilized. It is a deep system that sets it apart from other games. It feels rewarding if you're able to pull it off.These missions seem pretty randomized. Sometimes you'll have to chose from 3 missions. Each mission will give you a major reward like money or engineers or a new soldier. So there's a lot to consider when selecting a mission. The game will even warn you about the difficulty of the mission as well.The other half of the game is the simulation of running your own agency and army. It is broken up into different divisions, like research, engineering, barracks, hanger and the war room. When you win matches and battles in the game you collect things to research. You assign what they should research and that will enable more things to make and buy like better armor, laser weapons and so on. Then with the engineering, that is where you buy and make the things. You also can see your facility and add other sections to your facility such as power plants, laboratories, satelite uplinks and so on. The barracks is where you update, hire soldiers and view dead soldiers. You can also do it before the missions begin so visiting the barracks isn't always a top priority. The soldiers are all randomly generated, which is awesome. You can modify their looks and info if you want to get into that.Next up is the hanger, I should explain that you have satellites and can launch others. This gives you a first response to alien invasions. You will send up a fighter jet to take out the space ships. You do not control the fight.... you just watch it. The hanger is where you upgrade these air defenses. You will have hangers in every continent of the globe. So if all of your jets are in North America, there will be no air defense for Australia. And if you chose not to scramble a jet, then the aliens will come back later and destroy your satellites. You can upgrade to stealth satellites too. The final division contains finances where you can sell junk that you obtained from winning battles. More importantly you can see the globe's panic level. Every major country has a panic level. The higher the panic level, the less they'll pay your shadow corp. Basically its like a chart showing you how well you're doing and how much of the planet has been taken over.Seeing where you are in the world's conquest means that if you lose a mission, you haven't lost. You won't redo the mission over and over until you beat it. When you lose, you lose. It is one battle in a war. I think that's one of the perks to the game, you have loss and you just have to accept it.If you let a country slip and they get worse and worse, that means when you have a mission in that country it will be more difficult. And difficulty in this game is something to take note of. The game will warn you how difficult a mission is. I should also point out that if a soldier is killed in action, that's it for the soldier, they are no longer with you. You'll feel every death. You see your soldiers grow, you've customized their look, if not rename them so when they die, you feel it. Those are the hours you had them on your team and now they're dead. With other games it doesn't matter that much, but with this game you feel the impact. When your soldiers are injured, they can't participate in missions, which is the perfect reason to train usually unused less experienced soldiers. Its a very nice process.The graphics are good, but not outstanding. Good atmosphere, lightning effects. There are little details that make it stand apart from other strategy games. The voice work is good as well. The game does a good job of feeding you information through voice overs. The soldiers have their own voices too.In all, the two major elements of turn based strategy coupled with a business sim mean that you'll never overdose and get bored. There's always a break between the action of missions and that drives you to keep going, because when you're done with a mission.... then you need to do research and engineer stuff, but when you're done with that... there's a new mission to get to! I can understand that this game isn't for everyone. This is a very high quality game that you can sink hours and days into. You won't have the exact same experience twice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2013"}

Even my wife enjoyed it.  I enjoy this game much better than Mario Party, because the AI doesn't cheat like MP.It is like an Olympic style game in which you compete in 3 different games for orbs.  After the 3 games are completed, you take your orbs to the final event for that area, in a game called fusion frenzy.  Before the fusion frenzy game starts you can either elect to play your orbs or trade some or all of them for points.  The goal of FF is to put orbs in goals scattered along the ground.  The only catch is you can only pick or orbs of your own color, or the neutral white color.  Meaning if you are the red player (Samson), no other player can pick up red orbs.  You can also pick up and score with many orbs at one time for even more points.  But watch out, other players can attack and take your orbs at anytime for themselves.  After completing all the areas, the player with the most points is declared the winner.There are 6 areas in this game all which have games that are relevant to that area.  You can elect to play through all 6 areas or just 2 or 4.  The six areas are Coliseum, Downtown, Outlands, Military Base, Power Station, and Waterfront.  The amount of orbs you get depend on how you place in each game.In total, there are 45 mini-games, not including the fusion frenzy matches.  While a couple of games are corny and outright boring, most are pretty fun with a few of my favorites being:BLAST MAN STANDNINGJET STREAMROLLER RUCKUSROLLMENTUMRUBBLE ALLIANCESUMOTANK TRACKSTWISTED SYSTEMWATER GATE SCRAMBLEThe graphics in this game are pretty basic, but that doesn't bother me one bit.  I'd take fun game play and OK graphics over superb graphics and terrible game play (i.e. PGR) any day.The sound in this game is pretty basic, but does seem to fit the game very well.  You can also import your own tracks if you like, but I think the music provided matches the game play sufficiently enough.My only gripe about this game is that you are limited to playing against the people in your room.  There is no XBOX live support, which definitely decreases the lasting appeal of this game greatly.  After playing hundreds of times with the same people you will eventually get tired of the game even though the CPU does fill in the two unoccupied human slots with AI controlled players.  XBOX Live would have increased the lasting appeal of this game infinitesimally because you will always have new people to play with.I would like to see a sequel keeping the same concept, but with possibly more characters and even more mini games.  Also even though I cancelled my subscription, I would also like to see a sequel have XBOX Live support.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2005"}

Such \"classics\" as Bart's Nightmare and Simpsons Skateboarding are just some of the games that are in the catalogue. So finally we have an actually good Simpsons game, if only for a few snafus.Story: It's hard to detail the story without giving so much away but basically there's something wrong with Springfield and it involves mysterious black vans and Buzz Cola and these flying bee cameras. It only gets nuttier from there.Graphics: It was strange looking at Bart and Homer in 3D from the Halloween episode so when everybody looks like that, it's even more strange. But it matches the show's tone with Springfield broken up into 3 sections.Sound/Music: You get the classic theme by Danny Elfman and other pieces of music that you might've heard from the show. The voice actors reprise all their roles which gives everything a feeling of authenticity and something familiar.Gameplay: Best way to describe it is kind of GTA-meets-Simpsons. Springfield is divided into 3 sections: first includes the Simpsons House, the Kwik-E-Mart, Springfield Elementary and the Old's Folks Home, the Trailer Court, the Rich/Poor area codes, Mr. Burns castle and the Nuclear Power Plant. 2nd area includes Krusty Burger, Moe's, the Arena, the Movie Theatre and City Hall. 3rd area includes Burns casino, Krusty Studios, Camp Krusty, the Duff Factory, and the Comic Book Store and Bowl-A-Rama.The player controls 5 characters(Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Apu) and they have story based missions. Also in the level is races, hidden vehicles by doing a secret mission, collector's cards like the hidden packages from GTA and the bee cameras.The story missions can be quite frustrating. One particular mission has you destroying close to 30 street stands then making it back to Krusty Studios within a small time limit and you barely get close to the Studios before your time runs out. The traffic doesn't help either or the rather shoddy steering. Another mission has you literally dashing from the Nuclear Power Plant to Springfield Elementary in at least a minute and it's quite a long ride.However, like a weird addiction, you just wanna keep going no matter how angry you get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2005"}

As an open world RPG, the style of gameplay by its very nature brings about polarizing opinions. However, the other element to such an expansive game is the opportunity for gameplay bugs, some of which potentially game breaking, to occur. So, with that in mind, I would say this is still an all timer in my opinion. There are definitely bugs in the game. I own all three versions and have found that my preference is for the 360 version. There just seems to be more tech support for this version than the others. However, PC has mods, which are pretty awesome. Sadly, although the PS3 is actually my preferred gaming choice, the PS3 version of this game doesnt feature the dedicated support offered for the other versions, and the bugs and glitches really tend to stand out. I have 70% achievements for the game on PS3 but cant finish due to a game breaker at Aldruins Wall that hasnt been fixed after more than a year of gamers reporting it. Anyway, point being, for this game, I think the optimal version is the 360 version. As an added bonus, the 360 version gets DLC before the other two (actually, PS3 has yet to receive Dawnguard or Hearthfire, which have now been on the market for several months now).Now, for the game itself. The graphics are pretty jaw dropping. The world is stunning visually, and really seems to be a living breathing world with vibrant colors, shapes, and sounds. The dungeons are pretty amazing, and often feature a nice looping design, wherein the exit point is always near the entrance, meaning you dont ever need to backtrack. Once you finally are able to delve beneath the dwarven ruins, you will find another piece of the world that will truly blow you away with its originality and beauty, mixed with the ever present sense of danger (Blackreach). Dragons...they are intense and awesome! I can really keep going on and on. This game can steal a few real time months of your life away from you if you let it. Hours can seem like minutes when you're playing.A couple other nice features: dual wield (weapon/shield, two weapons, weapon/spell, spell/shield, 2 spells, double strength spell), enhanced character design features, awesome death scenes, epic quests, interesting enhanced take on werewolf/vampire play with cool quest/story arcs, dragon shouts (which are amazing in their variety and power), dual main questlines (rather than having one main quest, there are essentially two primary storylines with of course 100's of other unrelated quests), a different and really cool way to level up and neat interface for that as well as your typical equip/journal/etc...pages...just to name a few things.This game truly is epic, and you really cant go wrong regardless of the format you choose, but personally, for this game, I recommend the 360 version.

A sequel to Red Dead Revolver, this is an open world gun-slinging game set in the Old West.Atmosphere: 10/10Red Dead Redemption features one of the best settings of an open world game.  Visually, the environments are stunning, but they're also living.  As you ride through the plains, you'll see coyotes hunting rabbits, wolves chasing deer, wild horses running free, buzzards circling the dead.  As you progress through the game, the world changes.  The railroad extends through the countryside and the towns grow.  You'll see more buildings, more people, advancements in technology, and clothing styles change with the times.  The characters also go about their daily business.  In the daytime, the shops are open and the citizens perform their daily routines, at night, the saloons are packed with drinkers, gamblers, and adulterers alike.  I'd say Red Dead's Atmosphere tops Assassin's Creed 2, Fallout 3, and Oblivion.Story: 9/10You are John Marsten, a bounty hunter hired by the government to bring your old gang to justice.  You need to deal with a cast of misfits and shady characters to accomplish your mission.  Aside from the main story, Red Dead also features some background dialogue and themes that really set the tone for the Old West.  There's also some interesting social commentary that relates to the USA of modern day.Graphics: 10/10Red Dead is a beautiful game.  From the sunsets, to the landscapes, to the towns, to the animals, and character designs, this game is visually amazing!!!Gameplay:  8/10Most of the game involves shooting enemies.  If you move the cursor close to an enemy, and hold the Left Trigger, the cursor will lock onto their bodies.  On Normal Mode, the cursor snapping is extremely generous, so the gameplay feels almost too easy for fans of shooters.  The game also features a resource based, Dead-Eye shooting mechanic which slows time and allows you to fire with pinpoint accuracy.  If you want more of a challenge, Red Dead has an Expert Targeting Option which makes the game much more difficult.One criticism about Red Dead is that the enemy types are very shallow.  Most of the enemies that you face are armed with a gun, they take cover, pop up, and shoot, then take cover again.  Some shoot at you while on horseback.  But they all feel too similar, and at times the action feels like a BB gun shooting gallery.This game really could have used more enemy types:  Enemies that throw dynamite with a 5 second fuse to get you to move away from cover, enemies that lasso you from horseback, stealthy tomahawk wielding \"Injuns\", would have all been welcome additions.Red Dead also features a bunch of mini-games:  Texas Hold'em, Blackjack, Arm-Wrestling, 5 Finger Fillet, Liar's Dice, and Horseshoes.  These are fun, but most of the games use the most convoluted, overly complicated, control schemes that I've seen.  Why does it take 4 buttons and 2 triggers to play Poker?!  Why do you need 2 camera angles, an analog stick, and some buttons to throw a horseshoe?!  As I played Horseshoes, I thought that it would be easier to hit an enemy submarine with a depth charge using a sonar at 100 meters, than get a ringer in this game.  Although the controls are overly complicated, you can learn them quickly.MissionsMost of the Missions are fun and feature interesting characters and witty dialogue.  They range from killing guys to killing more guys and then there are some where you kill even more guys.  There are also missions where you collect items, escort people, defend areas, assault trains, defend stagecoaches... usually while killing guys.Aside from the 57 story missions, there are also 25 Stranger Missions, Hunting Missions, Random Encounters, Treasure Hunting Missions, Sharpshooting Missions, and Gambling Missions.  Rockstar is still releasing Downloadable Content with even more Missions...Sound:  10/10From the ambient environment sounds, the classic western sountrack, to the gunfire, the sound really ads quite a bit to the already impressive atmosphere.Multiplayer:  9/10There are several different Multi-player Modes, too.  Capture the gold, Eliminate an Enemy Team, Free for All Shoot em up... etc.  As you play Multiplayer, you gain Experience which you can use to upgrade your character and get new horses, weapons, etc...  One good feature about Multiplayer is that if you are a Level 1 character, you can loot the corpse of a Level 50 character and use their guns.  This makes the Multiplayer Combat more about skill, than grinding to get better equipment!Replay Value:  10/10Although, the main story is linear, you can play as good or evil...  but the game rewards you much more for playing as good.  With a 40-100 hour Campaign, dozens of side missions, collectibles, multiplayer modes, etc...  You'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck.  There's about 200 hours of entertainment here.Maturity:  MRed Dead features sexual situations (but not sex), harsh language, drinking, and heaps of violence.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a regular day at High School if everyone wore Cowboy Hats.Overall:  9.7/10With an incredible atmosphere, fairly easy gameplay, excellent graphics, and a good story, Red Dead should satisfy anyone with a hankerin' for the old west.Buy it if you like the Old West.Buy it if you like Open World Games.Buy it if you like Rockstar Games.I can't recommend renting it, unless you have 50-70 hours to finish it.Avoid it if you don't like violence or foul language.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Nintendo Finatic","summary":"Pikmin is Great","reviewText":"Pikmin is a great game!

 they said that all the women in this game are naked, and after beating this game at 42 hours and one minute, i saw not one naked [...].  there might be one in the strip club, behind closed doors, but i never visited that place, i had too much fun riding through the mountains and evading cops in the desert.that's what these games are about, giving the player freedom to do what he/she can't do in real life.  or, they can, but it would be illegal.  if these stupid, un-educated MAVV women would open their eyes for once, they would see that if they keep shielding kids' eyes from violence, these poor children will just become another statistic.  because, they didn't know what gangs were, they didn't know not to wonder into dark alleys, they didn't know about the war and how it is changing our country, they didn't know the effect of violence and it's stupidity.  i remember, from being a kid, that whenever my mom would tell me i couldn't watch a movie, because it wasn't the type of movie for me, i would want to see that specific film more than anything.  and somehow i would always get my hands on it and watch it, and you know what, sure it was violent, but i'm not murdering people.  in fact, i've never killed anything in my life, there is nothing i hate more than real life violence.  and videogames are not real life violence, they are entertainment, just like movies and books, they put the same stuff in our heads as history books and films do, so why haven't kids been killing people since the dawn of literature? who knows, some people just aren't right in the head, and whether or not they play violent videogames shouldn't matter.  but of course the only people that will read this and see it for what it is are people that agree with me.  fellow gamers.but enough on how much i despise the MAVV, and onto the game.sorry about that.the replay value of this game is outrageous.  during your various missions, you come across a multitude of side-jobs.  including:  truck driver, vallet, delivery boy, car-exporter, gambler, pimp, figure-8 racer, mountain biker, pilot, tagger, gangster...i can't think of any more right now, but you get the idea.  and this game is freaking massive in size, especially when you're stuck in the middle of the desert with no vehicle and miles away from a road.  it's a long walk.  and now, a cool new feature, you can swim.  and it's pretty fun.  but one thing i noticed is that earlier on in the game, before you unlock the rest of the map/cities and areas, if you swim across the river to the next town before you are supposed to, you are automatically hit with a 4 star wanted level.  i don't know if rockstar meant for this to resemble the whole illegal alien crisis, crossing the border, but that's what it seems like.i can't say much about the story, it's pretty much like all the other games.  you are the hero/antihero, you get screwed over, you meet a bunch of interesting people, you do cool things, justice is eventually served in a badass manner.  you get the idea.  you even have a mission where you get to fly back to liberty city (the city from the first game).  unfortunately you only get to be in one place when you get there.the new stat thing is alright.  like the ability to be fat or fit.  you don't really need to eat food, just keep excercising.  not many new weapons, if any at all.  and i also found this game to be a helluva lot easier than the last two titles.  though in some parts, you can get a little pissed when the game doesn't let you start back at the part where you died; you have to start waaaaay back at the beginning of the mission.  that irritated me the most.well, that's about all i have to say about this game.  so if you haven't bought this game yet, do so, or be in the dark about all the cool new gameplay features in this new title.  oh, and i made a mistake, skydiving is the second coolest new thing, the first would have to be the bicycle.  it's really freakin' cool, if you don't agree, you are a fool.  just kidding, but really, buy this game, now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2004"}

In most ways, this is the best game in the GTA series simply by default.  Two years in the making, San Andreas boasts the biggest, baddest and coolest video gaming experience of all time.  You are Carl Johnson, or simply CJ, who has returned home to Los Santos to bury his mother.  Once there, all hell breaks loose, in typical GTA fashion and the rest result in the evolution of video gaming.  You want to do the normal storyline missions and beat the game, cool.  But that is just the bulk of this monster.  There are side missions, which when completed turn into assests for CJ.  You can go have some lunch, get your hair cut, buy clothes, even equip yourself with some gangsta tatooes.  San Andreas is more like The Sims franchise rather than the GTA tagline.  There are hundreds of cars, motorcylces, boats and characters you interact with throughout this indepth game.  You will meet characters from the previous GTA games, which in my opinion, is the coolest part of this game.  There are some flaws, but none as surprising as the game's plot.  The storyline is typical, but for some reason, Rockstar chooses to end the game without any real answers.  We never do find out who killed CJ's mother.  All the twists and turns along the way seem pointless and contrived and in a way they are.  What is the point of CJ's odyssey across the entire county of San Andreas?  Tommy Vercetti takes over all of Vice City at the conclusion of his game.  The Guy seeks his revenge and moves on.  CJ you ask?  Well he simply returns to the hood he was dismissed from in the earlier portions of the game.  When his brother Sweet says that CJ is selfish in a way he is correct.  CJ's ventures in Las Ventures and San Fierro seem to be for his own personal gain.  All of which don't apparently matter at the game's conclusion.  Even with this major flaw, GTA: San Andreas is hands down the video game of the year for 2004.  It marks another step in the revolutionary Grand Theft Auto series, leading to the unthinkable next installment.  Oh and if you're still asking which game I think is the best out of the series, well, you'll just have to wait until the series is complete to get that answer...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2005"}

After seeing how people were having so much fun with the game I downloaded the demo and boy was I in for a treat! The game was super fast, super easy to play, and super beautiful! One thing I just have to say is that I was surprised at how great the game looked. The game is truly next-gen with beautiful open soaring vistas, crisp blue lakes and waterfalls. Free flowing grass, flowers, and weeds. Mud that really stick to your ride and makes you feel like you're slipping around in mud. The game is just so beautiful to look at especially when you're going 120 mph over 200 foot jumps off cliffs! Yeah this game is all about tricks, speed, and pure awesomeness (maybe this is why they just named it Pure so you can fill in the rest?) the game really feels fast, but the tracks are open and big enough for you to slip and slide around in without feeling cramped.The name of the game is all about building your ride and doing tricks (ok the name is actually Pure, but work with me!) When you start out you can build your ride from scratch, and I mean straight from the frame and you add shocks, tires, drums, brakes, the body, foot rests, the whole nine yards. You can even change what your hand bars look like, the color, decals, I mean customizing your ride is insanely detailed and nothing like this has been done in an ATV game before. Of course you can pick your characters as well, but there's not customization in that and I thought that was pretty lame since you look at your character more than your ride anyways. You can unlock new parts and upgrades for your ATV as you win races (yes 1st place on every event or you don't get the good stuff). There are plenty of parts and you slowly get better and better upgrades to keep up with the competition so there are no worries on that part and as you unlock more ATV slots you can just make endless different types of ATVs.You're probably wondering what it's like to actually race right? Well that's the best part! You preload your jumps like in all ATV racing games and you press the right stick in any direction plus one of the face buttons to do a trick. Ok it's a lot more involved then that and there is a unique twist to all of this here. The trick system is integrated into the boost system so you can spend your boost with the X button as normal OR you can save it and unlock new buttons to perform new tricks with as your bar fills up. Get it half way up and you get the B button which lets you do intermediate tricks and these take longer to pull of than the A button tricks. Get your bar almost all the way up and you unlock the Y button tricks and these are the cooler more advanced tricks that take the longest. Get your bar ALL the way up and you get a special trick bonus and you can perform a special trick by pressing the right stick in any direction plus pressing the RB+LB buttons. This takes a good 4-5 seconds to pull off so only do this on the SUPER high jumps! But wait there's more!You just can't keep pulling off the same trick over and over since there is a rating system. Every time you do a new trick you'll get a \"Fresh!\" star next to the name of the trick; do it again and you get a silver \"Tame!\" star, and three times you get a bronze \"Stale!\" star. Tame stars give you a tiny bit of boost and Stale stars don't give you any boosts. Link tricks together and you can get major boost...umm boosts and you can quickly unlock the other buttons. Wait there's more though! You can also tweak your tricks by pressing either the LB or RB buttons; while these take longer to perform they give you an extra boost.Tricks also have different effects in different race types. There are only three types, but they are very fun: Race, Sprint, and Freestyle. The Race event is what I was just talking about, so you race three laps and you have multiple branches throughout the track that you can take to cut off the other racers and hopefully gain a lead. These are a must learn since there is a strategy to winning each track. Sprint is 5 laps of a 25-40 second track that maybe has 2-3 small jumps on it so you must nail these to get your boost! Freestyle is probably the most robust event where you have a \"gas gauge\" and you have to get the highest score before your gas runs out. Linking tricks together give you a multiplier timer and picking up pick-ups along the way can help this. Some range from freezing your gas for a few seconds, some give you an automatic special trick, some double your score, some give you boost etc. The Freestyle event is always fun and the gas tank meter keeps you on your feet.Now all of this is fine and dandy, but the game does have some flaws. The AI can be very hard and frustrating since no matter how well you race you can never make 1st. I had to start races over dozens of times to nail first place and you have to memorize the track and drive flawlessly to get first place. Like I mentioned you can't customize your character, there are only 3 event types so this makes multiplayer kind of drab. The game also starts to feel very old and repetitive after awhile since there are so many tricks to pull off and the game is just the same over and over again. Still though you'll have lots of fun with this game and I hope the sequel provides more Pure awesomeness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"One of the best Wii games...but far from the best in the Zelda franchise","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword released with great fanfare.  Here, at the last moments of the Wii's life before the Wii U arrives, Nintendo has unleashed what they consider the system's magnum opus.  And does it live up to the hype?  Well...yes and no.  Let me get this out of the way:  Skyward Sword gets a lot of things right...but it's FAR from perfect.  Is it the best Zelda game in existence?  Absolutely, unequivocally no!  Not even close.  I know this opinion differs from the norm, and I apologize to Zelda fanatics everywhere.  But I simply couldn't give this game the free pass that most critics happily bestowed upon it.I'll start with what the game did well.  First and foremost...the story.  This is the most story-driven Zelda game ever, and it presents it in the most charming and beautiful way possible.  Bright, cel-shaded, picturesque graphics are used to tell and equally beautiful story (goodness...if the Wii could display in HD this would be the best-looking game of the year).  The game begins by introducing us to the main characters in their home in the sky, Skyloft.  Link and Zelda are schoolmates.  Zelda herself is given a huge role here, and we genuinely end up caring for her and Link's relationship.  In the brief time that we see them interact together, Nintendo managed to make a lasting impression of its two main characters that remains throughout the game's entire 50+ hours.  The school bully, Groose, is also a hoot (whose role later in the game is pretty cool).  Once tragedy strikes and the main story begins, we're introduced to Fi, a robotically-inclined personification of Link's Master Sword (more on her later).  Then, there's Ghirahim, the main villain.  Nintendo has clearly outdone themselves with this character.  He's creepy, maniacal, and very well-written.  The entire tale is accompanied by what is possibly the best soundtrack to any Zelda game I've heard.  This goes double for the handful of melodies that are fully-orchestrated.  The game's ending is simply fantastic, solidifying the fact that Skyward Sword is an origin story and setting the stage for the fifteen Zelda games that follow it chronologically.  Also, Skyward Sword has the best variety of special items of any Zelda game.  The beetle, the bellows, the whip...all new additions that are a blast to use!Where the game falters is in pretty much every other aspect.  As far as content, Skyward Sword is extremely anemic.  Unlike superior Zelda titles, there are only three areas in Skyward Sword, and you must go to them over and over.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanayru Desert.  That's it.  You will become intimately familiar with these areas (as well as Skyloft, which is the hub world).  Not sure why Nintendo skimped on environments.  The sky is littered with a few floating islands in addition to Skyloft, but they're literally tiny fragments that may contain a treasure chest or two.  The rest is just vast empty sky, similar to the empty oceans in The Wind Waker.  Compare this to the vast open worlds of Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword is pretty substandard.  There's also an alchemy component and item-crafting aspect to Skyward Sword.  The world is littered with random loot, which can be used to upgrade shields and other items.  There's also a variety of bugs that can be caught, and added to potions to give them different abilities.  Despite how cool that sounds, it all turns out to be rather pointless and has a \"tacked on\" feel to the game as a whole.  You don't really NEED the upgrades, and if you do get them, the level of improvement isn't that big.Another major aspect of this game is the much-lauded motion controls.  Skyward Sword requires the Wii Motion Plus, which the game utilizes to an utterly absurd degree.  To say this game has overdependence on motion controls is the understatement of the year.  The game IS motion controls.  I've heard many people ask, \"Why couldn't they add an option to play with the Classic Controller?\"  The truth is that without motion controls, Skyward Sword would be half a game, at best.  The huge majority of the enemies are designed around precisely striking specific areas, and just frantically waving the Wii remote around will result in repeated blocks by your foes.  Boss fights, too, require precise swinging or stabbing.  Flying around the sky requires tilting the remote or \"flapping\" it like it was your wings.  Playing the musical instrument du jour (the Goddess Harp) requires you to wave your remote rhythmically as if you were strumming a harp.  Swimming is also done by tilting the Wii remote.  This is all well and good...and to be fair, the motion controls are fairly precise most of the time.  But no matter how precise they are, they're not more convenient than, nor as precise as, pressing buttons or using an analog stick.  I found the motion controls lost their novelty fairly quickly, and in many cases I found them a nuisance.  Also, the remote was sometimes a bit too sensitive, and reeling my sword back usually resulted in a strike from the opposite direction that I intended...and of course the enemy changed its stance as a result.  I get why Nintendo went this direction, but I feel like it just got in the way.  They should've concentrated more on variety of environments than motion controls.  The harp in particular is pretty curious.  Since they wanted you to use motion controls, playing a song only requires that you wave back and forth.  Gone is the more intuitive approach of having you press buttons or directions to play a specific melody...instead the game decides what to play depending on the mission at hand.Then there's Fi, your guide throughout the game.  If you thought Navi from Ocarina of Time was annoying, get ready to redefine your criteria.  Fi pops up for the tiniest of reasons merely to state things that are EXTREMELY obvious.  There was a moment where I entered a room and the camera pans to a treasure chest containing the boss key (they come in a bigger, more ornate treasure chest).  Once the camera went back to Link, Fi pops out and says, \"Link!  I have some important information you will want to hear!  There is a treasure chest in this room!  There is an 80% chance it will contain the key!\"  Or another example:  Link is in a pirate ship, and suddenly giant tentacles rip through the ship in front of you.  Fi pops out with, \"Link!  I calculate a 90% chance that there is a giant monster outside.  I recommend going outside to investigate!\"  It is completely infuriating sometimes since she breaks up the gameplay so often.  It's like Nintendo is terrified at the prospect of having players figure things out on their own.So there you have it.  Great story, amazing music, awesome items, all mixed with unnecessarily intrusive controls and a world map that would feel limited on a handheld iteration of Zelda, let alone a full console release.  Yes, this is one of the best titles on the Wii, and despite its problems it should be played if you're a Zelda fan.  But in my humble opinion, it fails to improve on the Zelda formula on most fronts, and in the end I rank it as one of the more mediocre Zelda games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A smart open world crime game","reviewText":"As I write this, it's the summer of 2014, and Watch Dogs is a very popular game to hate.In some ways, it deserves the hate it's getting, but that's hardly the game's fault. It has more to do with the publisher Ubisoft and the way they handled the details leading up to the game's release. A couple summers back, the crowd at E3 2012 was stunned by an absolutely gorgeous-looking trailer that revealed Watch Dogs to the world. Hype built and built over the coming year, as Watch Dogs was set to be THE definitive third party game to launch the 8th generation consoles in the fall of 2013. Unfortunately, Ubisoft delayed the game's release, and by the time May 2014 rolled around, Watch Dogs was unfairly carrying the weight of being the savior of what had been something of a dismal software launch window for the PS4 and the Xbox One. Watch Dogs was not that. In particular, Watch Dogs sure didn't look like that beautiful trailer they showed back in 2012. As a result of all this, Watch Dogs has become something of a scapegoat for not living up to what people thought it was going to be.Once the dust settles, though, I think people will see Watch Dogs for what it really is. It's not new. It's not particularly innovative. And it sure isn't a reason to buy a PS4 or a 360. What Watch Dogs is, is a smart, enjoyable open world action game with a very cool premise, lots of intriguing things to do, and a unique approach to role playing that one rarely sees in games.You play as Aiden Pearce, a man filled on a quest for vengeance against the criminals who killed his niece. Like with most games of this type, the story is a throwaway, and this game is no different. However, Watch Dogs has some really good things going for it. Aiden Pearce is a hacker in a future version of Chicago where the entire city runs on a privatized computer network, enabling the corrupt government to keep tabs on everyone and make sure privacy is a thing of the past. Aiden's hacking ability makes him something of a modern-day urban wizard, allowing him to control traffic lights, explode electrical grids, and make bridges rise and fall, just to name a few. While the gimmick does start to run a bit dry towards the end of the lengthy campaign, the game does a great job of giving the player a very diverse set of mission objectives that keeps things mostly feeling fresh throughout. The side stuff in the game was surprisingly fun as well, and requires you to utilize different sets of skills such as hacking together chains of security cameras to reveal secret images, tracking down human smugglers, and remotely stealing data from other hackers by keeping close amidst high speed car chases. Even the multiplayer is creatively implemented, combining the \"don't get noticed\" tactics from Assassin's Creed multiplayer with the spontaneous \"invasions\" that you see in Dark Souls.What I liked most about Watch Dogs is the things it made me think about. As a hacker with instant access to the entire network of information flowing through the city, details about citizens' private lives, from their salaries to their secret fetishes, are available to you and allow you, in a sense, to live out a voyeuristic fantasy not seen in video games on such an intimate level. You come across a guy with a nice fat bank account available for you to hack, but then you see he's undergoing chemotherapy for stage 3 cancer. Do you steal from him? You're infiltrating a gang hideout, and see that one of the grunts has the exact same interests and ideologies as you, and is only trying to earn extra money to support his family. Do you still kill him? You have the ability, just as city officials do, to intrude on peoples' activities in their homes....do you do it? Watch Dogs presents these situations to you, but never punishes nor rewards you for making any of these decisions. It allows the player to get emotionally invested in what they're doing without forcing you to choose the \"good\" or \"evil\" option like so many other modern games do. I found this new kind of role playing to be extremely engaging, and hope to see it in more games.Aside from the sluggish car controls, Watch Dogs controls like a dream. Aiden moves fluidly like Wei Shen from Sleeping Dogs, and the gunplay feels top notch. A pleasant surprise to me was the heavy emphasis on stealth in many of the missions, and there were often times when the game feels very much like another excellent Ubisoft series, Splinter Cell. A well-thought out upgrade system for Aiden's abilities rounds things out nicely. If you're looking for an open world game with rock-solid action, a really cool set of powers, and a new interesting take on role playing in games, consider checking out Watch Dogs. It certainly doesn't deserve most of the hate it's been getting from the gaming community, and Aiden's urban magic is a smart alternative in a genre that is starting to become a bit saturated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"One of the best Squaresoft ideas, but they missed it.","reviewText":"I absolutely love this game.  People always review games and movies saying \"This is the best ever!\"  Well, I will not hesitate to say that this is the third best game i've ever played.  In rank: Tied for first place is Final Fantasy 7 and ICO, third place is Xeno.  FF7 and Ico are just far to supurb to rank lower but to different in styles to say which is better.  Xeno follows up so closely... here's the Lowdown.Genre: RPG, Sci-fi.  Mecha styled with Anime as it's foundation for themes and artstyle.Graphics: PSOne level, entry level graphics.  Uses 3d environments for moving around in with 360 view.  Characters and such are depicted with 2D sprites with many many frames.  3 member party follows behind main player.RPG/Square Elements: ATB.  3 member battle party.  4 euipment, 1 weapon 3 accessories (same for Gear).  Support and Elemental Magic.  Save Points.  XP, EP(MP).  CG and Anime cutscenes.Battle System:  The battle system is unique (one would think that this game was a beta test for Chrono Cross.  There are two combat modes, walking or Gear.  Walking of course is person to person fighting (sprite graphics).  You have several options but what drives the entire walking combat system are death blows.  At the beginning of the turn you have a full attack bar, anywhere from 3 to 7 points can be spent.  Three attacks Easy, medium and heavy cost 1, 2, and 3 points respectively.  After a certain combination is inputed, the character will execute a deathblow, given that it is learned.  This is a major part of the walking combat system.  If you do not spend these points in the attack bar, they go to an AP meter.  After enough AP is acquired if can be spent for a chain of death blows.  AP resets after the battle.  The gear combat is similar except only one attack can be made.  After every attack the characters gains an Attack Level up to 3 levels.  At any level ther can be a combo pulled off for more damage that will reset the Attack level.  Now Gear combat is also driven with fuel and it is used for every action except an ether attack (magic).  Items help to add do the damage, quickness and other stats.  DeathBlower items add the deadliest combos to the gear battles.  Booster mode spends more fuel but hightens speed.--A very neat thing that Square did with this game was to make the HP's of the gears and the players relative.  Players have a 999HP max while gears have a 99,999 HP max.  While palyers level up with XP, gears only level up with parts.  There is no part on a gear that makes it 99,999 though (scene once in a storyline battle).  A character may cuase 200 poins of damage to a gear, usually a killing blow to many walking enemies, but a mere scratch to the gear.Square really tried to make a great game here, and they have.  I believe they made a great game... but that's becuase i can see its potential and really judge RPG's more from a storyline basis and a character basis than anything else.  What really happened here?  Square made a game that exceeded the PSOne's capabilities.  Simple.  What happened then?  Square sacrificed so many things to make the game playable on the PS1 and thus almost ruined it.  It lacks so many things that we now find standard.  The controls are easy to get but there is no customization menu... no text speed control, just options for sound (Mono, stereo, wide stereo).  The menu is easy to maneuver and the Save Menu allows you to copy games and delete games, even Non-Xeno games, which is a plus.  What else... well they sacrificed the cutscenes too... for the legnth of the game they kept the wonderful Anime to only the most important scenes... and the CG only covers what seems to be just what is most cool looking.  I found many moments when i was yelling at it saying \"And you didn't Animate that scene?  God, that was one of the most important scenes.\"  After having beaten the game i can see that the truly vital scenes are what is animated.There is a neat little battleling between gears.  It's tekken like... kinda.  Not really.  It has 2 attack buttons, a jump, ether missile, dash and block.  It's a neat little minigame that will let you acquire two of the greatest items in the game... DeathBlower 3 and the GNSR(summ'n-or-other)50 which increases the Gear attack by 50%.  The strength of your gear does not effect the gears performance in the battle arena though.What really bothered me was the text storyline sequence in the second disk...  Just about all the second disk is key battle to key battle.  I would assume that this was to save room in the story, maybe it would have been too long any other way, but it just seems less fun... more movie-ish-like in the second disk.And about that storyline... it's really good.  I liked it.  But the way it is expalined and handed to you is so confusing... even when they go to explain it to you, you're confused.  I'm pretty quick and got it, but boy my roommate mind boggled.  It's kinda good in a way... gives you a reason to play it a second time.It is essentially a good game.  But it seems that it could have had more to it... though it was long i would have liked to see the rest of it first hand instead of through the words of the characters invovled.  It is really twisted plot that holds many mysteries and ultimately will make sense.  But just as you think you understand you really don't.  I would highly recommend this game to those with patience.  Power gamers would like this game too.  I would also highly recommend this game to Square's Re-release board... for a remake, adding more to it now with up to 7 times more space on the PS2 dvd... and better graphics... such and such.  It is a good game.  Has a little anime blood in it, but nothing really big.  A common violence package that Final fantasy games are used to seeing.  Has a religious context, but really isn't.If you know Chrono Trigger, Lucca makes a Cameo appearance.Happy Gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2002"}

Both parties seem to have an endless amount of terrible things to say about the other game, the other game's players, and the company behind the games.Having played both games for over two months and having achieved a moderate amount of success in both, my opinion is this:EQ2 is extremely community-centric.  On average, especially on roleplaying servers, the players are friendly and, if not friendly, tolerable.  Most are actively looking to take part in the community aspect of the game and enjoy playing with others.  The game's solo vs group dynamic clearly enforces this: although the devs have done a lot to improve the solo game, EQ2 remains almost a completely group-oriented game past level 20 for all players, past level 10 for some classes.  If you want to solo, you can, but you will advance much more slowly than the average group will.  Leveling also takes time: although the first ten levels and to a lesser extent the next ten can be achieved in a week of moderate playing, levels 20-50 take a significant amount of time to achieve and require a certain dedication to building relationships with other players in order to have a group readily available.  The developers of EQ2 also seemed to focus on immersion in a fantasy world, which lends itself to more in-depth roleplaying (which, not to be discriminatory, has resulted in a much older average age in the player base).WoW, on the other hand, is EXTREMELY solo friendly.  I leveled through 40 in a month with a moderate amount of solo play (10-20 hours/week).  For those who do not have the time required to develop a lot of relationships online or do not have a lot of real-life friends playing the game with them, this makes WoW much more appealing.  This game dynamic has, however, resulted in a fragmented player community made up mostly of people who do not understand group dynamics at a level necessary to accomplish group tasks.  The cartoon-esque graphics and Warcraft name have also drawn a much younger crowd than EQ2, and it shows: griefers abound, instant-messaging shorthand is everywhere, and no one really seems committed to the idea of roleplaying.So really, it's a choice: which of those two seems more appealing to you?  If you want a more mature, community-based timesink of a game, EQ2 is probably your best bet.  If you want a casual, soloable game that doesn't punish you for taking a week off but lacks anything even remotely resembling a decent online community, WoW is a much better choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2005"}

There's a lot of detail to the characters faces, their actions and it has some fantastic voice acting to boot. You'll want to grab some popcorn, though, because there are definitely a lot of cutscenes in Metal Gear Solid 4, and some of them are really long. This is easily the biggest problem with Metal Gear Solid 4 and it's one that has often plagued the series. While the cutscenes are very dramatic and well written, and while they even shed some humor, some of them are just too long, some of them seeming almost useless. If a cutscene is getting a little long, though, it would be a grave mistake to skip it as you might miss some important parts of the story. And if there's any Metal Gear Solid game one should be playing for its story, it's this one. The other big problem with the cutscenes is how they come at you, even early on. There are moments where you'll play for a matter of seconds only to be sit through a cutscene that's several minutes long. At the very least, you can pause the game during the cutscenes. However, it's hard to get over the fact that some of them really drag on. When you get to play the game, though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Review from someone who hasn't played MGS in a while","reviewText":"I'll start off by saying that I have not played all of the previous titles (MG, MG2, etc.). I have played the original MGS and I enjoyed watching my friend play MGS2. It was hilarious since he's a button-masher and easily frustrated.Having established that I'll give my objective review.__Single Player__The loading screen was clever, and wasn't as long as people complained about.First starting off the game -- before the title screen even came up -- is interesting and a bit confusing at first. But when I hit the \"X\" button the \"channel\" changed; it's then that I realized what it was supposed to be. So I surfed these channels for a bit until the main title came up. They were hilarious and just amazing to watch in their brillant colors/graphics and clarity. I happened across a parody of \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" where the lady had to identify one of the PMCs. Heh, there was even a cooking show that was cooking up snakes in a bunker.The game then began, credits rolling over the occaisional cutscene still. Interesting to watch, but I was glad that I got caught up on my MGS before starting. I could see where someone picking up this title with no previous knowledge would become confused real quick. (Thank goodness there's a recently released MG Database!)Gameplay is fun, especially adapting to your surroundings with Octocamo. It does take some getting used to, but it's basically 3rd person with the ability to shoot over-the-shoulder or in first person down the sights (ironsights, rail, red-dot, scope). Customization is huge. And very fluid after you bump into \"Drebin\" and begin utilizing the Drebin points system. I like how this was utilized. Sell off weapons that you can't use because of their ID tags (future tech disables other users) and then use the credits toward purchases of mods. Take your M4 and utilize the rails for a laser sight or Master Key. The environments in general look great and looking down the weapon sight has that realistic feel to it.I like how they incorporated the iPod into your inventory, definitely some potential there.__Multiplayer: Metal Gear Online__This was utilized quite nicely. The only gripe I have is that you have to register for a Konami name, then a Game ID. Which can't match. Seems redundant, until you realize you can have multiple Game IDs to each Konami name. The first character you create is free. Customize your PMC soldier however you wish.The Drebin Points are utilized differently, instead of picking up weapons, it's based off of kills, captures, achievements (Knock an enemy out and gain some points, # of headshots, etc.). Then upon your respawn, customize your inventory up to the amount of points you snagged, or retain them until the next time for even better weapons.The controls are the same (Items/Weapons, 3rd person, over-the-shoulder, and first person) and there's a nice tutorial that you can go through to get you up to speed.You can also customize your abilities. And the best part is that they're not \"locked.\" You can change them inbetween matches so that you're increasing the stats on each one. You have your choice of 4 abilities, choose from all sorts of categories; from CQC, Knife Mastery, Sniper, Assault, \"Trickery\" and even some of the SOP specials. The SOP allows for teamwork on the network, utilized through the nanomachines, allowing for you to know where everyone is, and if they're under fire or perhaps just knocked out. The more you use an ability, the closer you'll get to advancing it to the next tier/level of mastery.Definitely a lot of fun; looking forward to advancing the skill sets.And definitely recommend MGO for gamers looking to play online, advance in skill, and utilize teamwork.__Overall__Definitely fun, and looks great. A great stealth title, plus a fun online experience for you and some friends.Would recommend playing or reading/watching the previous titles to get up to speed on the background story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Chris Longhurst","summary":"Too many cut scenes, counterintuitive controls.","reviewText":"I had high hopes for MGS4. Next-gen platform - the writers probably learned from the previous games - lots of hype and lovely hi-def gameplay footage. It bode well until I put the disc in and it took 8 minutes to install the game instead of just running it off the disc. During the install, the screen is filled with preachy health-and-safety warnings like \"don't play when you're tired\" and \"don't sit too close\" and stuff like that. Oh oh. That's a really bad omen right up front.Too many reviews are gushing over the graphics and sound and I think they've fallen somewhat for the hype, because if you analyse the game for what it is, it's just not that good. So rather than gush and fawn, I'm going to try to tell you what I found, and what I think it's faults are. If you've read any of my other reviews you'll know that I detest dark games, poor control systems and game programmers who think they're being clever. MGS4 exhibits two of these so if you don't like to read honest reviews, you should probably skip the rest of this.So the faults in MGS4? Well - where to start?I guess the most obvious place is the control system. It's truly the worst control system since - well - MGS2, MGS3 and Hitman. It's awful. Other reviews claim a one hour learning curve. One hour? In what gaming universe is that acceptable? First impressions last. If it takes an hour to figure out the controls (and in MGS4 it certainly does) then a lot of people, like me, are just going to switch off. How are Konami going to hook new players to the genre if the game is so difficult to get into?MGS4 is largely a sneak-and-shoot game but once again, Konami chose to make it third-person. ie. you spend the entire time looking over the top of your own character. This makes it just impossible to move around properly because you're constantly fighting the camera and movement controls. It's like the original Tomb Raider in terms of the camera getting stuck on scenery and obliterating your view of the action at some critical moment. I've never understood third-person camera. It's a waste of time in racing games because it makes the cars uncontrollable, and it's a crime to employ it in what should be a first-person perspective game. How am I supposed to sneak, examine, explore and shoot when the camera is above and behind me?The answer in MGS4 is supposed to be the threat ring. It's an Anime-style halo that surrounds Snake and has bumps in it where the enemy are. It is described briefly in the game manual but it's never really introduced or explained in-game, so it's just sort of there. It seems like a lot of trouble to go to for something that could have been solved by simply using first-person mode. Then you wouldn't need a threat ring - you'd be able to peek around corners, or use the audio to hear people around you.Speaking of the camera controls; there isn't one invert-look option, but three. So if you're used to playing up-is-down on your vertical control, you have to change it in three places in MGS4. Why? Why not have a single \"invert look\" option?I think one of the biggest crimes in MGS4 is the sheer amount of gameplay interruption. It's like watching TIVO and having someone else with the remote constantly pausing live TV or skipping fowards.For example : weapon pickups happen when you run over something, but it pauses the game to give you a very nice but totally irrelevant info screen on what you just ran over. So the programmers spent the time to interfere with the flow of the game, but didn't spend the time auto-equipping the weapon. No - once you've picked something up, you have to pause, go to the inventory screen, equip or swap weapons, then back out and back into the gameplay. It ruins the flow of play.It's. Like. Trying. To. Read. A. Game. Review. One. Word. At. A. Time.Whilst talking weapons, it's worth talking about the targetting / aiming system. Third person mode is once again totally useless. You might as well have a nerf gun for all the good it does. So you have to go into first-person mode to aim, but this requires two controls to be activated - R1 to \"activate\" the weapon, then triangle to go into first person mode. Why? Why not just go into first-person mode when you activate the weapon?Once in first-person mode it's impossible to move around, and your turn speed is like having your feet nailed to the ground. I timed it - it takes a good 35 seconds to do a 360. So there's no quickly turning around to pick off the bad guy behind you - you'll be dead long before you can even see him. Plus, if you waiver even slightly on the R1 button, it flicks back out into third-person view where the turn speed is much quicker. So you end up popping out of first person into third person mode, the turn accelerates and then you've overshot where you wanted to aim. (Sigh). Why? What purpose does this meddlesome control system serve? This is another place the camera control just fails miserably. Someone is behind you so you need to turn around to shoot at them. Snake spins around, the camera tries to follow, but gets stuck on scenery and is now facing Snake from the front. Now you're facing the enemy but you can't see him because the camera is stuck.Then there's the rest of the interference problems.I'd hoped with MGS4 that they would have gone away from the 75% story/cut-scene, 25% gameplay split, but sadly not. In the opening 30 minutes of \"gameplay\", I must have spent 25 minutes watching cut scenes, and having control taken away from me for a Bruckheimer-esque slow-motion shot of something completely irrelevant. Once again - stuff designed to destroy the flow of playing the game. You're just getting into the swing of things when *pow* - control taken away, arty shot of tank approaching - *pow* control given back. I could see the darned tank without the cut scene - it was right in front of me! Or worse, you'll be running towards an objective and *pow* - you drop out of game mode for a cut scene of someone making you eggs for breakfast. Jeez. It made me throw the controller at one point and just stand up and shout \"Oh come on!\". Hideo Kojima - the game's inventor and chief designer - has understood that videogames are a great medium, but he does concentrate too much on the 'video' and not enough on the 'game'. For example : put MGS4 in, start a new game and a stopwatch and time it; you won't be able to actually engage an enemy for over 20 minutes.Speaking of \"what the....?\" moments, when you start the game, you'll sit through a weird TV game show clip where a woman chooses the wrong answer, followed by an advert (I think for women's perfume) advertised by gun-laden women squirming underwater with an octopus with a skull for a head. In pink water. I kid you not. I have absolutely no clue what that was all about. I seriously thought I might have had the wrong game disc in at that point - I ejected it and checked.Oh and speaking of loading - if the game is installed on the hard drive, shouldn't there be zero load screens? After all, Drake's Fortune, Paradise City and GTA4 manage to let you free-roam massive environments with no load screens. Not in MGS4 though. Every time you get into a tight crawlspace or have to open a door, you drop out of the game into a loading screen. Worse, you then need to hit 'start' to get back into the game. It's bad enough they have load screens on a next-gen game but to make you have to hit a button to get back in-game is just criminal. Again - interrupting the flow of the game.Then there's your assistant Otacon. He just will not shut up. He yaps and complains and - my god - the boy has verbal diarrhea. You can probably ignore 99% of what he says - it has no relevance to your gameplay. Problem is that a lot of the time - you guessed it - you'll drop out of gameplay to hear him blather on about something. It's like the programmers didn't know the PS3 supports bluetooth headsets. You know what - if Otacon is talking into your earpiece in the game (which he clearly does because Snake always stops, squats and jams a finger in one ear), why not have him talk into *your* headset whilst you're playing? That would have been a good idea, and so much more intuitive.Other things that are problematic? Well - the you're-not-quite-dead problem. When you get hit sufficiently hard (which you will because the control system will fight you all the way to the ground), you lie there with the breeze wafting your cape around - or your hair - or something else. For all intents and purposes, the game would have you believe you're dead. Only you're not - you're still alive but there's no prompt to tell you this. The programmers filled the game with meddlesome icons, popups, info screens and pauses for everything from picking up an iPod to changing weapons, but they didn't have the courtesy to tell you that you aren't actually dead. Of course by the time you figure this out, you actually will be dead because someone will have found you and shot you.So what about the graphics? Well, on my 120-inch screen through a full HD projector, it looks nice and polished. It runs in 1080p full HD as best I can gather. (correction from earlier assertion that it ran at 720p)The graphics are good enough, but they're not really next-gen. More like warmed-over PS2 graphics with some neat touches. There's a fair amount of aliasing (\"jaggies\") especially when the game engine tries to render lines - power lines, ropes, that sort of thing. This sort of stuff just shouldn't be present. Draw distance is good, but not brilliant. There's a fair amount of popup and fade-in for smaller items. For example when you get the inevitable cut scene of a tank rolling up, watch the flare launchers on it's flanks. They wink in at a ridiculously short range.There are other problems too - it's all in the details. The enemy soldier's feet are about 8 sizes too small for the rest of their body. The specular highlights change badly on some of the vehicles when they transition from low to high detail models. The dust and smoke effects, whilst clever, seem to use only three texture maps so the repeat in them is very noticable. One neat feature that is done well though is the Octocamo - where you can lie on the floor or press up against a wall and your suit behaves like a chameleon suit and takes on the texture of whatever you're next to. It's quite entertaining to see Snake running around the battlefield wearing a chintzy wall covering.The motion capture isn't up to much though, with jerks and pops between the various character's predefined routines. Stand up. Pop. Aim. Judder. Fire. Pop. Squat down. It's really very irritating. The enemy troops 'patrolling' motion capture makes it look like they're walking on tiptoes, and there's another obvious pop in the motion capture loop after each left-right step. Tiptoe left. Tiptoe right. Pop. Tiptoe left etc etc. It's one of those things you won't notice at first, but once you've seen it, your eye will be drawn to it all the time.In fact - it looks like they didn't do any new motion capture for a lot of MGS4 but re-used the stuff from MGS3. I put MGS3 in to check it out, and sure enough, the enemy troop movements are identical to the point where you can't tell them apart. So - four and half years to wait for the new game and they re-used the old motion capture? Classy.As I said above, the dust and dirt effects are nice, and the modelling of the environments has been really well done, but you'll come away from it feeling somehow empty. Occasionally you'll walk around a corner to see the culling routines pop a whole street in. Why? Why are these problems in this game? Did they just not do any QA on it?It's not that it isn't impressive to look at - it is - but it just doesn't have that X-factor. So I would consider the graphics somewhat below par for a next gen platform.Let's go with the audio then. Weeellll let's not. There's a lovely Dolby Digital logo at the beginning of the game but the audio separation isn't up to much. The soundstage is mostly middle speaker with the occasional left-to-right effect. Barely anything comes out of the side or rear speakers. I'm so used to playing games where I can locate enemies by sound alone, that MGS4 was once again a total let-down in the audio department. Again - the threat ring seems to be compensation for something that wasn't done right the first time around. The weapons sound effects are pretty weak - hardly any bass content. So firing the M4 is like firing a child's pop gun. Mortar rounds landing close to you shake the camera, but not your room - they should be full-bass, well-stereo-separated sound effects, but they're not. The best audio in the game is all the speech, but there's just too much of it.So - MGS4. You can tell I'm not impressed. It's basically MGS2 and MGS3 in terms of playability and longevity sprinkled with sort-of-next-gen graphics and 1990's audio. I suppose if you're a MGS fan, then this game will leave you shaking with joy but for everyone who's not in that club, this seems to be addressing a very niche market.Personally I just couldn't handle the sheer amount of irrelevant story and gameplay interruption. It's so unintuitive and meddlesome compared to Resistance:Fall Of Man or Call Of Duty 4 that you will just end up screaming at your PS3.Add to this the curious lack of of save points. You'll spend a lot of time carefully working your way towards an objective only to have the controls and camera ambush you at some inopportune moment, resulting in your death. (Incidentally, Otacon still has his lisp when you die - \"Thnake? Thnake? Noooooo!\") At this point you'll be transported back a good 45 minutes of gameplay and cut scenes for a do-over. Really really bad design.I really wanted to like this game. I thought with as much hype as it's had, and the glowing reviews in everything from Playstation Magazine to EDGE that it would be a game of the year contender. After the first bunch of failures (it took me 6 attempts to get out of the intro scene because of the movement and camera controls), I walked away to cool my anger. I came back after a couple of hours to give it a second go but then things were even worse. I managed to progress beyond the opening scene (at last) into what appeared to be a bombed-out middle eastern town. At that point, the sheer volume of cut scenes, control and Otacon interruption just made my blood boil. Then I was presented with a cut scene of a soldier defacating into a barrel (oddly with some of the finest sound effects in the game) followed by a cut-scene of his naked buttocks running away. That pushed me over the edge. Game over for me. What relevance is that to the game?That brings up an interesting point. Didn't we do away with the \"infinite pockets\" syndrome in the 90's? You know - where you can carry a seemingly endless number of guns and ammo? Apparently Snake can carry this barrel with him everywhere, along with all his guns, but you never see any of them. They just appear in his hands by magic. Shouldn't you only be able to carry a couple of weapons? Drake's Fortune, for example - two guns - a pistol in a holster and a larger gun on your back. That's an example of a problem with the previous games that I would have expected to have been addressed by now.After barely an hour of wrestling with it I just had to give up. As a gamer I just don't have the time of day for things designed this poorly. I've returned the game for store credit.I wish I could tell you I was an Xbox360 fanboy who was bashing this game just for the sake of it, but I'm not. I hate the Xbox360 - I'm a total PS3 devotee so it's difficult for me when I come across quality problems like those I find in MGS4. I so hoped the games for the PS3 would be better than this.I don't understand how people can proclaim this game a 'masterpiece' or 'awesome' or any of the other accolades bestowed upon it. Look at it in the cold harsh light of day and you'll find a so-so game riddled with problems.I've been gaming since Elite came out on the BBC Micro computer in 1984 so I'm no stranger to any type of game, but it's not often that one comes out that just leaves me thinking \"what the hell?\".My advice - don't fall for the advertising hype. If you're not into the previous MGS titles then you're just not welcome at this party (as the comments at the end of this review will attest where fervent MGS fans will no doubt proclaim me to be the Antichrist for not liking their game.)Pick up Call Of Duty 4 instead - you'll actually enjoy playing that instead of wanting to throw your PS3 through a window. If you must play MGS4, then rent it first to see if it's your cup of tea. Because if it's not, you'll feel totally robbed.One last thing : for all those who think that this wraps up the MGS storyline, think again. MGS5 is being talked about now, possibly as a prequel. If they don't fix these problems in that game, I'm sure I'll be reviewing it just the same in 5 years time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}

While it is very similar in looks and controls, that is where the simularities end.  For one thing this game is fun, non-stop action and excitement.  Doom 3 while fun in some parts could get VERY boring in places causing me not to want to play more tha 30 - 45 minutes at a time.  I have just got finished playing this game for 2 1/2 hours straight so you can say this game has me hooked aleady.The gameplay is much much smoother than D3, that could be due to the fact that I recently upgraded my 128 MB Radeon 9800 to a 256 MB X800XL, but still the game moves as smooth as silk.  The weapons sound great and theplayer dialog is also done very well.The graphics also look VERY good, clear, crisp and clean just how I like it.The gameplay is also much improved, for one thing there is finally a flashlight on your guns for those dark areas; so no need to wonder around in dark corriders shooting at monsters you can't even see.I just started playing this game today so I haven't gotten very far, but I can already tell this is going to rank up there with my favorite PC shooters of all time.

The realistic physics and sheer number of cars is fantastic.  This game will keep you busy!  And for all of you that complain about how hard this game is, stick to kiddie games like NFS: Underground.  You obviously aren't skilled enough for GT4.

While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo.

{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Beautiful, stunning, epic... flawed yet still great","reviewText":"Okami is probably the most stylistic and artistically engaging game on the Wii, to date.  The bright, bold colors and amazing art style feels like a Japanese painting.  Some people will disagree with me, but I feel the graphics are superior on the Wii compared to the PS2 version, although the parchment paper filter is no where near as pronounced in this game.  That's a shame, but unless you've played the PS2 version, it isn't that big of an issue.The game is impossible to play without drawing comparisons to Zelda games, and it is a fair and obvious comparison.  Playing as Amaterasu the sun goddess, you interact with the world through her white wolf avatar and by using the celestial brush.  The celestial brush is downright cool.  You will draw a manner of objects to complete puzzles and can even use some of your drawings as attacks.  There is a bit of a learning curve and it requires a steady hand, but the mechanic works.As you adventure through the game your actions will gradually rejuvenate and rebuild a devastated world that has been consumed by evil.  As you fight enemies and use the celestial brush to build bridges, draw rivers, complete constellations, and grow trees, the world becomes more and more lush as you play.  It is a visual feast and what is even better is that you actually have some control over how portions of the world look.All is not well in Okami, though.  For example, the combat controls.  Those take getting used to.  For those of you that played Zelda: Twilight Princess, the combat controls will be a bit of a rude awakening.  They aren't broken, but they are not nearly as accessible as Twilight Princess.  Timing your melee attacks is very important if you want to chain your combos together.  It will take some practice.  Or, you can do like I do and attack everything with the celestial brush drawings.Okami Pros:===> Stunning stylistic graphics.===> A huge adventure based upon Japanese legend and myths.===> The celestial brush is just plain cool.===> Awesome boss battles that require using all of your celestial brush skills.  Definitely a highlight of the game.Okami Cons:===> Camera control is kind of clumsy and could have been implemented in a better manner.===> Melee combat controls are stiff and difficult to master.  You'll probably resort to using the celestial brush more than anything else in combat.===> Clover Studios, the original developer is no longer in business and we will not be seeing any sequels to Okami.  That is just sad and makes kittens cry because Clover Studios was a brilliant development house.I would rate the game as family friendly.  In fact, it is almost as much fun to watch as it is to play.  It is a good game for players of most ages, but I think the learning curve would be a little too steep for younger children and the plot would be a little too obscure for most.  There are a couple of very tame sexual innuendo references and numerous references to alcohol and alcoholism, sake wine to be specific, but it isn't overt.  Some parents may be surprised, but honestly there are Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks movies that are infinitely more offensive.  Half an hour of prime-time television would damage a child's psyche more than this game ever could.Overall, I highly recommend this game to fans of the Zelda franchise, anyone who enjoys Japanese culture, or anyone looking for a unique gaming experience.  I won't say that it is better than Zelda, but it compares favorably.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2008"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"Miketheratguy","summary":"Almost perfect, with just a bit of cheap","reviewText":"THE SHORT: Super fast, loads of modes and options, tons of unlockable stuff, 2 players, custom soundtracks. It'd be perfect if not for a tiny bit of cheap.THE LONG: First, let me get that \"cheap\" comment out of the way.  To begin with, this game is fun.  Very fun. I'm no racing fan, and I loved it. I played it for 9 straight hours when I bought it. I usually only do that for role playing games.But it's during this extended play that I did start to notice something. I was learning the controls and doing progressively well, but then when I took on a 3-race Grand Prix challenge, I started to see that no matter how fast I went or how many times I hit them, my opponents were always able to appear right behind, or in front of me. What always kills a racing game is when the computer just gets cheap and makes the drivers experts who never screw up. Although this doesn't always happen, I have seen a few spots where it sure seems to. If I can constantly use turbo, not crash, and spin around corners without hitting the walls, should the other drivers just be expected to be right there doing just as well, only to whip right past me for good if I dare to make one mistake?Well, I reiterate: This has happened to me on only 2 or 3 of the stages I've played through, and thankfully, out of a combined 15 hours so far, that's a pretty good ratio.The rest of this game, I'm happy to say, has been fantastic. As I said, I don't like racing games, but upon seeing this one in action and reading the astonishingly positive reviews, I just had to check it out, and there's a lot to do. You can race against the computer, take on a friend, try causing huge pileups in specific \"crash junctions\", and do other stuff like see how many cpu-controlled drivers you can smash off the road before your car finally expires. You can do any of this at any time, or take on the \"world tour\" mode, where something new, be it a track, car, award, etc., is unlocked after you successfully complete a course. And although certain courses are geared to be unlocked only after clearing the ones before it, for the most part you can sort of go back and forth between what stuff you want to do.The action itself, whether in world tour or just freeform mode, is exhilirating. You are directly encouraged to do as much damage to other drivers as possible, while of course avoiding collisions yourself. Even after a good couple thousand destroyed opponents, it's still satisfying to ram a driver against a guardrail and watch the car flip into the air in slo-mo. The graphics and sounds are fantastic too, making every crash (even your own) seem realistic yet impossible, and at some points, even cringe-worthy.Crash mode is fun too, as you repeatedly get to try ramming your car into certain areas of a small track, trying to cause as much damage as you can in the time you're given.  If you're lucky, you can maneuver into bonus points and things like that as well.  It's a lot of destructive fun.There's no big customization or fine tuning involved in this game. Over time you'll unlock dozens of cars (although several are pretty similar), and the only thing you have to worry about is which ones are the fastest and lightest.  No other statistics necessary.And as I said, there's a lot to do, because even though this is basically a fast, arcade style destruction derby, there are still tons and tons of things to unlock for incentive. You start with a few cars and a track or two, but by the end of my first night I had about 20 cars and a dozen tracks. That's about a third. There are rewards and feats to win, too. Cause another car to get rammed under a bus, that's a reward. Cause more than a million dollars in crash mode, that's a reward. Cause more than 40 wrecks. Wreck three cars at once. A huge list of your progress is kept and there's always something to do. The only real problem I had with the game is that you can't re-map the buttons. The controls are good, and easy to learn, but since the R trigger is the accelerate button, your finger will be getting sore after a while, and it would've been nice to change this.The custom soundtrack feature, obviously exclusive to the Xbox, is a fantastic thing to have in this game. But you can't use it during two-player, for what I can only assume are memory reasons. Also, I mentioned before that some of the tracks or individual races can really get frustrating, due to how invincible and perfect the computer seems to be. Again, this has only happened to me a couple times and the majority of the game has not felt so difficult so far. Besides, you can work on other progress such as unlocking cars and other things, then try that difficult track later. I don't want my races to be cakewalks, but after doing well all day, having a sudden group of wonder drivers eliminating me drops this game from a perfect score.But, hey, what I've played so far has still been great fun. The minutiae of the game's modes and details are too many for me to go into here, but rest assured that although this game is essentially pick up and play, there is so much to do that you won't get sick of it after a half hour, such as similar games like Crazy Taxi (which, especially given the control scheme, feels a lot like this game). I think the best way I can put it is this: I just plain do not like racing games.  But this one was fast enough, addicting enough, unique enough, agressive enough, deep enough, replayable enough, and FUN enough, for me to not only like it but to have spent double digit hours with it and still find absolutely worth playing.If the game doesn't stay cheap like the part I'm hung up on now, then I will definitely assert that it's the best racer ever made.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's  dual-stick analog controller,Ape Escapeis the first game to require either an analog ordual shock controllerto play. That requirement  ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction,  while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.InApe Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype  intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young  friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to  repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as  they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to  help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying.

Its one of those game thats old, but never got boring even when I played it multiple times. For those who are new to the series, you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net. You're partially right. If you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net, you will get a game over fast. I own the other 2 games in the Ape Escape series and played them multiple times, so its safe for me to say that Ape Escape 1 is the hardest of the series. Let me go into a little more detail.A little background: I'm not sure about other consoles at the time, but the PS1, unlike todays Sony consoles, had a different control scheme. Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character, you used the arrow buttons. The analogue sticks didn't have much use. Actually with some games no use at all. In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on, but for some of those games it was glitchy. Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I'm happy it did. I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls. It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time. Now all games use this control scheme for the better.Story summary: 2 boys, Spike and Jake, are heading to the Professor's laboritory to try out his time machine, but once they get there they find the professor and his assistant/granddaughter Natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys. The monkeys leader (Spector) has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases Spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power. The other monkeys possess Monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as Spectors helmet, but less powerful. Spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way that'll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant. Its up to Spike to capture these monkeys, including Spector. I know its not the deepest story, but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future. Later on in the game I actually found it compelling. You also really grow to love Spike by the time you finish the game. I understand now, why alot of people who play the sequals wish Spike was the main character again.Gameplay elements and monkeys: Once again you catch monkeys, but its easier said than done. The first 3 levels are pretty easy, but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game. The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down, like Man eating plants and annoying bees. I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT! Laser guns, bombs, machine gun, HOLLYCOW! Don't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid. There are different kinds of monkeys. I'll just summarize what they do. Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch. Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get. Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty. Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement. White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on (understatement. Impossible unless someone says other wise). Black pant monkeys carry oozies/machine guns. I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games. Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys. Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards. Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you've already guessed from my description of them, they are hard to catch. Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that couldn't be caught before. Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder, depending on the strategy used. The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games. Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless. You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket. I've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.Levels: The levels are divided by eras (the whole travel through time element). For example: Im in the dinosaur era and I play 3 levels from this era one after the other (unlock them), catch the required number of monkeys, then leave, unlocking a new era with 3 more levels (Hope that explains it good). Each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesome.Music: OMG! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time. Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music. Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame. The music excites you and is very enjoyable. It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack. In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one, so I think the makers learned from their mistake. My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle, Dark Ruins, Galaxy Monkey, The Spector theme, and a few others, but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them. It's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.Replayabillity: Compared to the other games, Ape Escape 1 doesn't have much replayabilty, unless you're like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time. Throughout the levels there are Spector coins you pick up. the coins are used to unlock 3 minigames in the time station. My favorite of these is galaxy monkey. The other two are meh. I really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games. That would have been awesome.I've gone down memory lane long enough. The sad part is I still have my old Ape Escape game, but it no longer works anymore. I'm definately buying it off amazon. I wish instead of porting Ape Escape to the PSP, they would have ported it to the PS2, with an soundtrack unlockable available. Given that attention is mostly put on the PS3 and other next gen consoles/games nowadays I don't see a port happening soon (the PS3 doesn't even play older games according to some people I've asked). Ape Escape is definately worth buying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

Johnson","summary":"Expensive, but is the Real Deal","reviewText":"If you have played Guitar Hero, or even Rock Band for any amount of time or played these games on display retail stores, chances are you have experienced guitar malfunctions like double-strumming or simply the button presses not registering at all.  This is VERY frustrating especially when you are trying to concentrate on the button patterns on the screen as well as having to compensate for the lack of quality in the controllers themselves.  I have gone through 3 Guitar Hero 3 controllers just from normal use and the pogo pins that were used in designing that become very unreliable after some time.  The Rock Band controller which is built much better than the Guitar Hero controller also may eventually suffer from episodes of double strumming and the strum bar itself seems a little too flimsy.  I am on my third Rock Band controller as a result and even this one seems to be messing up again.  My 4th Guitar Hero controller is also messing up again, with buttons not registering or just cutting off for no reason during a sustained note.  It had gotten so bad with Guitar Hero, I haven't even played the game in over a month and I contemplated being done with the series for good since I had a hard time finding a good reason to spend more money on another controller that would also break down the line (after the warranty period of course).Well if you have the money and are sick of dealing with this plastic mess that comes with these games then I encourage you to take a look at this premium guitar controller made by Logitech.  Like me, the first thing you will notice is the sheer weight of it.  While its only slightly bigger than the Rock Band controller, its twice the thickness and it tips the scales at nearly 8 pounds.  The guitar is made from the same materials as a real guitar so you a neck that is real wood neck, metal tuning pegs that actually turn and a rosewood finger board.  Knock on it with you fist you won't hear the cheap hollow plastic sound you would hear with the standard controllers. I haven't held a real electric guitar so I don't know how the weight compares to the real thing but I imagine if it uses real material, then its close to the real weight.  For comparison purposes, it seems to be about the same weight as my cello was.What is even better is that it is very responsive.  There are no issues with double strumming or unregistered button presses and once you get over the weight of it you should become very comfortable with using it.  In fact I was able to get even higher scores on songs that I thought I had already maxed out.  I tried this controller on my two Guitar Hero tiles, that I currently own. Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero 3.  Of course this will work with the newer Guitar Hero games as well.  For those that are wondering, it also works great for Rock Band, but for some reason, Activision (the parent company of the the maker's of Guitar Hero) \"Expressly prohibits\" you from using this controller with Non-Guitar hero games.  I have no idea what that is all about, but anyway.The strum bar seems to be built to last and in addition to be quiet like the the Rock Band controller's there is also a slight click feel whenever you move it up and down giving you the feedback you need during intense strumming sections.  The Rock Band controller's strum bar was virtually silent, but lacked the click feedback.  On the other hand, the Guitar Hero 3 controller had the click feedback, but was very loud.  This guitar combines the best of the two into one.  Because this controller is made for Guitar Hero and not Rock Band, it lacks the solo buttons that are on Rock band controllers and IF you were to use this controller for Rock Band, you do not have the ability to tap the solo sections as you can do on the standard controller.  Its really my only complaint and though it would have been a nice addition to have both the slider AND solo buttons, I realize this controller was made for Guitar Hero's games so there was no need for them to add the \"solo buttons\" and I am sure Activision saw to it that Solo buttons were NOT added since using this controller with Rock Band is \"EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED\".I remember playing Guitar Hero in the arcade for the first time and I really liked the durability and feel of the controller and mentioned to my wife how they should make the same type of durable controller available for home use.  Well Logitech did just that but it will cost you...I love the guitar.  However, even though the money I spent replacing my controllers would have been able to get this one instead, I don't think I could part with so much money to get this unless I just had a couple of hundred bucks laying around.  However if you are VERY serious about your Guitar Hero games and sick of having the plastic controllers break constantly and feeling cheap and can part with a good chunk of change, then I recommend this controller.  I will update my review accordingly if it starts giving me problems down the road, but from what it seems like now, this controller seems to be VERY durable and if you were to purchase it, it should be the last Guitar Hero controller you'll ever need to buy and let's hope so considering the steep price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

Armed with your wits, a sword, and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth.From the original developers of the critically acclaimed ICO, comes a masterpiece of an adventure.","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"A great title from the makers of Ico","reviewText":"You don't have to play Ico to enjoy Shadow of the Colossus.  This game stands alone by itself.  It's like one of those really touching independent movies that make you think \"Now that's how movies ought to be made.\"  This game is that saying for video games.BriefsType: adventure/puzzleGraphics: above averageSuitable for children: very much soPros: Beautiful scenery and very intense battles.  Beautiful sunlight effects and sound.  Story is touching.Cons: Camera can be annoying and controls take getting used to.  Short.The game is basically 16 boss battles of a large scale.  Literally, I haven't encountered larger bosses ever in a video game of this type.  They're not just the only enemies in the game, they're also the puzzles.  It's \"How do I take this thing down?\"  You have a sword, a bow with endless arrows, a horse and some strong hands and legs.  Trying to figure out how to take down these gigantic creatures covered in architecture and fur is what makes this game's puzzles.But you also have to get to the creatures, which isn't a challenge so much as it is an excuse to go riding across one of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever encountered in a game.  Sometimes I would just ride around and look at the sites wishing I had some way to take screenshots.  It's very beautiful.  But again, getting to the creatures isn't really a challenge, though some of them do require some climbing, mostly it's just exploring.  This can be a little cumbersome later as you start to get annoyed with the controls for the horse.  The horse will automatically turn away from obstacles in its way, which can often times lead you into a fight to control it (especially in forested areas).  But once you get the hand of moving around, you'll figure it out pretty quick.  I usually get the guides with games I get for the collection, and the guide game several extra things you can do with the horse that came in handy.The battles themselves involve you finding a way to get the colossus to expose a vital point, climbing over the colossus to that point and attacking.  That's pretty simple.  Harder to execute as you go along, as some bosses dive under water where you have to hold your breath, fly hundreds of feet in the air, or even crawl under the sand.  Most of them are pretty slow, but a few are smaller and rather lithe.  You can whistle to get their attention, or shoot them with a harmless arrow.  Also, you can use sunlight and reflect it off the sword and find weack spots on the colossus your fighting.  This is also how you find the next colossus.The story has a simple premise to it.  You have a girl who's dead in your arms.  It's kinda implied you love her and want to find a way to bring her back from the dead.  By slaying these 16 colossi you can bring her back.  So that's the idea and you're all for it apparently.There is a life bar you have, which can be increased by eating fruit you find throughout the landscape.  It goes down when you fall too far, when a colossus hits you or otherwise shakes you up.  Most of the colossi can only run into you, smack you with some weapon or step on you.  A few of them throw lightning balls at you.  The other bar is very important, it's stamina.  It's your ability to hold your breath underwater, to hang on, climb around thing and other physical actions.  You can't latch onto a colossus and hold on forever; this stamina meter makes it important to hurry up or find a place to rest, which is rare to find on most of the colossi.  You can fill this bar up by shooting arrows at lizards with blue tails and making their tails drop off.  If you eat the tail, you gane some stamina.It is very suitable for children, though it is challenging and pretty intense, and smaller kids might not have as much fun with it.  There's no violence beyond you trying to take down 5-20 story tall creatures.  There's no blood other than some black stuff that leaks from the colossus as you hit them.  The language in the game isn't even in english.  It's in that Ico language.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games or things with beautiful scenery.  Anyoen who liked Ico should also like this game.  I can't really compare it to any other game other than Ico (as well I couldn't compare Ico with anything before Shadow of the Colossus either).  It has some replay value though (something the creators must have learned from Ico).  After you beat the game you unlock Hard mode and Time Attack mode.  Time Attack mode can be accessed during any round 2+ games, but not on New Games.  You can get cool items from the Time Attack mode, including the dark queen's sword from Ico.  There's also a hidden garden in the game, but I won't tell you where it is.  Hard mode also has its own Time Attack with better items.This game is great in my mind (though the controls and camera keep it from absolute perfection, I do agree with GameSpy a little on it).  It's really worth a rent if you don't think you're into it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2005"}

Lets be honest here, the graphics don't look that impressive and the gameplay footage seems pretty \"tech-demo\". But if you have actually played Portal, you'll know that looks aren't everything in a game.Portal 2 is truely a game that focuses on gameplay rather than giving us a pretty package. I'm not saying that the graphics are bad, but the minimalistic/futuristic style of Portal 2 might not be for everyone (at first sight). Looks aside, the gameplay experience that you'll get from this game is unique; there is nothing like it. Not only will you have fun playing the game, but you'll actually feel smart as you progress through the simple but loveable story. The voice acting and the music are a nice touch too, they're incredible at delivering great humor.Reviewing a game like Portal 2 is not easy at all... there are no words to truely describe the experience in terms of gameplay satisfaction.

{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"senseless fun","reviewText":"In 2 words, this game is senseless fun. I would have given this fun game 5 stars, but the cover system just doesn't always work well.This is a game for the old school gamer type IMO. For me, this campaign is more fun to me than most campaigns. At levels 47 and 48, the story ties together and you start to care a lot more for the characters, but at that point the campaign is almost over. Each mission is short. After each mission you get to choose new weapons, weapon accessories, new tattoos for your character, and new masks with the money you've earned. Your upgraded weapons actually show when you're playing the game in third person, and during cut scenes. I've played countless amount of games, and all I'm thinking about is getting the trophy. This reward system should be used in every video game.The Bad: For me, getting the cover system to always work was frustrating. I don't think it was explained well enough when the tutorial forces you to take cover. The tutorial shows you to press x with a sign which I suppose was to hold down on the D-pad. For me, the only way to get the cover to work was to keep hitting x or hold down on x, or running and holding x.The Fun: For me, I'm average at shooters, and played at the easy difficulty level. I've played other games at the easy difficulty, and didn't find them easy. I'm not looking for an extreme challenge or some puzzle I can't figure out, which causes me to just quit the game. For the most part my partner led me in the right direction which I liked. The sounds of all the weapons were fun. Beating short levels were fun, and weren't monotnous. Environments were destrucable. Getting revived and reviving your partner was also fun. This isn't one of those games you can play in one long sitting. Most of the levels are similar with different environments. You shoot bad guys, and earn money for new weapons, weapon accessories, masks, and tattoos. Point blank. If you're looking for a deep story, forget about this title. If you're looking at a way to relieve stress with several short sittings, pick this up. It's fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

Other aspect...meh","reviewText":"I see a good portion of the review here are disgruntled (very understandable, as I've had numerous problems with Steam through my year or so use of it) potential owner of this game.  But, as mentioned on the title, I had little problem unlocking and playing this game (took all of 15 minutes for me).  When the game started up, off I went.First moment of gameplay - 18 Nov 2004, 7:45 pm (roughly). First break (besides the crashes to desktops and all) came the next day at 9:15 am (roughly) when I could no longer keep my eyes open.  After a few hours of shuteye, I went back and finished off the game.  Total time spent was about 15 hours to finish the game.That 15 hours seem like a lot, but after playing it, and seeing the end credit, all I could think was, \"...that couldn't have been the end.\"  The game leaves too many unanswered question I and host of others had from HL1 6 years ago.  Not only does it leave those threads unanswered, it creates more question on top of it.Also, this might have to do something with the source theft incident, but many of the scenes, weapons, enemies you were looking forward to after having seen the preview is missing in this the final version of the game.  The famous 'hydra' is not there, the Gravity 'beam' gun is missing, along with the 'planned' sniper rifle and the OICW assault rifle, and the game is very glitchy.  I had to endure several game crashes, 2 computer crash (restarts), and all throughout the game had problems with sound stuttering (graphical glitch, I can attribute to my mediocre graphics card).  I'm wondering how far back the theft of the code pushed this game to.  Because the game still feels like it's in need of a couple beta testing to iron out those kinks.The multiplayer for HL2 comes in the form of CS:source, the graphically updated version of Counter-Strike.  For me, CS:S feels too much alike to CS to completely enjoy. It would only take them giving new maps to play instead of graphical update of old and over-played maps for me to enjoy playing CS:S.  So thusfar, I'm holding out until more maps are created and played on many servers before I immerse myelf in CS:S.Hopefully, not too many of the mod community has become ex-fans.  I'm still hoping that Valve might perhaps release 'deleted' scene like they did with CS:CZ so we can take a stab at the hydra.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2004"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"It's ruined by bugs...yes, me too.","reviewText":"If only I had read reviews before I bought this game. I was so blown away by Fallout 3 that I had no hesitation buying Fallout New Vegas, and sadly I am quite disappointed. Not just by the bugs (which I'll get to in a bit), but by the general lack of anything new.Fallout 3 was an epic game of exploration and adventure, with an almost limitless map to traverse and thousands of weapons, enemies, friends and locations to discover. My praise for the company that released it was (and still is) very generous. What has really let Fallout New Vegas down is that it looks feels and plays exactly the same. It's still the post apocalyptic future, you still play as a lone crusader meeting all sorts of people and fighting for justice (or just being badass if you want). But it's not even remotely like playing a new game...it's just an expansion of it's predecessor. Everything is repeated, everything is the same. And although there was nothing wrong with Fallout 3, I wanted something at least slightly new.So basically, this time you run around the devastated Mojave desert instead of Washington DC, making friends in towns and settlements, forging alliegences, making enemies, discovering locations, etc etc, all with the aim of hopefully heading towards some epic fight for justice or domination, whichever you decide. Trouble is, Fallout 3 did it all much better. The ruined city of Washington was outstanding, seeing all those toppled monuments looked really fantastic. Here all we have is Las Vegas, well some of it, and there's nothing breathtaking about the scenery at all this time around. Also gone is the warren of subway lines to help you pop out in all sorts of new places (although that did get a bit exhausting I will admit). Whats new is that you can now have two longterm travelling companions, who help out by shooting enemies and carrying your extra baggage, which I liked. Plus there are at least FIVE different warring factions for you to choose between siding with or becoming enemies with. Which means you can choose one of (I think ) five different ways to end the game. I found this a bit stressful, as none of them seemd a clear good ending to me, you always have to betray somebody, and not just the bad guys - although the game seems to want to point out that no global solution could ever be 100% all good for all the people, which I guess is realistic! Sadly the climax of the game did not seem as epic as the one from Fallout 3 with it's robotic giant stomping all around. Fallout New Vegas does have a climactic battle of sorts but it seemed on a far smaller scale.Anyway, lets address the far more serious matter, which is that this game is swamped with technical problems. At the beginning I didn't have any trouble, but as things went on I noticed the game would freeze upon entering a new area (that's when the autosave happens) and I would have to reboot the PS3 to get out of it. But here's ssomething even more scary, though, there were at least two occasions when my PS3 actually TURNED ITSELF OFF as the game crashed so badly that the poor machine couldn't cope with it. This nearly gave me a heart attack! Towards the end of the game the crashing after going through doors becaem so frequent that I was saving constantly to insure I didn't lose progress. And I am talking freeze-ups at regular 15-30 minute intervals, each time requiring a total reboot. Unacceptable.That in itself was bad enough, but there was more. In-game characters (usually the companions) would often disappear and show up miles away, or not follow you through doors. And I actually failed two missions because of the NPCs random crazy behaviour. An example of what happened to me is the mission involving the secret of the White Glove Society. No spoilers here, but I was in the location, strolling about, when all of a sudden everyone started cowering in terror, and the White Glove characters turned on me and started attacking. There was no reason for this. I was unable to play out the mission because of it, and then the same thing happened again in the Gomorrah casino and at this point I almost stopped playing the game. I managed to get to the end of the whole game but the fun had long since been extinguished.What could have been another great Fallout experience was ruined for me. Wondering whether simply opening a door is going to lead to a total crash and reboot of your PS3 is not my idea of fun. Hell, sometimes it even happened when I turned around too fast. My advice is if you haven't played Fallout 3, buy it immediately. But I can't recommend buying this one unless they fix everything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0007M2266","description":"LEGO Star Wars blends the unique world of LEGO with the adventure of Star Wars,  for unforgettable action and fun. Live the most popular moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Episodes I to III come to life -- and you can become a part of the story!","reviewerName":"Robert Jenkins \"video geek #1\"","summary":"Star Wars and Lego - how can you go wrong??","reviewText":"This game is one of that rare group that manages to successfully appeal to young kids and older gamers alike.  Young kids will enjoy the game's ease of play, the thrill of swinging a lightsaber, using the force, and the not-too-difficult puzzle solving, and adults will enjoy the Star Wars atmosphere and the sense of nostalgia that comes from messing with those Lego blocks.  And everyone will enjoy the humor that is liberally spread throughout the game.You begin the game in control of Qui-Gon Jinn and the Episode I version of Obi-Wan Kenobi in Dexter's Diner, which will serve as your \"base\" throughout the game.  There are three doors in the diner, which lead to the Episode I, II, and III levels respectively.  There is also a fourth door which leads to a bonus level which you can unlock through the course of playing the game (I won't spoil it, but it is definitely worth the effort to unlock!)  You can go through the game in \"Story\" mode, when you play each level more or less in order of their appearance in the films, controlling characters appropriate to the level.  Then, as you finish each level, you can choose to re-play it in \"Free\" mode, which allows you to take in any two characters you choose from your available group that you have unlocked.  So you can do things such as have Jango Fett take on Darth Maul, or have Count Dooku battle armies of battle droids, or many other fun possibilities.If you just play through the game in Story mode, you can finish the three episodes in a few hours.  But the fun really starts when you start on Free mode and replay the various levels to find secret areas and items, and also to earn extra money to buy additional characters and fun options.  In each level, there are 10 secret Lego canisters.  As you collect each canister, you construct a Lego model of a ship from the SW universe.  The models can be seen in the parking lot of Dexter's Diner.  Or you can concentrate on getting all the characters in the game (there are quite a few) unlocked.  Also, as you unlock the various characters, they will hang out in Dexter's Diner when you aren't using them, wandering around at random and getting into fights.  You can have a lot of fun just hanging around the diner, taking control of different characters and causing mayhem.  And yes, it is possible to chase Jar-Jar around and shoot him or attack him with a lightsaber.  Repeatedly.In order to get everything, it is necessary to take various characters with you to access everything.  For example, Jar-Jar Binks and General Grevious can jump higher than most characters, so you need one of them to get some of the canisters.  Or some levels have doors that can only be opened if you have R2-D2 or C-3P0 in your party.  Or, you must squeeze through a small hole, so you need to take in young Anakin Skywalker or Boba Fett.A nice thing in the game is the fact that the computer always makes sure that, when you play a level in Free mode, you always have access to all the characters you will need to get everything (assuming the chracters have been unlocked).Different characters have different abilities.  Jedi Knights swing lightsabers and use the Force to manipulate Lego blocks, R2-D2 has a flying ability that allows you to cross lava pits and bottomless chasms, Padme uses her blaster to take out the bad guys and her grappling hook to climb balconies, etc, etc.  Every level has different requirements to get through it, so the action never gets stale.  There are also a few levels in the game where you are flying a vehicle of some type and you must dodge enemies and obstacles to get to your goal (The Episode I pod race is a good example of this).There are a few other nifty little secrets in the game, such as the Disco room that can be unlocked in one level (complete with a disco version of the Star Wars theme music).Combat in the game is simple and intuitive.  If you are a \"blaster\" character you can just blast away and mow down the bad guys (the game aims your gun for you so you won't miss too often).  If you are a Jedi (or a Sith Lord), you can either attack enemies directly with your lightsaber or else use it to deflect the enemies' blaster bolts back at them.  It sounds tricky, but it isn't hard to get the hang of at all.  It is possible to die, but if you do, you instantly re-spawn at the point of death, none the worse for wear.  The two-player option allows a second player to enter and exit at will, so if your young one is having difficulty with a section, you can jump in and help them out.There really isn't anything bad to be said about this game.  It looks great, it sounds great (selections from the movie sountracks can be heard in every level), it is fun to play, and it is just a blast in general.  If you like the Star Wars universe at all, you will like this game.  I hope they make a sequel using Episodes IV, V, and VI.  Highly recommended to the young and the young at heart!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000UH5C5Q","reviewerName":"Jody \"bigdumptruckdotcom\"","summary":"Not crazy about the lack of control","reviewText":"Four of us played Buzz Junior last night, and my biggest complaint has to do with the part of the game that was the most appealing to my son - the controllers. I will tell you that it took the 4 of us a good 15 minutes to get ourselves set up because we kept pressing the wrong button while choosing our names, and it sent us all the way back to the beginning of the setup each time. VERY VERY frustrating.Once we got past that point, we got involved in our game. The instructions are read to you, so even younger kids will be able to understand what they are supposed to do for each level. Although it would have been nice to have the option of having the instructions re-read, because if you accidentally hit ANY of the buttons while the game instructions are being read, it skips right to the beginning of the game, and you can't go back and start over. In fact, once we got started, we had to go through all 10 games to get to the end to declare a \"winner\". I don't recall there being a point where we could have decided how many games we wanted to play, and after the 7th game we were starting to wonder if it would ever end.Please note that this is NOT a trivia/game show type game, which is what we expected based on the controllers. There is a lot of throwing things (sometimes at each other) and trying to be the first to accomplish something. A couple of games are pure dump luck - one is pretty much rock, paper, scissors with soccer balls.Some of the actual games were a LOT of fun, (and some were surprisingly hard, given that this game is geared for younger kids) so I do give the actual gameplay 4 stars - we laughed a LOT while playing. But again, the controllers are an issue because some of the games were trickier than others, especially when we accidentally missed the directions. It was possible to go into a menu mode to read the directions, but that wasn't immediately obvious and would probably not be something younger kids would figure out on their own. Again, the games were fairly fun, and we'll play again in the future, but the controllers do sometimes make it harder than it should be.My ten year old seemed to be able to follow the directions pretty well, and he had fun playing it. I suspect this would be a good game for the elementry school set, but probably not for kids under the age of 5 or so.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"A nice gem of an RPG some will sleep on.","reviewText":"I remember a friend of mine working at GameStop who told me about this game last year in January and how this would be the Skyrim killer.  While it's nowhere near that hefty moniker, what I can say is that this game feels a lot more like a mix of God of War and Fable and to some varying degrees World of Warcraft. So far, it's a solid title and that it's being released long after the hectic gaming season makes this one a nice winter game to play with before bigger titles like Mass Effect 3 comes along. This is a game that I was looking for Too Human to be a few years ago and so far it's passing with flying colors what other 'huge RPGs' (like Two Worlds) tried and failed to do.  My only small complaint of course was with getting it to set up thru Origin because somewhere during the installation, it cut my sound drivers and game pad off but after a reboot and reconfiguring my system, it worked fine.Presentation- To me it's really straight to the point.  Good narrative of yet another warrior coming back from the dead via the Well of Souls (I was looking for Indy and Sallah to pop in!) and trying to claim his destiny. In the beginning, it feels very linear but as you go, you feel how spread out this world is. The further you travel, the more of the world you get to see but that's typical of any RPG. The one thing I DO like is that some areas that seem hidden, really are unless you know what to look for.  There were 2 areas I walked right past in the demo that I didn't see until I played this version and saw that they were hiding in plain sight.  As far as quests, you will always have enough to keep you going and not really feel overwhelmed, you also have a choice as far as what quests you want to complete.  As far as the menus are concerned, almost everything you need is a button push away and doesn't feel entirely cluttered. I even like the fact that in the inventory screen, you can choose to close parts of the menu to see certain items.Graphics- Suffice to say, on a PC they look brilliant but most of you already know that. My system has no problem running this at full tilt. But the one thing about it is that it's a brightly colored world, even in some of the dank tunnels the colors can be a bit more 'cheery' than most. Most people said Skyrim's color palate was a bit drab but as I stated earlier, it's almost wrong to compare this to Skyrim, but since it's the only other big RPG to beat out there, I can understand why the comparison is there. I think even for myself, it's not exactly the world I had in mind that R.A. Salvatore would conjure up, but this works just fine.Control- To keep it short and simple, it's easy to use and if you are using an X-Box gamepad, you should have no troubles at all. You can even customize your primary and secondary weapons on the fly, use reagents, craft, heal etc. just like that. If you play this on console, you can play it on PC.Sound - This is one of those little misses. The voice acting and the music is good.  The ambient sound is good. The one niggling thing on my mind (and I am sure it had to do with production costs) is considering that almost all RPGs have full voice acting nowadays, it's kind of hard looking at this game and not thinking that your character's voice is missing. If this game had come out before Dragon's Age it would have hit it out of the park if there was superb acting behind your character's voice.  It's a minor point but still one to consider looking at the fact that EA's other RPG franchise has it.Other Little Misses - While I do see that you have a dialogue tree and choices, I am so far not seeing that there are consequences should I decide to say something different. Maybe it  doesn't happen until later in the game but why give me a choice of dialogue if it's not going to have an effect on my game play? I think my biggest gripe however is that as nice as this game is, a multi-player mode (even a co op one at that) would really have been nice. I was ok with Dragon's Age not having one but with the way this game feels with it almost being a loot fest worthy of Diablo, it's almost criminal that it doesn't have one. If a sequel is announced, I am hoping that problem is solved because it could really benefit with more than 1 player in it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Brian Martin","summary":"Pretty Good","reviewText":"Even though this game has been out for quite awhile, I just want to put in my two cents. There's plenty of places to find out exactly what guild wars is, but heres a few reasons why I like and why I dont like it.If GW didn't have few things going for it it wouldn't be that special. I think one of the main things that make this game what it is, isn't nessarily the graphics, but the whole art direction of the game. From the box art to the character select screen, the game is beautiful. I remeber the main reason I bought it was simply the box art. I'm not speaking strictly about the graphics here either, everything about the game is pleasing to behold (oddly, except the loading screen.) Your character whether it's a stealthy assasin or a powerful warrior all look the part. I mainly choose to play chicks because I'd rather stare at the backside of a girl for hours on end, and boy does she look nice. Warriors and weapons are strong and powerful looking, skill effcts are nice, the scenery is beautiful to behold. And herein lay some of my main complaints with GW.GW has big beautiful environments to trek out and explore, but sadly there's no real reason to do so. Every environment seems like it was painstakingly produced but oddly is devoid of life. There are no \"secret treasures\" to be found, no secret pathways, no special monsters or special weapons to discover. In games like Final fantasy and Neverwinter nights, you are rewarded for going off the beaten path. Rewarded by a conversation with one of your characters, rewarded by finding a new spell or weapon. In GW you simply follow your green arrow until you get to a monster or your destination and that's it. NPC's are basically paper dolls that DO NOTHING but sit in one spot forever until you come up to talk to them. Towns are empty cardboard husks that only exist to serve you to find them, find some meaningless quest and go kill a monster. I realize that is somewhat needed given the nature of the gameplay, but come on these people could have cycles,they could come in and out of buildings, the could have SOME sort of life besides never moving and doing nothing.The main story in GW revolves around the CHarr invasion, but somewhere in the middle a whole host of new enemies are introduced and the story goes all over, what story there is to begin with. I'm later up in the game and I really have no clue what is going on, I just follow the missions with a friend.Guild Wars' problem is it wants to be a lot of things to a lot of people, but doesn't go quite as far as it needs to to satisfy the role players out there. It's more of an \"action\" game with RPG elements that you can play with a friend. It has some similarities to Neverwinter Nights and if it would take a lot more of them from it, you would have a serious winner on your hands. As it is you never feel like you're in the game. It looks as if theyve addressed some of this with the new expansion Eye of the North, but we'll see.I know it seems like I've bashed the game but it really is fun to play given what it is and if you understand you're not getting an RPG. The 8 skills at a time forces you to strategize and balance, the environments that you traverse are all gorgeous and well designed, and the multiple expansions means you'll never have nothing to do. It's just to bad it's not geared more to the person who just wants to experience the story and do a little role playing. For that you should get games liek NWN and Oblivion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"For Newcomers --- What Are The Downsides?","reviewText":"Because this game has been around for a few years, I'm gonna skip over some crucial gameplay elements and just list some nitpicks I think newcomers ought to be aware of.  I really like this game, and recommend it to every fan of action gaming and/or immersive narratives like \"Half-Life 2\" or \"Dead Space\".  But, it has some flaws that I think are worth discussing.The basic gist of \"BioShock\" is that after a plane crashes, you quickly find solace in a lighthouse (I think) that leads to the underwater city of Rapture.  When you get there, unspeakable horrors --- past and present --- await.  Rather than just shooting your way out of trouble, you quickly acquire Plasmids.  These Plasmids (and other tonics, etc) give you enhanced abilities.  You will acquire defensive abilities (i.e. less damage from bullets), offensive enhancements (i.e. stronger damage when using a wrench), and superpowers (i.e. electricity bolts, telekinesis).  Along the way, you are guided via radio to survive the ordeal, while doing some exploration to discover Rapture's secrets.How you experience Rapture is my first nitpick.  Let me be clear about this --- Rapture is one of the most magnificent creations in any form of entertainment.  Designing this city to be both beautiful and logical must've been both a true joy and a huge pain in the ass.  However, I personally felt a bit overwhelmed from start to finish.  Quite frankly, I found the arrow guide at the top of the screen to be a big distraction, so I turned it off.  This in turn made the levels very confusing, making the map feature a Godsend.  I know it's a strange gripe to say the developers and artists went too far when most games feel like they lack ambition.  But after seeing all of these beautiful rooms and creations, I sometimes asked myself, \"So what?\"  Strange reaction, I know.The mission objectives boil down to going to a room, finding an object, going to another room, and using your Action prompt further the story.  Pretty much every shooter does this, but if you're looking for a different tasks like \"Survive for a time limit\" or \"Protect this important character\", there is very little variety overall.  I suppose that would've made \"BioShock\" too complicated since the greatest strength is searching the area for all kinds of ammos and power-ups.One other issue I found is the amount of radio chatter and the number of audio recordings.  Like the overall level design, it's a tad overkill.  Because Rapture has been through all kinds of devastation, it wouldn't have made sense to have a lot of story developments unfold before your eyes.  However, the recordings are often placed in inconvenient locations, with enemies and security bots waiting to attack you.  So, you often have to go back and listen to the recordings later.  Same deal with the radio instructions: You usually get them at a time when you can't hear them clearly.  Maybe most players don't have these problems with the recordings and radio transmissions, but I often felt a sense of displacement with the game.  \"BioShock\" does a great job of putting you in awe, but a little more clarity would've been great.  I got the basic idea when I reflected on it all, but the first-time playthrough was disorienting.Some hardcore gamers may gripe over the Vita-Chambers.  When you die, the default setting is that you simply revive at a nearby chamber, and continue the game exactly where you left off, with your enemies as damaged as they were before.  The great news is that if hate that you can't die, there's an Option to turn off the Vita-Chambers if you want to survive the old-fashioned way.  \"BioShock\" continues to provide options for gamers for your personal tastes.  One customizable option that was a problem no matter what was the subtitles: They're too much in the way when they're on, and I could barely hear what people are saying when they're off.  Then again, maybe it's just my personal tastes.The concept of personalization carries over to the shooting mechanics, which may be too loose for FPS fans, especially since a single hit can really disorient you.  In the grand scheme of things, I think the variety of ways to play \"BioShock\" makes up for it.  For example, you can choose to use your guns, rely on your powers, or get up close and whack `em with one of the best melee weapons in video game history: The Wrench.  The initial confusion with picking all those upgrades & power-ups soon reveals itself to let you tailor your own playthrough.If I may compare these comments to another PS3 game, some people didn't like how \"Metal Gear Solid 4\" went from a stealth-centric game to a more action-packed experience.  What those naysayers might've forgotten though is that the traditional MGS gameplay was still there for them to enjoy if they wanted to; they didn't have to go with the flow of the new options if they didn't want to.  With \"BioShock\", if you want to stick the traditional FPS methods, you can.  But if you hate shooters, there are still plenty of options with for you to enjoy \"BioShock\".Speaking of the PS3, it was reported by some reviews that the graphics were overall better but the framerate issues remained.  I only experienced the occasional framerate stutter when I did the software update after downloading some mandatory PS3 updates.  If there's a way to avoid the upload or stay offline, I recommend it.  For whatever reason, \"BioShock\" was literally flawless until this update for me, and I think getting connected to the downloadable content might've affected the game a bit.  Still, this is a VERY minor quibble, and maybe it was just my console.  Check message boards and discussions for more info.So...why have I decided to tell what's not great about \"BioShock\" instead of giving it the high praise it deserves?  Simple, because I get frustrated when I play games that receive endless 10-out-of-10s, Perfect scores, and Game-of-the-Year awards when there are much better titles --- in my opinion --- available of the same kind.  \"BioShock\" is not the best first-person game I've ever played, but it's still pretty damn good, and easily worth buying with its low price.  I will give \"BioShock\" this much credit: There's really nothing else like it, and that alone makes it worth a peek.  If you're more forgiving and less picky than I am, please stop reading and buy this game right away.  Rapture Awaits!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

It's like GTA 3 but includes a couple more radio stations, motorcycles, more guns, and your character talks. It includes most of the things you expect from a GTA game: free-roaming, carjacking, side missions, fun storyline missions, cops, and many more things. But this game lacks some things found in the newer games (Vice City and San Andreas) like buying property, recruiting gang members, pedal bikes, the ability to rob stores, dating, and some other things. One thing I liked better in GTA 3 than in this game is in GTA 3, your character is a new guy trying to make it and earn respect. In this game, your guy is cocky and can get annoying in some cut-scenes because he thinks he's \"all-that,\" even in the first missions. Still for $20, it's a great game, especially if you do not own a PSP. The graphics aren't that great, but are still decent. And at least the loads times are fast. I recommend this game for someone new to GTA games or a big GTA fan. Remember, you do lack somethings in this game, so some people might prefer getting Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which is also $20 each at this time. A note to parents that this game does have blood, swearing, and violence, but it's nowhere near as bad as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

{"product_name":"B0050SY77E","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Campaign Review","reviewText":"Crysis 3 is a first person shooter. So are about 80% of all video games right now, so Crysis 3 has a ton of competition, and thus has to do something really special to stand out from the crowd. Fortunately, Crysis 3 does enough right to make it worth your time and money.STORYYou play as Prophet, a man wearing an experimental nanosuit made from Ceph (alien) technology. Prophet's nanosuit gives him super-human powers and abilities, making him humanity's only hope against the impending alien threat. Thrown into the mix are the evil C.E.L.L. agents who are humans trying to harness the alien tech for themselves. The concept isn't terribly original, but it's not poorly done either. The story picks up 30 years after the events of Crysis 2, but you don't have to have played the previous games to follow the story. The characters are fairly well written and interesting, and help to drive the story along. It was certainly easier to follow and more interesting than Crysis 2, anyway.GAMEPLAYThe basic premise is to shoot enemies and not get shot. What makes Crysis 3 distinct is the nanosuit abilities. In addition to making you faster and stronger than a normal human, the suit also allows you to turn invisible or shield yourself from incoming fire. Added to the usual arsenal of human and alien weapons is a new bow, which can be fired while cloaked and is almost always an instant kill. Because you are so overpowered, this means the C.E.L.L. agents are barely any threat, and the only real challenge comes later in the game against the Ceph aliens. While killing C.E.L.L. agents is fun, they're so helpless against Prophet that I started to feel bad for them. It doesn't help matters that the AI isn't terribly creative. When you stealth kill an enemy, someone will eventually notice and go over to investigate the body, which you can then use to kill another guy. This in turn makes another guy investigate the bodies, and sometimes you can exploit this to kill 4 or 5 guys easy. The Ceph are more aggressive and agile, making them more formidable foes. Some Ceph are heavily armored, making them almost impossible to kill without explosives. Fighting the Ceph is a lot more fun than fighting humans, but sometimes the disparity between the two can be jarring.The level design in Crysis 3 is a mixed bag. The levels are huge, but sometimes they feel unfocused. I got lost a few times trying to figure out how to get to the next waypoint marker. The path isn't always clear, but the gigantic playgrounds the game gives you allows for a lot of freedom in how you want to play. Nearly every situation has several options, be it sneak, run and gun, or whatever. The problem is that I found using a combo of stealth and bow was the fastest, easiest, and most efficient way to approach nearly every situation. Because of this, the game started to feel a little repetitious, however that was my choice to play that way.In addition to shooting, there are some vehicle sections, but they weren't very good. The buggy and the tank you drive are really unwieldy, and the flying section only allowed you to control the gun, not the plane. I give them credit for trying to add variety to the gameplay, but the vehicle sections were certainly a low point for the game.It's hard to describe the experience, because overall it was fun, but there were some minor issues that detracted from the fun and held Crysis 3 from being an incredible experience.CONTROLCrysis 3 is a busy game. Literally every button, stick, and pad on the Xbox controller has an important function, and some buttons have two functions, like the Y button which switches between guns, but double tapping Y switches to grenades, or the back button, which brings up the suit upgrade menu when tapped, but brings up the weapon mod menu when held. Having this many buttons to keep track of did get a tad confusing sometimes, usually during heated shootouts. Another minor problem was when the character would keep moving slowly after I let go of the left thumb stick. This is an issue with my controller, not necessarily the game, but since control sticks sometimes have these issues, most games program a \"dead zone\" when the stick is in the neutral position, and some games even allow you to change your controller's dead zone in the options menu. This feature would have been greatly appreciated in Crysis 3. Also, compared to some other FPS games on the X360, Crysis felt a little slippery. Games like CoD and Halo have very tight controls, and movement is very precise, which is something I really like in FPS games. In Crysis 3, however, when you let go of the sticks, your character will continue to move for a half second, seeming to have momentum, rather than coming to a quick stop. Again, this is minor, but when a half second means the difference between a head shot and a miss, it can be annoying.  Besides this minor annoyances, though, the game's controls are very responsive. The guns feel heavy and powerful, the buttons respond consistently and accurately, and you can even change your button layout in the options menu.GRAPHICSBy far the most impressive aspect of Crysis 3, the graphics are surely pushing the Xbox 360's seven year old hardware to it's limit. Crysis 3 runs on Crytek's CryEngine 3, and it can do nearly every trick in the book. Dynamic lighting and shadows, water, fire, lens flare, motion blur, aperture, normal mapping, particle effects, and on and on. The only thing it doesn't do is tesselation, but that's a limit of the X360, not the game's fault. Crysis 3 is by far the most technically impressive game to run on the X360. But all the cutting edge tech is no good without artistry, and fortunately Crytek's artists are amazing. The crumbling ruins of New York City overgrown with dense foliage look absolutely stunning. Equally stunning are the characters, who are dense with detail and animated superbly. There are scenes where Psycho (a friend of yours) is talking to you, getting emotional over the events that have led him here, and you can see the anger and sadness in his face, in his performance. The visuals in Crysis 3 are so good, they almost look next-gen.SOUNDThe sound in Crysis 3 is LOUD! Everything sounds aggressive, from the aliens and the guns to the vehicles and even the music. Every sound effect is good, it fits well in the context of the game and sounds appropriate to what it represents. Like a Hollywood movie, it may not be the real-life sound effect, but it's what we as an audience have come to expect a blockbuster to sound like. The music is fantastic, and fits the mood well. When all's quiet, the game plays some haunting piano music in the background, and when a firefight breaks out, the music becomes heart-pounding and frantic. The voice actor's performances are also very well done, with Prophet and Psycho being most notable. Some of the raw emotion that Psycho's VA does are really fantastic, and bring realism and weight to the character, even when his dialogue is somewhat cheesy. I did notice some strange SFX at some points in the game, like the sound of glass crunching beneath my feet when there was no glass there. It was rare, but there were some moments where I'd hear something and have no idea why.OVERALLCrysis 3 is a really great game, and I would recommend you buy it if you like FPS games. The experience isn't perfect (and I would have liked to see co-op and survival modes), but there are very few shooters better than this one, and from a graphics perspective, this is the best. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. I haven't played the multiplayer, so I can't comment on that, but as for the single player experience, this is one of the best FPS games on the X360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2013"}

Also Ellie uses these \"f\" word in almost every sentence. i have nothing against cussing but dang its just way overused. its more annoying than anything. The AI is really good at fighting and hiding, but on one scene , the ai was hiding getting ready for the next battle and an enemy walked by her . in the battle i was suppose to kill one enemy while the ai killed the other one simulataneously. the enemy had not engage because i was still looking for items before i started the next battle/scene. so as i kill the next enemy , the ai's enemy walks by and then she gets killed from behind. so these are no biggies,but it was noticeable. Other than those oversights, the game is ridiculously fun and entertaining. Great story line, great acting,good comedy, and awesome zombies and fighting. the game has great stealth. most of all it has a sense of realism. when playing you can kinda imagine how it would be if something like this really happened. low food, health kits, ammo etc. (if playing  on hard) playing on easy is a different story. gamers say this game is not great etc, i have seen it before its nothing new.. but what makes this game pretty damn good is has all these elements that i just mentioned , other than the glitches., its one of my favorite games that i have enjoyed playing. Get this game, you wont be disappointed. IMHO its above uncharted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}

Not that I speak from a lot of experience, but I do know what I like and Shadowhearts has it!Here is a quick run down-- Graphics- Good I guess, they seemed great to me, but too be honest, all games now have \"great\" graphics to me ( I grew up in the days of the Intellivision and Atari).- Gameplay- very fun, and quite easy (Until the final battle). The \"ring\" style form of battle is easy to catch on to, and adds a nice element of skill to the game.- The mazes - while they can get a bit repetitive they aren't endlessly long like some games. As you progress into a new cave/maze/challenge expect about 1 hour worth of exploring before you reach the main boss.- Game length - it took me almost 43 hours to beat the game... and that (I feel) is a pretty quick time.... I didn't do a lot of \"Extra\" exploring.- Extras- There is a nice variety of weapon add-ons as you progress through the game. While it isn't up to the level of Baldurs Gate, it does add to the game play.- Cut Scenes- Shadowhearts 2 plays like it is a movie, which adds a little extra interest, but some of the cut scenes can last over 10 minutes! At some point I just want to get back to the hacking.- The game is rated \"Teen\" but I am not really sure why. Often times you wonder why a game is rated \"M\", but the opposite is at play here... you wonder how the game could only be rated \"T\".- The game has many dark elements to it... and I have to admit I wasn't overly keen playing as a evil demon... but I got over it.All-in-All Shadowhearts is a VERY engrossing and addicting game. There is plenty to keep even the most experienced gamers busy for hours!  I would also recommend the Dark Cloud (and Kingdom Hearts) to anyone who enjoys it (and vice versa).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}

Super Mario World took Nintendo's popular mascot and gave him a bit of a facelift by adding new gameplay dynamics, a new sidekick in Yoshi, much bigger levels, and more challenging enemies.  When Super Mario World was ported to the GBA, the game managed to retain most, if not all, of everything that made Super Mario World one of the absolute greatest platformers of all time, along with a few added features.  Anyone familiar with the original game will feel right at home with Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World, which is perfect platforming pleasure all the way, and one of the best things you can play on the GBA.  The graphics and gameplay are pretty much identical to what you remember, while there are some added sound effects and animations, as well as the original arcade Mario Bros. game included as an extra (which is included with all the other Super Mario Advance games as well).

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros.

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros.

I dunno how to explain this game. It feels like I hopped in a time machine and traveled back to the past, only I ended up in the future, where everything was better, but I was still in the past, I don't even know where the present begins to fall into all of this... See? This is what happens when you play this game...Ok I'm gonna do a different kind of review here, not your average review.This game is FUN. I've noticed things from a wide range of mario games all in one in this game, and everything in this game only made it better. I can't beat many games 4 times in a row, so that should tell you how fun this game is. You're gonna want to play this with a friend for the best experience. I recommend playing with your girlfriend lol. I beat this game the first time alone, had TONS of fun. Then I beat it with my girlfriend, had even more fun than before. THEN, I beat it with my family. I'm talking 4 player action from start to finish. My two sisters, cousin, and I, all sat down and beat this game in a day. Speed run FTW lol. By then this game wasn't even fun anymore, it was beyond fun, which is a word I never heard of. People were laughing, screaming, yelling, jumping, all over the room. The noise level went through the roof. I'm sure all the neighbours heard, and my grandmother started yelling at us to shut the hell up lol.Let me make this clear. I don't like spending time with my sisters or my cousin. They're not my age, and me being older, don't really \"click\" with the current interest of teens and kids today, especially girls, since I'm a guy. We never do ANYTHING together, or have fun when we attempt to. THIS damn game, broke down barriers, LITERALLY lol. God I can't remember the last time I sat down with family for so long and had so much non-stop fun. At one point in time everything literally slowed down during all the laughter etc and I was looking around at all of us and thought to myself \"I can't believe this, we're actually bonding, & it took Mario to do it\". I literally got a tear in my eye, but only a little tear lol. I started remembering the old days when I was a kid, when everyone was closer. When it was over, we all got up and went our separate ways hahaha. I wished it could go on, and it did, when we beat the game AGAIN lol.I usually don't come at this angle when I do reviews, but I just had to do this to let people know this is a great game for all ages, genders, and backgrounds. You gotta love & respect Nintendo for doing what they do, even in a world that indirectly pulls everyone apart in their own little corner of the room with their own gadgets. Nintendo is still the best at bringing people together with their games, and as an old school gamer who's been gaming since the NES & Sega, to me, that's what it's all about. Online is fun, but to have old school multiplayer gaming at it's finest in this day and age, to have your living room full of players having fun, when the fun's right there, & you're not just playing with a bajillion people while still sitting in your living room all alone...*shakes head* lol online can't touch this kind of experience with a stick. If you're stuck somewhere wondering how to get your family to do fun things together again, make it easy on yourself. Walk into a store and pick up a copy of this game.

The series adds a dose of realism in the otherwise very arcade style gameplay, and it doesn't fit well here. I had more issues with the game than I wanted, but the game is worth a bargain bin purchase or weekend rental, just don't expect anything as amazing as previous games.You have to conquer nine deadly descents, and each represents a new \"gameplay challenge\" such as large gaps, darkness, ice, trees, rocks, etc. I didn't think these were fun at all. They hindered the otherwise fun arcade style gameplay. I also didn't like the realistic NASA maps of mountains because each level felt haphazardly designed, and it was hard to get good lines going because of the random terrain layout. There are caves and tunnels, random ramps, peaks jutting out of the ground near where you need to land and other problems. Wingsuiting into a tunnel that is completely dark is not fun or exciting to me. There's even a problem with lack of customization and gameplay modes.The trick system has been tweaked, but you can go back to the classic one if you like. Using EA's right stick flick system, the tricks can be pulled this way while tweaking them with RT. I loved being able to use LT near a ledge or grindable object and latch on. You can even use a mix of buttons and the right stick for people who prefer that. The trick system is simple enough, but using the right stick makes the tricks feel random. You can't plan out tricks or anything like that at all. If you do well enough you go into Tricky Mode which makes you go faster and gives you more awesome tricks to tweak. Super Tricky Mode or Uber Mode makes you go super fast while letting you pull off signature Uber moves. These are really awesome, and it did feel good when I pulled off long and intricate lines that scored me millions of points in one go, but this didn't happen very often.Trick mode is the only mode that allows you to use tricks to win. Races require you to stay on the ground and only do tricks to earn boost, but your score means nothing. When you beat the 3-4 events before the deadly descent all you have to do is survive. The timer is simply only for leaderboards. If you survive you get an automatic gold medal which is a bit too easy to me. On top of all this you can buy boards, gear, and outfits. The series uses signature characters, but I wanted to be able to customize my own character. Even the outfits are disappointing because they're just palette swaps.Overall, SSX feels random and haphazard all around. The realistic terrain hinders perfect lines, deadly elements like darkness, trees, and rocks hinder the fast paced arcade gameplay, and the right stick allows basically just random tricks. The customization is poor and shallow, and even the graphics are disappointing. The Xbox 360 had blurry visuals and low resolution textures which is a huge disappointment. SSX is fun while it lasts, but the 40 or so events will go by quick and will leave you wanting to go back to earlier games in the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

Wind","summary":"The Format May Be Dead, But That Means Savings For Me.","reviewText":"I bought one of these HD DVD drives for the Xbox 360 when they were first released, and while I liked the quality of HD DVD, the ease of connection, and the general features of this device, I also couldn't justify the price of it or HD DVD movies at the time. DVD was cheaper, and when upscaled by the Xbox 360, looked almost as good as HD DVD in some cases. My Xbox 360 was itself incredibly noisy, and I also didn't love that I needed to connect via VGA in order to get that upscaling or the high-quality image that HD DVD provides... So I returned the HD DVD player and waited for a format to emerge the winner.Fast-forward to late 2009. I've got a new Jasper model Xbox 360 which runs quietly and has a HDMI port. I decided to get the HD DVD player for two reasons:1. The HD DVD player for Xbox 360 is the cheapest HD media player available.2. There are more than 800 HD DVD titles out there that work with this player, and they're all available at bargain prices.For WAY less than the cost of a Blu-Ray player alone, I got an HD DVD player and several movies. I realize the format is dead, but HD DVD doesn't have region codes, and so I'm free to choose from any of the 800+ HD DVD titles that were released around the world. Imports work fine on thi player, and most of them offer English in some way. Import titles include many movies that were not released on HD DVD in America, and I'm able to find titles for under $5 these days. No, I won't get anything new on HD DVD. Production stopped in 2008, and so I won't be able to get the last three Harry Potter movies on HD DVD, for example. However, the first several ARE on HD DVD, as are great movies like Blade Runner, Dawn of the Dead, and several others that I enjoy watching many times over the years.Of course, being a dead format, I can't expect much support from Microsoft for this device, but I figure that used and left-over HD DVD players will be laying around in pawn shops and online stores collecting dust for the next decade or so, and so I'm not too worried about being saddled with movies I can't watch. There will always be some cheap alternative to get back into watching HD DVDs.And as a bonus, this player lets me watch DVDs on my Xbox 360 without putting the wear & tear on my console's primary optical drive. That's a handy thing.Negatives include the drive's need for an additional AC outlet, and of course, the fact that the format is dead.This is obviously not the best choice for everyone at this late stage, and I'm sure I'll grab a standalone Blu-Ray player some day soon (I had a PS3, but Blu-ray Discs were still too expensive to be worth it to me), but for now it's a low-cost way to get the most out of my HDTV. It's a lesser substitute for the winner of the format war, but it will do for now.As an aside, I will say that I prefer HD DVD as a format over Blu-ray Disc. HD DVD has better menu features, no region codes, smoother controls, and better network features. Blu-ray, while looking just as good as HD DVD, has gone through several specs just to get to the point of being CLOSE to HD DVD in terms of bonus features. I really wish that the major studios would have fought harder to make HD DVD the winner, but alas! It was not to be. HD DVD has joined Super 8, Betamax, Laserdisc, and VideoDisc in the hall of dead video media formats. Now all that remains is to see what kind of afterlife it can maintain.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Since they went and gave you all the positives I'll focus on the negatives.  This is not a negative review but flaws I found to be annoying in an outstanding game and possibly the best sports game ever made.I've had the game since launch and haven't even gone to the Jordan Challenge yet because I've been stuck on Association mode.  Trading is realistic in that you can't entice a team with scrubs and some draft picks for Dwayne Wade.  They will aggressively pursue your good players in a chance to get something back in return.  If I want LeBron (I would never but hypothetically) then I will have to trade Dwight Howard and a first rounder at least.  I also love the idea of draft day trades.  However, computer generated rookies often come in rated way too high.  1st pick coming in at an 84 is unrealistic.  Danny Granger starts off at like an 83.The player development is still iffy at best and I still do not like the development points and only being able to develop a player once a month.  It just seems dumb to me.  Also there are not enough drills for the attributes.  There's a shooting drill but it will not improve 3 pt shooting or Free Throws, developing a back to the basket game is completely useless because 9 times out of 10 the player is not good enough to make the necessary amount of shots to even upgrade.  The dribbling drill has always been dumb, with that weave through cones nonsense.  Strength, shoot in traffic, ball security, passing (a whole nother paragraph) and many more attributes cannot be upgraded via drills.  It's just dumb.  This results in manually editing players and you know how that goes with 99% of people lol Dwight Howard will turn into Hakeem Olajuwon on offense.Well I still don't like the player attitudes.  Way too often everyone thinks they should start.  If I have Joe Johnson at Shooting Guard, no other shooting guard will start over him unless their name is Wade or Kobe.  Far too often, these rookies, bench players, bout to retires, and journeymen will grumble about playing time where there is no way to check them unless it's through more playing time or a trade.  We need the reality check option and should be based on the coach's rating and accomplishments.  Players with a 73 rating thinking they should be starting over my 90 SG get out of here.  This also hurts when trying to build a solid bench.  It wouldn't be so much of a problem except it messes up team chemistry and lowers the rating of the player.  The coaches don't progress.  So if the team makes the playoffs 5 years in a row your coach will still be a D, assistant coaches still cannot be promoted to head coach, and coaches 10 years in the league retire for no reason.Also the season tasks are limited once again.  Win the division, make the playoffs, etc. are nice milestones but what about a team leading the league in scoring or in defense?  What about a player leading the league in rebounding?  Win the regular season series against your rivals, Win one playoff series, Win two playoff series? Hold Kevin Durant under 25 pts...etc. etc.  These things could add more development points at the end of the season for development of players but now as it's structured only the good teams and their players get better.  What about Kevin Love?  Can he get some development points playing for the worst team in the league?  Probably not.  And once again at the end of the season I should be able to send Josh Smith to shooting camp and rebounding camp or as many camps as I please.There's a few aspects of gameplay that I want to address as well.  The first is the very awful passing system.  I understand that players must make smart passes and all that good stuff.  However, I saw more deflected passes in 5 games of NBA 2K11 than I have in an entire season of watching NBA on TV.  It borders to the point of ridiculousness.  If an NBA player can't pass from the wing to the post, or from the high post to the wing, or from middle of the court 3 pt line to the wing then they have no use in the NBA.Passes on fast breaks are too often stolen while the computer completes the same court length pass on their break.  The simplest passes get stolen or tipped and most of the time it's horse booboo.  But the computer is throwing alley oops with Dwight Howard standing right in the paint.  The same pass that gets stolen 98% of the time for you the computer makes that same dumb pass and converts it. The game also has the weird habit of bypassing a player.  For example I have Dwight on the block.  Instead of passing it to Dwight you will send a cross court pass across the lane and several defenders that will end up getting stolen.  I should not have to icon pass to player standing right next to me.The fast breaks are pretty bad as well and it's something they haven't gotten quite right since...well...ever.  Players frequently (and I do mean frequently) get caught from behind on a fast break.  Two on ones are impossible because of the horrible mechanic of passing and the unrealistic percentage of tipped passes.  A two on one will probably be stolen by the sole point guard back to defend the fast break or he will body my 220 lb SF running full speed.  Also players leading the fast break still run to the 3 point line for no apparent reason when only the trailers should be running to the three point line.  The defensive fast break is even worse because even though you've gotten back to prevent the fast break the computer still completes the pass through 3 of my defenders en route to a layup or dunk.  A lot of times the first one back will run away from the basket for no reason allowing a computer player to get a layup...it's just crazy.  They will be standing there defending the basket and then just move for no reason as soon as the opposition comes.The last gripe is that players change directions slowly when you have them but are as fluid as ever with the computer controlling them.  I can't even halfway show a double team without the ball being kicked out to a wide open player and my player unable to change directions like he's stuck in the mud.  These are pro athletes they can change directions quickly.  I could see if it was like Dirk Nowitzki or somebody but a standard NBA guard should be able to show a double team and get back at least in an athletic motion.  Also after a pump fake and the defender is in the air it's nearly impossible to just run right by them without them making an unrealistic recovery.  It's to the point of ridiculousness.  The defender jumps and before you can even take a dribble he's back on the ground and recovered.Another thing, Andre Miller is not unstoppable.  When he goes 4-4 from the 3 point line and 7-7 from the field hitting runners, one leg off balance jumpers and fade-away jumpers on Superstar level then something is fundamentally wrong with the system.Also the speed of some players is just ridiculous.  Why John Wall can't outrun centers on the court is beyond me.  It seems everyone is the same speed with the quick guards having an extra burst.  John Wall, LeBron, Tony Parker etc. need to be way faster and noticeably faster than Al Horford.**2K has opened a whole can of worms with the historic teams and players.  For the next game it should be a way to unlock these players and then throw in a few more of the outstanding players such as Reggie Miller, MVP Allen Iverson, young T-Mac, MVP Shaq, young Jason Kidd, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, young Larry Johnson etc. and have little challenges to unlock those guys too like score 100 points in a game, score 11 points in 45 seconds etc.**","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"J.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Anniversaries are never this good","reviewText":"1996 marked the arrival of the first, and highly influential, Tomb Raider, which introduced gamers to the Indiana Jones-esque heroine Lara Croft and marked one of the finest examples of true 3-D gameplay at the time.  After a number of years, as well as a number of unremarkable sequels that really downplayed what the series was about in the first place, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos marked a return to form with last year's Tomb Raider: Legend, which brought the core gameplay back to it's roots.  Now, to celebrate the release of the original Tomb Raider over a decade later, we get Tomb Raider: Anniversary, and be glad for it.  A re-imagining of the original game using the Tomb Raider: Legend graphics engine, Anniversary finds Lara in her usual environment: various tombs scattered in exotic locales.  While locating artifacts and gunning down baddies, you solve puzzles to progress through the game while engaging in some inventive platforming and acrobatics; all of which leads up to quite an explosive finale.  There are plenty of new elements to go along with the classic gameplay, including a new adrenaline dodge and challenging, multi-layered puzzles.  The graphics and textures look pretty good for a late in life PS2 game, and yes, Lara herself looks great as well, but there are a few noticable hiccups, especially noticed if played in Progressive Scan mode.  That aside, the rest of Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a smashing homage/remake of the classic first installment that is surprisingly pretty flawless in it's delivery.  Whether you are a casual or hardcore fan of the franchise, you should definitely consider picking up Tomb Raider: Anniversary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2007"}

When I wrote my first review for this game I had not beaten it yet.  But now that I have finished the game I feel I can offer a defense for the game.Yes it is a fairly short game.  But really why does that matter?  Would people rather have a game that's endless hours of boring game play (Dark Angel comes to mind) or a game that is not very long yet offers a compelling story line, fantastic gameplay and top-notch voice acting?  There are plenty of games that you could purchase that would be longer in playing time, but not hold a candle to Soul Reaver 2's quality.  And isn't that what we want as gamers, quality gaming?Sure I wish the game would have been longer too, but that shortcoming doesn't make me wish I never purchased the game.  The story line is so incredible that it ranks up there with some of the best games I have ever purchased.  Yes Soul Reaver 1 was a longer game, but how many people got tired of the Drowned Abbey section of the game, or the pointless finding of the glyphs (they really had no bearing on the game).  Soul Reaver 2 has less wondering around and gives you better direction on where to go and what to do.Another knock on the game that I have read is that it is too much watching and not enough playing.  I can understand this, but the story line is the driving force behind Soul Reaver 2.  It's answering questions that span 2 previous games and tying in all the story lines.  Which by the way they do fantastically.So in my opinion this game is not a waste of your (money).

They lack the depth and replay factor of the sports title that comes with the wii.  They are more involved, however, than the mini games of wario ware. They are right in the middle.Many reviews seem to think this game is going to serve as a sequel to wii sports.  It's nothing like that game, and I think people who are expecting that level of complexity and fun are in for a rude awakening.  For example, don't think the table tenis game will be as good as the tenis sports title because it isn't and doesn't try to be.  It's a mini game.  The laser pong is fun, though, and the duck hunt game is a great blast from the past, as is combat.Of course the big issue is the extra remote.  You get the remote and game together for $50.  Is the wiiplay game worth $10?  Absolutely!  (I mean, it has far more playability than the Xbox 360 burger king games for a similar price point, plus without all the corporate propaganda!)For all the naysayers talking bad about this game, I think they miss the point of it.  This is a great $10 title.  If it were packaged at that price as a stand alone without the remote, I'd buy it (and any similar sequels they'd release).  At my house, we play the sports title as a party game on the weekends, and this game will serve the same purpose.  You and your friends will have fun with 2 person multi here (I know, no 4 player, but come on, ten bucks remember?), or even just passing the remote around and trying some more truly innovative wii gaming here--just wait until you play the cow race mini game with your friends gathere around!Bottom line is, remotes are harder to come by than Wii's during this initial wii release.  If you can get your hands on this, you're silly not to get your hands on the remote.  This is a game you should get right now.  Don't wait.  First, for that remote, and second, in a few months, the novelty of the wii remote will be getting stale, and there will be better games that make use this awesome technology.  If you get the game now, though, it'll be great fun while the system is still fresh.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2007"}

After hearing numerous previews, and getting a good pre-order deal, I went for it.  This is not a perfect game, but it really is a lot of fun, and that's what I buy games for.I know most reviewers like to measure framerates, graphic comparisons, etc...I'm not big on that level of tech talk, but I can tell you the game looks and plays great.  I played through it once, and spent a lot of time online, and it has never frozen or even stuttered.  I didn't play the last two COD games, so I don't know how evolved it is from the last one, but as a game on it's own merit, it is a very good game.  There is a storyline that runs through all the missions...basically, the missions reflect some top secret missions occurring during the cold war era, in places such as Cuba and Vietnam.  Not revealing too much, the general plotline borrows a bit from the Assassin's Creed series; an unknown group is going through your memories from mission to mission, trying to get to certain information.  Some of the missions get a bit frustrating, but not deal-breakingly so.  There are a couple of levels where your next goal wasn't as obvious as it could have been, and this can be frustrating, but this doesn't make for a bad game, it just takes it from being a great game to being a very good game.  The controls are very smooth, and very easy to pick up.  There are a great deal of different weapons that you will use, which does a lot towards keeping the gameplay fresh.Though I haven't played the last couple of COD games, even I know that the multiplayer experience is really the focus of the COD franchise.  I'm not a fantastic FPS player, but I have spent a long time on that mode, and have really enjoyed it.  There are several different modes of play; you start with team mode, a mercenary team mode (players are randomly assigned teams) and a free-for-all mode.  Playing more and more of the game unlocks other modes, weapons, maps and contracts.  Contracts are basically goals within the game...beat a certain number of people using a certain weapon, for example...which you purchase using COD money earned by playing the game.  Meeting the goal wins you a certain amount of money from the contract; missing it obviously costs you whatever you spent on the contract.  There are wager matches, where you bet on the results of matches. There are special modes like One In The Chamber, where you start with a gun with a single bullet.  If you kill one of the other players, you get their bullets.  Otherwise, you must rely on melee weapons.  The progression of multiplayer really encourages you to play more and more, to unlock all the modes, weapons and other bonuses available.  This is really what brought me to get this game, the variety of gameplay available in multiplayer is huge, and will likely be about the only online FPS I will be playing for quite some time.  I am really not very good, but the matchmaking and gameplay variety have made it a real blast to play.  There is also a training mode for those of us who haven't done a lot of multiplayer games, or just want to familiarize themselves with the game before heading online.  I think this is a great addition to the game; hardcore players may never venture into it, but to others of us, it's a great training ground.Maybe my favorite mode is the Zombie mode.  Basically, you are locked away in a certain area, and must figure out how to accomplish some goals then get yourself out of there.  Zombies are coming at you with gradually increasing vigor, and you must deal with them.  Every time you kill one, you get a certain amount of points.  Points are not just a part of your score, they are used as currency.  It's up to you to decide if you want to spend your points on new weapons, upgraded ammo, or using them to open up a new area.  Do you hang out in a certain room, picking off zombies and running up your score?  If you do, you will hit the harder areas, with tougher, faster, deadlier zombies, so be careful how you spend them.  Make sure you finish the main single player mode at least once to open up a hilarious zombie level!This game has come with a ton of hype, and has already become one of the best-selling games of all time.  Don't let that sway you either way.  I have enjoyed this game a lot, there are tons of things to do, and s.  I would really recommend anyone with an interest in this game give it a try...but it, rent it, whatever.  I don't really have the basis of the last two games to guide my opinion either way, but on it's own merit, I think this is a very good game that is definitely worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Pure fun, without all that \"morality\" getting in the way","reviewText":"Infamous and Prototype were released at almost the same time, and, naturally, comparisons between the two started to fly. In the end, neither game came out on top, but the same cannot be said for their sequels, in my opinion. I purchased and played through Infamous 2 first, so know that I am qualified to say that Prototype 2 is far more fun.Before I go over the story, let me start by saying this is not a kids game. Nothing about this game is appropriate for children. Everything from the combat to the language to the subject matter is very much adult. Your character, Sgt James Heller, is a former marine who goes after Alex Mercer, star of the previous game, looking for revenge for the death of his family. Mercer defeats Heller, but instead of killing him, turns him into something like him. The story is your standard affair, but still manages to be engaging.The characters in Prototype 2 talk like real people, in that cursing is very much part of their vocabulary. If you are averse to strong language, stay far away from Prototype 2. Personally, I found it refreshing to hear characters talk like people really do. There are no heroes in this world. Heller is out for revenge, pure and simple. He may stop people from doing bad things, but that in no way means that he won't do bad things himself. This is an aspect that I find superior to Infamous 2.In Infamous 2, your character is a blank slate until you choose between \"good\" and \"evil\". In Prototype 2, morality isn't an issue. you want revenge and you are going to get it, any way you can, and that is where the fun kicks in. From the get go, Heller can jump twenty feet in the air, run up the side of a building, glide to another, and then action star karate kick an enemy soldier across the horizon. As you grow stronger, you can choose which abilities you want to grow with you. If you put the premium on getting around town, upgrade movement. If you're having trouble with the fights, give yourself more health and regeneration. You can upgrade your character to suit your personal play style, and it works wonderfully.You will get out of this game what you put into it. If you want to fly though the interesting, and engaging story missions, you are free to do so. If you dig a little deeper though, there are hours of game play to be found. From finding black boxes scattered across the city, to sabotaging your enemies movements, to a few interesting mini games, there is a plethora of things to do.The Combat is fun and fluid, but not as precise as I would like. This isn't really the games fault, but more a side effect of the fact that modern games feel the need to be \"accessible\". Gone are the days when not being able to beat a level meant that you had to try harder. Finishing moves are executed with a single button press, but as the game progresses and the screen fills with dozens of enemies, expect to grab some random zombie and impotently chuck them at the wall instead of finishing off the wounded enemy that has a precious ability upgrade. This isn't a big issue, but it is present.Overall, Prototype 2 is a grown up game with a lot to offer. Tons of fun, hours of game play and a new game plus feature adds replay value, and the story is compelling enough to keep you playing long past the time you promised yourself you would stop. Highly recommended and a definite buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2012"}
