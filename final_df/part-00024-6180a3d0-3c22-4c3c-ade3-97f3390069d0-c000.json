{"product_name":"B002EE1P2W","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Bearcat","summary":"Fun killing zombies but a few annoyances","reviewText":"Deadrising 2 is about two things, zombie killing and getting your daughter Zombrex so she doesn't wig out and turn into a zombie.  There are other things thrown in like a game show and rescuing people but the real plot line is about finding out who framed you for letting the zombies loose and getting your daughter zombrex.So what is fun about this game?  Killing zombies with all the combo weapons you make!  You can combine nails with a bat to make a devastating weapon, combine a bucket with power drills, and on and on.  Pretty much anything can be used to kill zombies from a beach umbrella, to a protestors sign, to a wheelchair...it's pretty much almost anything.  While the zombie killing is fun sometimes when you are in missions and you don't have a mode of transportation (car, bike, etc.) it seems to take forever to get to where you need to go and dodging zombies gets a little boring.  You can't just walk and kill all the zombies as that would take a looooong time for you to get where you are going.The story is interesting and the game has somewhat of a grand theft auto feel at times as you are going on \"missions\".  The online multiplayer is actually more fun to me than the single player game.  You hook up with three other people to compete on the gameshow in a set of zombie challenges.  Sometimes it's sniping zombies, sometimes it zomboning (crushing zombies on a zamboni then spewing their blood into a target) or it is plowing through zombies using chainsaws on a motorcycle.  These games are a blast to play with others and you can cash in your winnings to use the money in the single player game...which can really help.  The co-op play is a lot of fun as well since having a partner makes for all kinds of fun zombie slaying.The only downsides here are that sometimes the zombie killing or running to destinations can be a little monotinous.  The story won't win any academy awards but it serves it's purpose.  Overall a fun game but not as good as the best PS3 titles that are similar (i.e. uncharted 2, infamous, etc.).  If you don't own an xbox 360 and have never played this game I think it would be a fun purchase for most people.  The multiplayer along makes it a blast in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"Camila \"Lally\"","summary":"Great Tatical Shooter","reviewText":"I usually don't buy tactical shooters because they are too complex, but R6V2 called my attention because of the co-op component. After playing the demo for the first game I decided to buy this one and have been pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is solid and the A.C.E.S. system is a good new addition. My only complain is that so far I've had the game slow down on me several times which causes a severe framerate drop and audio delay. This is frustrating since I die often as a result and to fix the problem I have to turn off my Xbox 360 to continue playing normally. Other than, that this is a great game and I highly recommended it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"Gamblor","summary":"Excellent Sequel","reviewText":"This quick sequel to R6V is great; it offers more of the same (a good thing), but the devs listened to some criticism from the first game and it plays out much better. In my opinion, the story missions are way better than the first game - it's shorter (the co-op campaign can be completed in under 5 hours), but it's a more intense affair. The locales are decidedly different than the first, which provides some tactical variety. The co-op is second to none due to the actual cooperative elements in the environments (multiple entry points, cover tactics). The only thing dragging this game down is the crappy matchmaking. Whay aren't we using a party system yet?!? The multi is a blast to play, with tight, choke-point centric maps, but having to search for every game and then play with random people in a sparsely populated map half of the time is unforgiveable. If you have a buddy to play co-op with, this game is a must-buy for action fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2008"}

Nevertheless, with companies that've fizzled like Sega, and Sony's recent debut with the PSP, there is just so much to look out for, especially from Nintendo. Since the late 80's, their Game Boy has been the main trademark as one of the most successful, and the highest-selling video game system of all time. Yet, it also has gotten better with so many different improvements. Yet, while Nintendo is equally conjuring status with their DS handheld, the Game Boy still is a favorite.The Game Boy Advance SP with the Peral Blue color, is a unique and compact device,  that can play all different Game Boy Advance greats like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario World 3, the mini-game madness of Wario Ware: Twisted, and newer favorite like DK: King Of Swing. It is easy to carry, and cost so much less for anybody who wants a game system. Not only that, but you can also play earlier versions of Game Boy classic games like Kirby's Dream Land, Tetris, and  Super Mario Land, as well as Game Boy Color games like Pokemon', and others as well. Yet, so many others are considering ther DS and the Game Boy Advance Micro as other considerations as hanhelds because, of their quality and games instead. While those are great, for anybody who owns those earlier Game Boy Games, you won't be able to play them on those handheld games systems, just here.Anybody who loves games will defnitely want the Game Boy Advance SP. This is a great game system, and I love it because it is so affordable, and everybody loves it. I honestly recommend this handheld over the many others.

{"product_name":"B000QUYHIK","reviewerName":"Eagle Vision","summary":"Fun game for your intellect","reviewText":"The predominant genre of games that interest me are the \"Brain Games\".  The game is organized in 4 sections: Quick Play, Daily training, Sudoku and Dowload.  You can save your profile to monitor your progress - which can be performed graphically.  With each task, there are instructions from a prompt on the \"monitor\" screen of the DS.On Quick Play, you can do a \"Quick\" Brain Age Check, Training or play Sudoku.  This game allows the user to notify the game, whether he or she is right or left handed.The \"Brain Age\" concept is unusual in that the ideal brain age for this game is 20 years.  Some people never develop beyond concrete thinking, and some people develop abstract thinking in various stages.  I don't believe in the 20 year Brain Age as ideal but in this case, it is an arbitrary determination to set your goal to achieve.The various games are simple in concept; however, the level of difficulty increases as you progress, and you perform the tasks against the clock.  Examples of games include unscrambling words, math problems, matching symbols, playing the piano, and memorizing numbers.Each game or task takes about 2 to 3 minutes to play (except for Sudoku) and this is great for when you have a little break to get away from various tasks during the day.  Over time, the stimulation of your mind will help you focus and concentrate.Sudoku has a simple concept, as you already know, but the game is addicting in itself.  You are allowed 5 errors but are penalized for time if you make an error.  This is one of the best parts of the cartridge.Most of the games use the touch screen and the built in microphone.Overall, this is a great game to excercise your mind.  Bear in mind, if you don't use it, you lose it.Highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2009"}

I loved the unique style of the art in the game. This game employs very cool use of color techniques in the art direction.  This adds to what the player sees while moving through the game, but also is true to how the game insinuated that the character has an almost 6th sense for where to go.  For example, certain paths are highlighted in a way in which the character (you) sees a glowing red door or certain wall paint.  This not only looks cool, but also helps point you in the right direction.  It can also get confusing sometimes, because many things are left ambiguous and the correct path would make a normal human being think twice about jumping over a chasm so large.  Instead, you find yourself falling to your death so many times because you either misjudged a gap or went the wrong way because the correct way seemed obviously ridiculous to attempt.  Towards the end of the game, the art direction really pays off and the feeling of the city finally comes alive when they offer a night scene.  Too bad there wasn't more of this.The music is a mix of ambient techno.  This works and fits the futuristic, police state setting of the game very well and can be often catchy. If you want it to be, you can relax, enjoy the scenery, and explore around until you get bored.  The music picks up and slows down depending on what's happening in the game so it all fits.  The other sounds don't really impress so much.  You are always linked to some guy telling you information and he chimes in while you are trying to pull off delicate maneuvers or he calls you and starts talking while you are actively engaged with enemies or frantically scurrying around to escape. I hate when games do that; have conversations when the characters are getting the stuffing kicked out of them.  Much of the story comes through this way and you end up missing out on what the heck is going on because someone just told you their life story while you were tight-rope walking over rooftops with machinegun wielding killing machines chasing you.I also love the genre of the game: a first-person platformer.  This is a breath of fresh air from the been-there-done-that shooters that saturate the market. It's similar to what would happen if you blended a Prince of Persia-style game with a 1st person shooter, although there is very little shooting to be done on your part.  You are just there to run, jump, and climb around. This is also how the game tends to fail.You will repeatedly die in this game.  Much of this game requires trial and error to get through this.  You will fall to your death countless times or the G-Men that never stop coming after you will either corner you and shoot you down when you get stuck finding your way around, or beat you up when you try to take them out up close.  So many sections require perfect jumps and cat-like dexterity.  The sad part is that the developers of the game seem like they think that falling to your death hundreds of times and staring at a load screen is great fun.  It is not.  Pulling off the cat-like maneuvers isn't as satisfying as it should be. I was anticipating the game's end which is a first in a long time playing games.  It's pretty frustrating.The combat in the game is nothing like what it tries to be.  The game's loading screens display a silhouette of your character disarming and taking these guys out with smooth ninja-like motions.  Unfortunately, each time I ran up to a lone enemy, I would have to simply stand there and wait for his gun to turn red before I could press the correct button to snatch it away.  After that, the game takes over and dispatches the enemy for you.  It sounds simple, but the timing has to be perfect and you have to be standing in the correct position in order to pull it off. It's much easier to run up to a lone guy and mash the L2 button until he falls down.This game has a tendency to seem very lonely.  Sure, you have some guy giving you mission objectives and pieces of story throughout the game and faceless armed killers showing up to gun you down, but you always feel very alone through the whole campaign.  The entire game is an obstacle course, but you never bump into or even see anyone else.  When you crash through a door an some building, you never see office workers jump up in their cubicles to see what's going on or anybody observing you run through any of the games areas.  It would have been nice to include people as another obstacle for you to overcome because it seems to drab otherwise.Overall, this game was fun, but I had trouble getting addicted to it.  Once I beat the story once, I had no real inclination to play through again if it weren't for the time trials and trophies.  Even then, I am tempted to shelf the game in favor of something a little more engaging.  Because of the low price and the unique style offered here, it is definitely worth a look. I would actually love to see what they might do with a sequel and hopefully see more activity from other people walking around in the city.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Winston Fraser \"Arcade Bee\"","summary":"PS2 is still great!! but this could have been better !!","reviewText":"I kinda!!!!!! liked it at first then more than 2 stages into this game,i started to get fed up of the repeatitive meaningless gore , bad camera angles and horrible gameplay if you like it you don't know what a good game is!!!!!!!!!!! then try ninjagaiden (xbox )then tell me whats wrong with this boring trite excuse for a ninja adventure or did i dog the story line???????????????????? its pitetic but!!!!!! what do i know i live in a third world country , Trinidad!!!!!!! some how we know hog wash when we see it, have a good time playing a bad game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2005"}

The only problem with this is there are time, which you have to control the team and multiple vehicles. This can be annoying. The graphics are good, but not quite as great and animated COD4. The characters and their uniforms are very detailed. In fact, they look better than RB6V. There are also some real-life features on the game, such as being able to hear wildlife and rocks falling from caves and trees blowing, after a grenade blows. The gunfights are pretty cool, much like RB6V. I like RB6V-2 because it is more tactical. I like to have close quarters and long distance battles. There are a few flaws in the game. The most notable flaw is the reloading. While the character is reloading, he moves his hand and everything. There is the clicking sound, as if the clip is being changed. The problem is that the clip never comes out. This is sooooooo irritating because it is not realistic. How can they have such a flaw on a PS3 game? This is not PS2, Genesis or Nintendo. They definitely need to fix that on the next game. I have not been able to play online because it is hard to get into games. On the CODs, at least a player can get into a game, despite coming in late. Other than that, the game is pretty good. It is definitely worth buying..........for its low price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Wow what an improvement","reviewText":"I beat the original Battlefield Bad Company a few years back and to say the least I wasn't impressed. This sequel is a huge improvement over it's mediocre original. The campaign is a lot better this time around. The story is very well written, and has a lot of mystery elements in it that adds to the fun of playing the game. Bad Company is sent to destroy a weapon of mass destruction. The campaign has many twists and turns as you try to find the device and kill the bad guy. The Company themselves this time comes off as more adult and not like children like in the original. There lines are much funnier and better written. The campaign does lead very well into the inevitable Battlefield Bad Company 3 while still having a nice conclusion in itself. The campaign is rather short though. It will only take you five or so hours to trudge through it on normal difficulty. The destruction in the game is beautiful along with the environment. Bad company along with it's surrounding is very detailed. The grain that saturated the first Bad Company is thankfully gone.  The uniforms and guns especially look very realistic. I do think that the destruction could have been easier to use. A grenade does nothing to walls, but guys can shoot through them. I hope in the next game it will be easier to blow the buildings up. Don't get me wrong you can blow anything up it's just that you have to work at it.The campaign has some flaws other than the Frostbite engine. There were a few too many boat scenes, all the enemies look the same, and the frostbite scene was just a little out of place. None of these hurt the campaign too much, but they did hurt it a little. In the beginning you are on a boat a few times, but not to kill enemies just to go to the next area, and it seemed like a waste of my time. The frostbite mission was also very strange. You have to keep moving into buildings so you don't freeze to death. Felt more like Lost Planet then Bad Company. The enemies themselves was probably the biggest distraction out of those three. The AI only has two uniforms, either a flak vest enemy, or the beret one. Just a tad annoying to kill the same Daniel Craig lookalike every time.The online this time around is very impressive. These maps are huge. I do wish they had more of them at launch, but more are being released all the time (for free). You can either choose medic, engineer, assault, or recon while playing on line. You can change at anytime, but you only get points for that class when you are using it. I have sunk about 15 hours into the online and I am enjoying myself. You have squads of up to four people that are a part of the overall team. This allows you to work as a team better. You squad may decide to hold position A while another will hold position B. It's more personal and easy to interact when the teams are split up into smaller groups. Also when you die you can spawn on anyone from your squad which puts you right back into the action. All the damage and vehicles from the single player are in the multiplayer. Nothing is more satisfying then taking a building down with the enemy inside it. It does take a long time to rank up though. I'm only level 8 after 15 hours and I have no idea how high the ranks go. Thanks to the bigger maps sniping is actually doable, unlike in Call of Duty where your running around in a small cage. In Battlefield you have an entire football field to conqueror. It's much more strategic this way because running in and taking the flag yourself is most of the time impossible. You have to work as a team to win not as individuals.If you are buying this game for the campaign I would suggest you rent it. The campaign is solid and very enjoyable, but it is rather short so just barrow it for a couple of days instead of buying it for sixty dollars. If you plan on also playing online then by all means I recommend this game be on your shelf. Battlefield Bad Company 2 really showed what some hard work and determination can do in creating a great sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2010"}

The game preserves the original 1997 graphics but an all-new game engine delivers the most detailed visuals seen in the series to date. In addition to worldwide online play you'll also get an opening movie and cut scenes that feature never-before-seen episodes from the characters' pasts and answers to some of the questions raised in previous titles. There are more stages and costumes than ever before, 7 different modes of online play and the highest number of battle stages seen in a Dead or Alive game to date.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"In a word? Fantastic!","reviewText":"Dead or Alive Ultimate is a compilation of Dead or Alive 1 and Dead or Alive 2, each on its own disk. Dead or Alive 1 is an exact replica of the same game that was released on the Sega Saturn so many years ago. This is a really nice treat because this might be the first time that players get the chance to play the game that started it all for this series. Since it is an exact replica the graphics remain the same, so players will be playing with more \"boxy\" polygonal character models. It is amazing that even though this game has changed so much it still feels the same.The arenas in this mode are a riot. The rings are composed of two squares, the inside one is \"safe zone\", so if you fall down or get knocked down to the ground, the only damage you take is from the force it took you to get down there. If you go outside of this zone, the rest of the arena is what I like to call \"lava.\" What I mean by this is if you get knocked down on this part of the game, your life will get deducted by how much force it took to get you down there plus once you hit the ground you will be knocked upwards, like a volcano blast, and you will receive more damage. Since there are no walls to get cornered, players will always have to be aware of where they are located so they don't take additional damage. If you want to play online with Dead or Alive 1, you will be able to. All you have to do is sign on and get your \"fight on.\"The main focus of this compilation was placed on Dead or Alive 2, and it will become apparent when you first boot up this game and see the intro CGI movie. This game looks better then Dead or Alive 3, which became one of the benchmarks of the graphical power of the Xbox when it was released. This game truly shows the power of the Xbox. The character models look just as good as the CGI movie, which looks awesome itself. The clothes on the characters move and have their own set of physics that move realistically as clothing might be expected to if you are fighting someone.The most noticeable thing is the arenas that the characters fight in; they are a jaw-dropping awesome sight to behold. Every level there is some interactivity involved, from things going on in the background, breaking through walls and going to new parts of the level, or little subtle things. There is always something going on in the background, in one level you will be fighting in a chained off arena, and ever so often there will be cops chasing cars throughout the level, which gives it a very surreal feeling while you are playing. Just like in Dead or Alive 3, there are many different \"levels\" to particular arenas. One of my favorite is on the snowy mountain. While you are fighting through the level you can make the snow move around, and if you get the person close enough to the cliff you can knock them down to an icy lake below. From there you can even knock the players into icicles and make them shatter. This is truly a sight to behold.The subtle things throughout each level might be the hundreds of leaves or cherry blossoms that are floating around the level, get stirred up if you walk through a pile of them. While this might not seem like much, you will have to remember that each of those leaves have a polygonal count and move throughout the level while you are performing a beat down on an enemy. All of this is going on without any slowdown, how remarkable is that!  It is literally amazing all of the details that went into making this game look this great, and still remain highly playable without any hint of slowdown.The roster for this game is the exact same as it was back on the Playstation 2. You will find all of your old favorites included with the exact same fighting moves. Some might be disappointed that several moves might be missing that were in Dead or Alive 3, but you will have to remember that this is a remake. One of the biggest draws for this game is the amount of costumes unlockable for each character. Many of the girls have over fifteen completely different costumes, and I am not talking about one costume is purple while the other exact same one is red. The costumes are 100% different from one another, such as School girl outfit, bathing suits, Santa Outfits, to many other things. It will take players a long time to collect them all, but it is rewarding once you have done it.The audio portion of Dead or Alive 2 is great, but could have been better. It features Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, which makes the fights feel more \"alive,\" especially in certain levels such as the one where the cops are chasing cars around the block. The Japanese voiceovers are what one might expect from this game, and fit the characters really well. The only disappointing thing is that this game doesn't support custom soundtracks. While it is nice to hear all of the music from the game, I would have liked to fight with the music of my choice, especially after playing the game for many hours.Here is the part you are waiting most for, the online portion of this game that has been talked about for months on end. Before I get into specific details, I will say that it is one of the best features of the game! As you know if you have an Xbox Live account you can fight anyone across the world and it feels just like they are sitting next to you. There are times when you might have a few fights that are \"laggy\" but they are few and far between. Another thing of interest is when you unlock a new costume you will be able to use it while you are online, so if you see someone using your favorite character with a costume you have not seen before, you will know that it can be unlocked and used for your character as well.The modes that are available online are: Spectator, Winner-Stays, Tournament, Team Battle, Survival, Loser-Stays, Kumite. In spectator mode, players will be able to view the battles currently raging on. In Winner-Stay players fight a one on one match, and the winner of the match will stay and take on the next challenger. In Tournament players will advance to each round until one person is declared a winner. Team Battle, players will be able to challenge other players in Tag-Team Battles. Survival mode players fight battle after battle until their health is depleted. In Loser-Stays, is the exact opposite of winner-stays. Kumite is a non stop battle, in which win or lose a person fights all the challengers until they quit. With all of these modes available, you will not be able to get any sleep as there is so much to do!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Juicy Melon","summary":"One of the Best!","reviewText":"If you have not played this game, then you are hurting yourself.

I found myself wishing that this game was somehow turned into a movie...Actually, it does play out like a movie because the cut-scenes are mini-movies.

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Halo Noir","reviewText":"To start things off, let me ask you, do you like/love any of the following? Bladerunner, Firefly, the Halo series (games and extended lore included), noire film, incredible soundtracks, complete immersion from your video games, unbeatable playability, challenging difficulty without frustration, Gears of War horde mode, a very well told-story with completely likable, complex characters... I could go on and on, but if you like any of those things, then buy Halo 3: ODST right now! This game is the black sheep of the Halo series, but still retains the excellent quality of all of the mainstay games in the universally loved first-person shooter epic sci-fi series.The title of Halo 3: ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) is misleading, because it actually takes place about 1/3 of the way throughHalo 2'sstory, where the covenant find earth and flee after an initial invasion. You play as a whole squad of ODSTs (Omnipotent Deities Serenade Turkeys)throughout the game. In the beginning, your squad is dropping in to take out a covenant assault carrier. However, as the drop pods are entering orbit, the ship enters slipspace and knocks everyone for a loop. You wake up as the Rookie, a completely voiceless character, six hours later in the futuristic city of New Mombosa. It is nighttime, you are alone, and you haven't a clue what happened to your squad, the city, or anything at all really. Finding out is the story of ODST (Ogres Dropped Some Trash). You navigate Rookie throughout a hub world of damaged city streets, taking in the sights of a ravaged city. You also play as his squad mates in flashbacks, unraveling the mystery one tasty morsel at a time. It's exceptional.The story in ODST (Olives Don't Smell Terrible) is absolutely fantastic. I'd say it's one of my favorite Halo campaigns simply due to its unique and totally different approach to storytelling. The characters are brought to life amazingly well by THREE cast members of the amazing television sci-fi western epic hybrid of awesomeness,Firefly. Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk: can you ask for more awesome voice talent for a game? They each do a fantastic job at bringing their very well-written character to life. Nolan North (Nathan Drake fromUncharted) also lends his talents of being smug, witty jerks to the game as well. When you combine the voice-actors, the exceptionally well-written dialogue, and the vastly different cinematic focus of the game, you get one hell of a ride. I am hugely impressed by Bungie.The only problem is that the campaign is way too short. It'll take most about 4-5 hours to finish, 6-7 if you really take your time. I know this game was developed as an expansion sort of game rather than a full release, and if I bought this for its original $60, I'd give it four-stars. Under its current price (one much lower than originally), however, it's definitely worth every penny and a 5-star game.The atmosphere in ODST (Obadiah didn't s*** there) is incredible. I really can't think of enough praise to slather all over this awesome atmosphere pie to do it justice. The nighttime segments are unnerving, pensive strolls through empty, city streets that heighten loneliness and isolation. It feels like a fantastic noire sci-fi fantasy (Blade Runnercomes to mind constantly). The daytime levels are more traditional Halo and suitably chaotic. The art design is some of the best on today's consoles. Despite the agingHalo 3engine, the game looks beautiful. This shouldn't be a surprise, as Bungie always nails the art design and atmosphere in their games. As is expected with a Halo game, Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori have hit a home run with the soundtrack. The direction of the music is unlike any Halo game before or after it, opting more for the soothing, chilling music of a noire film. Once again, I am reminded so much of Bladerunner. Fantastic!The gameplay of ODST (Oh Damn She's Tight) isn't much different from the other Halo games. Since you play as the ODSTs (Orbital Drop Shock Tomatoes), and not as Master Chief, you are weakened a bit, and that does change your strategy a bit. Other than that, what can you say about the gameplay? The Halo series is known for FPS perfection on consoles, and this game continues that trend. The controls are perfect, the weapons are very well balanced, the vehicles are among the best in any non-racing game, and all of the Halo gameplay traditions are continued and refined here. The only wrinkle that is unusual for the Halo series are the nighttime levels, where the focus is on the immersion of being alone in a city during an invasion by the covenant. You feel isolated and lonely during the Rookie parts, with occasional intense firefights. All-in-all, ODST (Oliver Drives Smokey Trains) nails the gameplay. There's even a new mode called \"Firefight\" where you fight increasingly difficult waves of covenant. This is done extremely well, although I was always much more into the story than that.Oh by the way, you get a second disc with this game that containsHalo 3'smultiplayer and every map ever released for it. I realize that most people won't care because they're playingHalo Reach, but if you ever get the itch to play good ol' Halo 3 multiplayer, this is icing on the cake, especially since ODST (Octavius Delivers Steamed Tacos) is so much cheaper now.Halo 3: ODST (Optional Donations Sound Terrific) is an absolutely fantastic black sheep of the Halo family. If you ever wondered what you'd get if you tossed in Blade Runner, Halo, and Firefly into a blender, this is what you'd get, and it's about as awesome as you'd expect. I have to say, this is probably one of my favorite games in the series, and I really love Halo. I've devoured all the games, read many of the books, absorbed all of the soundtracks, etc. I love Halo 3: ODST (Optimal Death Simulation Terminates), and you will too if you get it. It really is a one-of-a-kind, amazing experience. Buy it, immerse yourself in it, LOVE it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"Ho Hum....","reviewText":"I played DII for a long time, on and off, and eventually raised a sorceress up to level 80 something after about two years.  Like any game, it grew stale and I moved on to other things.  I think I would have given the game a four star out of five (with the expansion).  It was innovative for the time, I enjoyed leveling up my toon, and it was fun.  It wasn't the type of game that could keep me glued to the screen for hours and hours, but an hour here, a level there, and for what it was I enjoyed it.Then comes this game.  I guess I was expecting something.. more?  I refused to play the beta, since I think it can detract from the fun of launch and trying a new game.  I anticipated a similar type of experience to DII, however I thought they would obviously refine and update the experience.  I have leveled my main toon up to mid 20s, and here is how I feel the game stacks up:1)  Its the same game fundamentally as DII.  The graphics vastly better, but you are still locked in to an overhead view with high resolutions surroundings.  I was looking for options to change the camera, zoom out, do anything... but they never added any of that.  The environments look good, but its the same as DII - you go out into a randomly generated plane, scattered with the odd monster lair, groups of mobs, fog of war, and teleporters back to town.  You have acts and bosses and lots of loot to choose from.  Its primarily the same thing.2)  They did away with the talent trees and replaced them with abilities you get as you level.  You assign an attack per button on your mouse and then get others you can use on 1-4 on your keyboard.  The good thing is you get access eventually to all the abilities and can choose on the fly which ones you want.  No more placing points into trees where you get 2% more damage for frost spells or getting stuck picking abilities that you later regretted.  You also don't place any ability points - its all on autolevel.  The thing is... I liked the old system.  My build was mine, and I looked forward to that level to place a point, or in three levels will get this ability, etc.  I could map out how I wanted to make my toon.  Now its all automatic and the only choice I have on my dude is whether its a she or a he, the name, and what ability I want to use for whatever fight.  Its much more like a common action game with very watered down RPG elements than an action RPG.3)  Same old grind with your attacks.  I tend to use the same attacks... over and over and over and over.  For me it has gotten stale much faster than I thought it would.  I think that is because its basically DII with enhanced graphics and a crappy leveling system and DII came out 10 years ago.  I played that game to death, and I guess I just expected something more.  The story is very low key and there really isn't much else there.  Its fun to smash mobs over and over or blow them up or what not, but thats all this game really is.  It was more enjoyable 10 years ago because it was relatively new then.  Now it seems almost a step backwards.4)  The Server.  Holy smokes I was blown away by this and is the sole reason why this game gets 2 stars instead of 3 for being just OK.  You have to log onto a server to play this game.  I understand blizz wants to data mine whatever you do online, and obviously protect their product from piracy, but I honestly don't understand why they went this route.  Some people say they wanted to go the multiplayer route more with DIII.  The problem with that is the multiplayer is going into public games and pressing two buttons with a 1-2 other people.  Its ok I guess for about 3 minutes... but then I just left and played my own game.  Others say they wanted to use the online auction house.  A decent idea, but I really don't know how many people will find that all that attractive.  You get loot so fast, and level up, and get better loot that before you know it that rare item you got two days ago is now junk.  Why spend money on those items when in a day or two you will not need it?  But it still boils down to having to log on.  And I still have to wait sometimes to get on because the server is full.  For what in my book is a single player game.  Then I get on... and you get the server restart in 15 minutes BS.. or the game is laggy as heck and your toon jumps all over and it glitches out.  If your like me and just want to turn it on and blast the snot outa baddies for about ~ 30 minutes (until it gets boring), then the whole server thing is just an incredibly over the top DRM system.  I thought maybe the chat thing was something that would make it worthwhile and was treated to Superbubbaz and Cooldoodz23 performing 12 year old wow like trade chat - that was definitely not a positive addition.  I don't see anything they added here thats a bonus and not a detractor.  If a DRM subtracts from the pleasure you get out of the product they put out - that god awful mess for HofMM6 is a good example, then the DRM is a failure.  This isn't as bad as that, but its close.So overall its a two star game for me.  Logged on tonight... went about 5 minutes and just logged out and wrote this review.  Its only a few days old and I feel like I've been playing it for 4 months.  Too bad I guess, I was hoping they would do much more with this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HAC6","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"It's Pretty Bad","reviewText":"This game is just really mediocre, and it ultimately fails at being the one thing Duke Nukem should always be, bad ass. I'm an experienced gamer, but even on normal difficulty I died way too often. I don't mind a hard game, but it never seemed difficult, all of my deaths just felt cheap. This is made all the worse when the load time after each death is around a minute long. That is just unacceptable in a game released in 2011, especially a big name release. This problem is further snow-balled when there are many times that the checkpoints are poorly placed. The deaths felt cheapest in two main situations, the platforming and fighting the octobrain enemies. The light platforming sections featured horrible controls, and too many instant deaths when those controls fail you. The octobrain enemies happen to be worse, and are more difficult than any of the huge boss fights. They attack in packs, 2-4 of them at a time and then sometimes appear in waves. They grab and fire back any rockets and grenades, though for the grenade this becomes the best way to fight them. Their attacks can take away all your health, or around half of it in one hit. Consequentially you will die when you face them, and at times you will have to run and hide multiple times while you wait for your health to regenerate. All of these huge problems are topped off with horrible graphics that would have been mediocre/average for the original Xbox.The whole game is stupid and immature, but that's what you want in a Duke Nukem game, in fact I would have loved even more goofiness. I would have loved more original and funny weapons than the current loadout, and only being able to have two weapons is just stupid for a game like this. It consists of a very basic handgun, shotgun, light-machine gun, rocket launcher, automatic grenade launcher, and two semi unique freeze-ray (sucks, especially when you can only carry two weapons) and shrink-ray (awesome but very limited ammo). I would have loved to see cooler guns, like the weapons in Bulletstorm except cornier. The regenerating health doesn't work well for this game, a bad ass should never have to hide and run away from enemies waiting for your \"ego\" to be restored. I would have liked some sort of health pack system much better, or even something to give more meaning to the ego bar. Something like random Duke related swag (magazines, action figures, movies) that would refill his ego after having it drained by being filled with pig lead. I also found it annoying how to increase your ego bar you had to play poorly made mini-games, especially when the increase was barely noticeable. The story makes absolutely no sense, but all you need to know is that the aliens are back and you have to kill them. The bosses were also very generic, though none of them were horrible other than the underwater worm thing. The whole underwater level really sucked, even if you ignore how all the weapons work exactly the same, the controls were too floaty :). Add to that having to worry about running out of breath and strong attacks from the worm without any sort of spring/fast-swim mode the boss fight gets very frustrating.Ultimately, I had to play this game to satisfy my curiosity, but after I was done I wish I'd never picked it up, though there is some fun to be found in this game if you look hard enough.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0030MQPQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Brings out the 9-year old Tron geek in me again...","reviewText":"I was excited to pick this up as a new entry in the Tron universe.  Tron 2.0 was interesting, but deviated (in my mind) from the true Tron experience by turning it into a first-person shooter (the original Tron wasn't about guns!).So how does it fare?  If you're familiar with Mirror's Edge and Prince of Persia for traversing your environment as well as God of War for combat, you're in familiar territory.  When I say God of War, I use it quite loosely as the combat in God of War is quite visceral and visually stunning whereas Tron utilizes more stilted movements and variations on a single weapon (the disc, whether it be the disc bomb, etc.); there are combos, to be sure, but not overly creative compared to God of War.  The game is not ground-breaking, but instead draws upon familiar themes.  You'll feel at home.  Other Tron-signature moments occur in the game in the form of the Light Cycle and the Tank. Both are very well-done and are \"true\" to the movie interpretations.Some reviews that I have read online complain about the rather bland aesthetic as well as some game play elements (the tank is a \"slow, lumbering\" vehicle).  If you're not familiar with the movie, then you won't appreciate that the game designer's attempt in keeping in line with the actual Tron universe.  If you're looking for a phenomenal, game-changing ride then don't look here.  It is, as I've mentioned, a parkour-style game with a rather basic combat system that pays homage to the Tron geek in me more than it does to develop a game that is mind-blowing in and of itself.  It's a step above the traditional movie tie-in, in my opinion, although you may find others here who will disagree.How is the story?  So-so.  It definitely does the movie justice by giving you a backstory behind Clu's fall from grace (this isn't a spoiler; Flynn's program Clu has been mentioned in many articles) and your role as a System Monitor program (\"Anon\") that attempts to help Flynn/Tron in bringing balance to Flynn's computerized vision of data management, The Grid.  Bruce Boxleitner actually provides voicework for Tron (a quite welcome nod) while Olivia Wilde, who plays Quorra in the movie, also lends her vocal talents here.  Together with yourself, Anon, you attempt to unravel the source behind the latest viral attacks by the mysterious viral program, Abraxas.The story is basic, the gameplay is basic...yet I can't help but love it.  The 9-year old in me who saw the original Tron back in 1982 appreciates this chance to go through a single-player story adventure on my own or duke it out with up to 9 others in multiplayer mode.  Thanks, Propaganda, for working on this!If I could, I would give this game a solid 4.4 stars.  It doesn't quite deserve a 4, but certainly not a 5.  However, given that it currently averages 3 stars, I can't bring myself to drag it down...and the Tron geek in me fully appreciates what's been given to me.  For a reduced price, I would definitely give it my whole-hearted recommendation for those willing to try something new...at full retail, however, I'd say wait for now; don't disappoint yourself if you're not fully committed to enjoying Tron in the first place.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}

I played Veronica X and dabbled with one of the original ones on the original playstation, and that was about it. But Resident Evil 4 will blow you away.First off, the graphics are fantastic! I bought this the other day and on my day off watching my newborn son, I decided to sit down and play for awhile. Yeah... Awhile was an understatement. My wife got home, asked what I did today and I had nothing... nothing to say except... Resident Evil 4 was fun.This game will scare you. I don't care if you think it won't. It will. I think it's because it builds tension so well. You arrive in a remote community in search of the Presidents daughter and are quickly subdued into the carnage. After you explore the first house, you'll realize how cool of a game you are in.You can slide a dresser in front of the door so people can't get it in. (This is a good idea). You can dive through windows to escape. You have new weapons and the controls are fluid... although you still can't RUN and SHOOT.  You can Run.... stop and shoot... but you can't run and shoot.  That is the only thing I can complain about.I'm not gonna give plot away because half the fun is finding out all the twists that Resident Evil 4 has in store, but I will say... that this is unlike any Resident Evil 4 game you've ever played.Gone is the stiffness of previous Resident Evil games. You have an open environment to explore. Explore how you choose. There are puzzles, but not overwhelming puzzles... this game is mostly about scares and violence.Choose the right time to use your shotgun... sniper rifle with scope... rocket launcher... incideniary grenade... and of course the mystery weapon that I'm still working to get.In Resident Evil 4, you also have to collect jewels so that you can buy goods from the merchant dealer who is a shady character himself. The first time he walks by a window when you're walking down the hallway and says something to you... you'll wonder if you should go or not.Oh... and if you hear a chainsaw? RUN like hell.

Another Nintendo ploy to make money by slapping Mario's name on some sport.  But, once again, Nintendo makes me eat my words.  To put it simply, this game is pure hectic, frenetic fun.  Essentially the basics of soccer are present, but this game is more about slamming your opponents into electrified walls and throwing bob-ombs or shells at them when they're out of your reach.  Then slamming them into the electrified wall.  I know, it sounds too violent for Nintendo's Gamecube, but it's true.  And it's every bit as fun as it sounds.  Don't worry too much though, moms, because unlike real soccer, no one ever gets hurt.  And the craters on the field disappear eventually. (Once again, not kidding.)  Having played soccer myself, however, I was afraid that these unorthodox tactics might take away from the experience.  They don't.  What they do, however, is succeed in making Super Mario Strikers one of the most fun Mario sport experiences available.  And if you have friends you're in luck, because this game only gets better when it's a real live person you're slamming into an electrified wall.  Seriously though, this is a great party game and is surprisingly deep.  Combining items with your various moves make the more strategic player really able to dominate those who simply hit the \"slam opponent into wall\" button over and over.  The only drawback of this game is that the frame rate occasionally slows, especially when you use the unlockable team.Bottom Line:Great, fast-paced, enjoyable game; you'll especially enjoy the multiplayer experience.  If you own a Nintendo Gamecube and have enjoyed, or think you would enjoy, a Mario-themed sport, then you need to get this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2007"}

Bearing all that in mind, this one -- Tomb Raider 7 -- is the first geezer game in the series.  By that I mean, you can pick it up, play for 20 minutes (about all you'll need to finish Bolivia), and put it down for hours.  The controls are deceptively easy -- Lara's DEFAULT pull-up move to handstand was an Easter Egg in Tomb Raider 1 -- and aggravatingly hard to unlock if you have OLD hands and slow-firing reflexes, but truth to tell, I'm not sure you'll need them.  The technical merits put forward by Crystal Dynamics shame everything Ubisoft has ever tried to foist on us.  True, Lara is now anatomically incorrect in even subtler ways -- her MCL is impossibly thick, as though she has a mutant knee with muscle where human knees have only ligament.  As well, she now keeps several pet eunuchs in her mansion, and has serious issues with hot gothic blondes who may or may not generate sequelae.  So, yeah... I'm not very sanguine about the future of this series, which shot its wad when Chronicles came out, but if fans can clean up the \"Lara Croft is a subset of entertainment\" mindset, Lara Croft can still rock.

So, EA is stepping into the shoes where Call of Duty has gone so far and so well on the 360 and I must say that my impressions are mixed.i will keep this brief because most reviews have touched on a lot of key points of the game1. Graphics - I don't think they are as good as CoD but still as with any other WWII game you know you are in a fight. But it's at the point now after seeing games like Gears of War and Stranglehold one has to wonder when will there be more destructable environments? I mean come on...we are 2 years into the next gen and there should not be so many static objects!!2. As good as any WWII shooter can be...on a decent set up it sounds like there is complete chaos going on around you. Still tho with large explosions, my subwoofer could use a lil more of a workout.3. Controls - handles pretty well altho I wonder why there is no prone feature.4. Game design is very innovative.  Having the freedom to drop into a zone as opposed to making a linear run from point A to point B increases the amount of thought you have to put into finishing an objective. Pay attention to your briefings because they are no joke. Think you are going to land near your objactive and finish it right away? WRONG. I tried that twice and had my butt handed to me as soon as I landed and I do mean getting beaten and shot at before I could raise my weapons. This idea is a refreshing way to play because you won't complete any one level the same way...also it gives you ways to startegically plan an attack? Having a hard time mounting a frontal assault? Try looking for the back door or try taking the roof...there are more ways than one to take out the enemy. The AI is pretty sharp and they will find ways to take you out and sometimes it seems cheap too but again you won't Rambo thru this game.My only minuses so far are these:There are times when you seem to feel like you are completely on your own, this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending...and sometimes when you are fighting with others some of those jokers will step right in front of your aim.When shooting an enemy, sometimes it seems like you have to empty 1/2 a clip just to kill one soldier...again...this is next gen guys, if I shoot a guy in the arm he should be hurt...leg make him limp..head...he should not get up ever again...but on this game they do...Just when you think you are done, there is more....this could be a plus or a minus depending on who you are talking to...but as soon as you are done one laundry list of objectives, a new list may pop up tacking on another 1/2 an hr of the level....this could work as this game is rumored to be rather brief.All in all this game so far is cool, Call of Duty definently has the crown in WWII shooters and it's almost sad that this year's iteration won't be from that era but that may be a good thing, but if you like WII shooters and need somethig a lot less linear, MoH is worth a look.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2007"}

They could have added so much more variety to differentiate the disparate stages of hell, but the way it was done, you just run from one stage to another and only know you're at another sin because of the cheesy cutscene or because your guide to hell tells you so. There is something to story-telling which is lost in this game, unfortunately. The puzzles are some of the lamest I've come across in awhile. The boss battles are what you would expect. The graphics are pretty good at times and then not so other times. Controls are tight so at least it's got that going for it.

And I could not wait to play Pacific Assault.The graphics were very good. The main problem though was that I couldn't turn everything up (I have a P4 2.8, 1gb ram, 128mb Geforce fx 5200 video card) or this game was extremely laggy. It was even worse on-line. I can only imagine what it would look like with everything turned up.The sound was very good. Everything sounded life like and with headphones on it was eveb better.The gameplay was excellent. I did hate the levels trapped in forest. It seemed like a  1/3 of the game were levels like this. But it also made it different from all other WWII FPS games. It looked nothing like those other games. And when the Japanese soldiers started losing, they would banzai charge you. There were a couple of levels where they just kept charging and you wondered if it would ever end. And you didn't pick up health on the ground like the other games. You had to wait for a medic to heal you and your buddies, but he could only heal you so many times.The levels outside of the jungle though were the best and most of the missions were solid, action packed, and very intense. This game was almost as intense as the Call of Duty games.As for the on-line side, it wasn't very good. The choice of servers isn't very good and there weren't alot of those that seemed to have people playing. Some of the maps I had seen weren't designed very well and I couldn't find anyone playing the objective based servers. It was all deathmatch. I haven't really spent much time playing it (been playing Counterstrike Source, Half-Life 2 death match, and Tribes:Veangeance), but hopefully more people and servers will show up and there will be chances to play it. But then the game is also very laggy (I have a DSL connection at 3Mbps). I guess I will have to get a new cpu to keep with next generation of games.Overall, I give this game a good rating as I was really wound up playing this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Some great ideas but FFXIII strays a bit too far from the norm for most","reviewText":"I can literally say that this was the first game I had ever put a pre-order in for, as I love Final Fantasy but was mainly out of the series during the PS2's life cycle.  Now that I had a PS3, I was eager to get back into it, and when I saw one of the trailers for the game, I wasn't sure if I was watching a game or a movie!Final Fantasy XIII reminds me of two other FF's in particular:  FF8 and FFXII.  That being, this is in the \"love it or hate it category\".  Each one of those games radically departed from what FF was, and it really split down the middle from those that swore by them and those that traded them in lightning fast.I have not completed the game (I'm in Chapter 9 at the moment), but I feel I've completed enough of the game to give an honest to goodness review, I'll take each category one at a time:Graphics: 10/10There is simply no doubt in my mind that this is one of the top 5 graphically sound games on the PS3.  Sometimes it is REALLY hard to pay attention to a battle or a scene because you are way too busy looking at other things.  Square-Enix put together a masterpiece that will be really, really hard to duplicate in this area.  From the Eidolon summons, to even the basic spells, to the towns and areas themselves, all of it is simply incredible.Accessibility:  8/10One of my biggest worries is that in missing out on FF's 10 through 12, I'd be totally lost in this new battle system.  Nothing could be farther from the truth (and well, having the strategy guide didn't hurt).  However, if you've never played anything past FF6, this definitely would be a shock to your system.  Using your Paradigms properly and at the right time is absolutely critical or you will not advance.  On the other hand, there are enough recovery items/character balance that you can make it through the early chapters without a ton of trouble while you are learning.  Overall, and this is most important, while it helps to have some FF background to pick up all the \"fan service\", this is a completely accessible game on its own without having played FF before.Sound/Music: 8.5/10The sound in this game is great, as it should be on the PS3.  All the appropriate bells/whistles are there.  I especially think the voice acting is spot on (though to some, Vanielle is going to seem just a *bit* annoying).  The music, at least to this point, hasn't been much that I would remember unlike themes from FFIV, FFVII and FFIX.Gameplay:  7.5/10I for one slightly agree with those who say making this game \"on rails\" and taking the town aspect out was a mistake.  There was always something neat about roaming around, going to a new town, and finding out what those people would say/how they would help you.  I mean, that IS Final Fantasy, all the way back to the NES.  While it does work, it also removes a lot of what FF is/was.  I think the battle system is done very well, but I think upgrading is really confusing when it comes to weapons, and you'll definitely need a FAQ and/or the strategy guide to make the most of it.  FFXIII also discourages what is usually a staple of the series, and that's level grinding.  Sure, you can respawn and kill enemies, but in any one chapter, you can only advance your character so far.  Eventually you'll max everything out.  On the plus side, you CP points do carry across all, so no need to play with a character you hate just to get through a certain section.But I think the one gameplay departure that makes things really bad is the \"on rails/linear\" style that makes up the majority of the first 10 Chapters.  At least in every other FF I am familiar with, you can choose your party at least 1/4 of the way through or just a little later.  To make players wait until nearly 2/3rds of the way through the game to do the same subtracts a lot IMO.  For example, I would have loved to put Lightning/Snow/Hope together earlier in the game.  Can't do it...until middway through Chapter 9.Replay Value:  9/10.  There are several things to do once you finally do get to the open part of the story, it will probably take most players around 16-20 hours to get to that point, but then things really branch out in any way you would like to go.  To complete everything is probably a 60-80 hour excursion, more if you insist on upgrading a ton of weapons/accessories.Final word:  Square-Enix stepped out of the mold and took a bold chance with this game, which in Sazh perhaps created the most memorable FF character of all time.  But some of the choices (on rails, removing towns, etc) are simply too drastic in the opposite direction, and the gameplay has changed enough that it will turn off certain groups of FF Fans.  However, the fact remains this is still one of the best RPG's on the PS3, and if you've never played FF before, you should give this game a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Great game but could have been better","reviewText":"This game is divided up into two parts: 1. fighting and 2. cut scenes. When you're not fighting, or running to a fight, you're watching a cut scene. After you complete a fight you're given a number of CP. You use CP to level up and gain new abilities. The problem I have with it is that most of the enemies in the game offer so little CP that it takes FOREVER to substantially level up. Each character has three main roles. But there are roadblocks for those roles and the game will stop you from leveling up at a certain point. You have to defeat a boss in order for more areas to open up. At a certain point in the game, all the other roles will open up and you can level up in them. The problem is, every single new ability costs so many CP that it will take you HOURS of fighting monsters to get anywhere. For instance, it'll offer an additional 25HP for your character but it'll cost you 31,000 CP to get it and the most an enemy will give you is 4,000 CP. So it's really frustrating.The other thing that really annoys me with this game is you have to level up your weapons and armor too. You do this by applying the items you get from battles to them. But the weapons and armor both upgrade using the same items and in order to to upgrade fully you need to use A LOT of items. So by the time you fully upgrade one weapon, you have nothing left for the rest of your weapons and armor.Last big complaint, you can only control one character. In a battle, the other characters can die and you can bring them back. But if YOU die, it is game over. I think, if your main character dies, another character should step in to take his or her place. I have never had so many game overs before in a Final Fantasy game. I miss the days when you could swap characters in and out.On the plus side, I really did enjoy the battle system. You have to in this game because that's pretty much all there is. When you finally level up enough, the battles look awesome.The storyline is very good. I became invested in all of the main characters and cared about each of them. I do wish that more time was spent on the supporting characters. The main villain could have used more time although I do think he is memorable. Certainly more memorable than FF12's villain.The music is great at times. The rest of the time it's forgettable.The graphics are astoundingly beautiful! Even after playing Uncharted 2, I was blown away by the IN-GAME graphics. Just wait till you reach Gran Pulse. The level of scale, the number of enemies, and the level of detail in each and every single thing is amazing. The enemies actually look like animals living off the land and not just mindless drones walking back and forth. And the enemies range from tiny to GIGANTIC! And all this without any slow down on the PS3.I beat this game today and I will probably never play through it again but I do feel it was a fulfilling experience. It's not my favorite FF game but I do think it was a great one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Carlos E. Coto","summary":"A month of PS4","reviewText":"After officially of owning the ps4 for a month, I am ready to write my review.Update version: 1.52.The ps4 is sleek in its design and had no trouble upgrading it to a 1.5 terabyte hard drive. After my initial fears of getting a bad product, everything has been working well. The blu-ray player inside it seems to be a bit faster than the ps3 version, and the image looks great.The User interface on the ps4 is easy to use and seems to be a major improvement over the ps3's XMB. Since I don't have that many games, they haven't become a cluster on the UI as of yet. One thing that I do love is the fact all the video apps are on one area in which you can look at everything. I hope that Sony does that for the games as well so they make the UI without much cluster.One weakness of the UI however is the blandness to it for now. I hope updates are made to it so it looks better. The music is nice but can be a bit annoying after a while to some users of the ps4. I however, got no problems with it.The game install times are fast on disc. It installs within 30 seconds to 1:30 seconds, depending on the game. Each game requires an update which you need to start the game for it to download. You can't play online without the updates, however you can play while it downloads. Once it finishes, close the game app and once it finishes installing, go back to it and game away.The playstation store seems to be faster here, comparing it to the ps3, but it doesn't have many things to buy as it still needs to be updated with newer games. It lacks content as it came out a month ago yesterday. The playstation plus system is great for those who have a ps3, ps4 and/or vita system as it gives you free games (rentals) beta invites, and online storage for your saved game files. This month, they gave away contrast and resogun. Good indie games that can keep you entertained while the newer ones come out next year. If you do want to play online games however, psn+ is needed, but you can still use netflix, hulu, vudu and all other media services at no additional charge since they are not behind a paywall.The controllers have changed quite a bit from the ps3, adding to it a sleeker design and better grips for the hands. Not to mention a touch pad and changing where the start and select buttons would be, which are now called Options and Share.The Option button works as a pause button for games giving you direct access to the options menu where you can change the settings of the game, as well as other options given to you within the game. The share button gives you 3 options while you are gaming, giving you a way to take screenshots, upload videos and a streaming option via twitch tv and Ustream. Lag may occur on the streamings depending on your internet connection and bandwidth.The flaw I see with the controller is the battery life, and only one cable is brought within the console and extra controllers do not bring a charger. The good news is any micro usb will work with the controller.So your own cellphone chargers for android phones could work (so long as they are micro USB.).Voice commands can make the system work well for you if you bought the camera. Supposedly the headset mic can be used for that as well but I haven't tested it. Sometimes the voice commands do get wonky but it works well to take screenshots without the need to hit the share button.The wi-fi internet connection on the ps4 seems to have improve from the ps3 settings. I would always have issues with the ps3 on the wi-fi settings, but the ps4 seems to respond better. Though I would recommend keeping it wired for better connections.One final note would be the remote play. It works well in certain areas when the system is close as there is no lag within what you are doing on the console to the tv. Similar to the wii u's second screen, the vita can be used as a second screen for the ps4, or to play the game through it, without the need to hog the tv. It works wonders in a concrete house. However, the touch screen can be a pain to use in certain games.Freezes and bugs are common for a console and I did get one glitch in the system yesterday while quitting the movie Turbo from the system. It just stayed there with the loading circle on the screen. Even trying to turn off the console didn't work. I had to go in manually which I do not recommend under any circumstance. One good thing is, if the console shuts down unexpectedly or not in its usual way, you can report to Sony what happened through the ps4.Overall I have had no truly bad experiences with the ps4 as of yet and through one month of solid gaming I have enjoyed it very well. I give it 5 stars. However for any normal consumer, given the fact that it did froze on me once, and some things don't work too well because of updates needed as well as some tweaks, I give it a 4/5.Should you buy a ps4 right now or wait? I would suggest wait until the psvita/ps4 bundle or until more games are out there. If you have a ps3 or an xbox 360, both consoles are good enough for now and are still given support so no need to truly jump into the next generation unless you wish to do so.Hope this review helps everyone and happy gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

Controls seem more precise and the combat can be a lot of fun. Graphically the game is 100% better than the already attractive first installment, and one of the better looking games I've played on the 360. Sam Witwer again reprises the role of Starkiller and does a fantastic job, as do most of the voice actors (though many of them don't get a chance to do much.)The bad is pretty much anything and everything else. This is one of the shortest games I have ever played, and I've played a lot of games. An experienced player could probably do this in about 4-6 hours, and anybody that's not very good still won't get 8 out of it. There are 4 (four, IV) levels. Let's take a moment here. This is a 60 dollar game with 4 (four, IV) levels in it. So, I'm not really going to go any further into that. They are rather long, but you know, it's just...well, yeah.The story is disastrous. There's way too much going on, except none of it gets developed. So there's not really anything going on, just a feeling of jumbled and rushed trips to planets and familiar characters. All of the growth into a good person that Starkiller did takes a step backward in this one, as he selfishly searches for Juno Eclipse, almost totally disregarding the Rebel Alliance that he started! Kota was in the game, but other than saying \"boy\" a lot he wasn't much like the wise old Jedi I remembered. Proxy has about four lines, and I'm not sure if he beats out Juno in the dialogue department. Boba Fett and Yoda do appear in the story, but if you've seen the trailers featuring them, you've really seen all they have to offer.The story (if you will) ends right where it seems it should get interesting. It feels like you're playing half of a decent game, and then halfway through it just stops. No ending, just a crappy set up for future DLC and a third installment. Which means I paid 60 dollars for a 4 hour half story that makes no sense, and I have to spend more money to see if it even goes anywhere.Now the game was fun, I did enjoy playing it. I just think it's a rental at worst, borrow at best. The fact that I spent $60 dollars on this disgusts me.I'm usually a big Lucas fan, but you know how everybody jokes about Lucasfilm just being a money whore, with no interest in quality or content?In this case, they are right.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2010"}

This was new. Before, most races were pretty much carbon copy, with a few differences but largely the same. Starcraft had every single unit of each faction be different. Every single unit.That was a risk, and a pretty big one at that. It could have failed. Instead, it succeeded spectacularly, and is why Starcraft is rightly judged to be a classic.Then Blizzard took a risk with Warcraft 3's design and got burned. In many ways Warcraft 3 improves the RTS genre and is better than Starcraft 2, but gamers don't always reward innovation or change.Starcraft 2 is an evolution of Starcraft 1. There is nothing wrong with that, but risks weren't really made. Blizzard isn't a scrappy upstart anymore. Instead, it is a lumbering and conservative giant.And it is better-balanced than Starcraft 1. The game is as tight as ever. there are some creative tactics available (though not as creative as warcraft 3).The noticable improvements for me are:reapers, basically little jetpack dudes who can jump over barriers and pack a big punch (though they stink at receiving punches)Vikings. Very unique unit that is good AA and can transform to a ground unitvoid rays. devestating when used right.infestors and burrowing roaches. interesting use of stealth that fits in zerg lore.The downside is that it is largely the same game and most players will just mass either roaches, marauders + marines, or stalkers to attack the enemy.the price is also very high. The expansion pack costs $40 which is on top of the $60 I paid for this game. They are getting greedy.The SP campaign was good though, one of the better RTS campaigns I've played. They were perfectly balanced and there's a nice little RPG progression scale built it.yes, it is worth getting this game.

However, the game developers need to get busy. There are very few must have titles even though the promises and rumors continue to claim each year will be THE year.

The screen is large and bright and makes movies a joy to watch while traveling or sitting on public transit. The built-in wireless adapter and the software makes network connectivity simple.

Work your way through five evolutionary phases, including Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization and Space, that offer unique challenges, thrills and goals. For example, you can start in Cell and nurture one species from a simple aquatic organism all the way until it becomes a sentient life form. Or you can jump right in and begin building tribes and civilizations on multiple planets. What you do with your universe is totally up to you.The powerful creation tools of Spore are easy to use, allowing you to effortlessly design every aspect of your universe. Creatures, vehicles, building and even starships are all within your grasp. While Spore is a single-player game, your creations and other players' creations are automatically shared between your galaxy and theirs, offering a nearly limitless number of worlds to visit and enjoy. You can also go online to view the incredible things other players have made and can even pull those items into your universe. Spore gives you the chance to make worlds and beings that evolve, grow and delight you every step of the way.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Multiple Installs and Gameplay Issues","reviewText":"Spore is an innovative game from the creator of the Sims, which lets you take a creature right from the one-celled amoeba type stage all the way through space flight. It has great potential, but also can be very frustrating.(...)So finally I had Spore installed. Now to start playing! In cell mode I wanted to be an herbivore. Big mistake. While there are lots of enemies around to eat if you're a carnivore, and an omnivore can eat anything, a poor herbivore can only eat plants. Once those plants are gone, you're pretty much doomed. Everything wants to eat you. I found out quickly through trial and error that an omnivore was your best bet. A few \"upgrades\" later, and I was moving on to creature mode.In creature mode you take your same basic cell shape and move up onto land. Again, it became apparent through several replayings that plant eaters had a rough life. You want to be an omnivore so you can eat your enemies when you find them - and also fall back on plants if you're surrounded by things too tough to attack.On you go through the higher levels, and the game morphs along to let you build tribes, gather food, get space flight. At each level you switch to a new set of skills and have to learn new gameplay.I really love the idea - but I wish the game carried more over from level to level. When you go from cell to creature level, you are left with a bunch of \"useless body parts\". You need to in essence completely redesign your creature for the new challenges.Also I wish the game did not seem to heavily biased towards omnivore. Maybe they are trying to teach us a lesson here :) It is only through an equal balance of aggression and pacifism that you can survive.I definitely find this game to be a time sink, and can lose myself in it for hours. However, compared with other games I play, the time does not pass in a \"stress release\" fashion. For example if I play Halo or Age of Empires or StarCraft or other games I get caught up in them, have a lot of fun and feel quite happy when I'm over. Most of the time when I'm playing Spore I'm feeling frustrated with the enemies, stressed about finding more food, and annoyed that my people are off migrating or being attacked by wild animals and needing help. It's a \"demanding\" game. I love challenges and tough opponents - but it shouldn't be stress inducing.I'll give the game a 3/5. It is certainly fun in a way, and I give it a ton of credit for being innovative. However, the evolutions could have been handled far better, the balance on each particular level could have been much more even, and that copy protection scheme is just awful. I only have Spore installed on my laptop and this is the first time I've ever had to do that - do a single-system install because I am afraid of running out of reinstall options once I switch machines. I shouldn't be in that situation with a game I paid for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ3M","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"Mature content isn't always good*; an informant review","reviewText":"When I completed the first Prince of Persia video game, I felt that I had acutally accomplished something rather challenging and fun, the gameplay and graphics in the first P.O.P. was indeed a sight to be hold with its share of flaws, the storyline was straight forward and didn't try to hide itself behind large words that have smaller rephrases if you catch my meaning. In other words: \"The sands of time\" Needed not a sequel because the ending felt as though it had completed the story in and of itself (see; Van Helsing).I thought The first game was absoultely great, but the sales for the game were sadly, not what UBI-soft had hoped for; but they should've expected that, the USA is in the middle of a war with Iraq formerly known as \"Persia\", and the prince is indeed a Persian, there aren't many people who like Iraq (I'm not pointing fingers or being racial), most of the US population does not like Iraq or its people, because they believe their the cause of the war and possibly 9/11, in my opinion.So when I heard there was going to be a sequel, I wasn't jumping for joy. The Gameplay is no major improvement, the prince still does most of his usual attacks and wall running although there were tweaks and new attacks/moves put in the game, the puzzles are tougher and your bound to get lost within the dark laybrinth of the island the prince is on, there are boss battles, and as far as a story goes, its mot much.Ten years after the first game, the prince is on the run from his so-called fate because he was supposed to have died because he released the sands of time, so in order to save his life he embarks on a quest to destroy the sands of time before they are ever created, thus stopping his ever opening the hourglass that started the entire mess he's in. During this time, the prince meets two scantly dressed women in red and black, who either want to kill him or supposedly help him. The prince's new look and darker persona is anythiing but appealing, they don't even keep the same voice actor that used in the first Game.\"The Warrior Within\" is basically a game spawned from Sales tatics: The violence, blood/gore, swearing and mild-nudity, and suggestive themes is simply UBI-Soft's tatical plan to draw \"more\" sales because the first one didn't have as much as they'd hoped, as I said before. Which is a sad thing in their case, because the Mature content in this sequel is a sign of despration. Now, I'm not complaining, I'm simply giving you my opinion. If you're going to buy The Warrior Within, then expect major changes and overkill in some of the content. [--- No rating]","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2004"}

The second instalment offers nothing really new but managed to fix all the flaws in the first game, perfecting the art of this title.Kingdom Hearts II continued with what's left behind in Chains of Memory on GBA. The plot thickens as you started off the game with an all new main character. It is also because of this that you can see other new Final Fantasy characters popping up in this new environment. This offers you a whole new surprise for the game.The story is well written and it gives you twists and turns here and there to keep you going. Things that you thought were explained popped up in a way that you noticed that they were never actually resolved. This is the same for the story in Chains of Memory. Haven't played the first two games? No worries, Square-Enix had written the story in a way that provides tons of flash backs to bring you up to speed with the chronology of the Kingdom Hearts world.In terms of gameplay, the battle system is more or less the same as the last one but with some new and minor updates. Now you have limit breaks and overdrive gauges. Veterans of Final Fantasy games will immediately notice that these are ideas from Final Fantasy VIII and X. Once unleashed with these commands when conditions are met you are rewarded with an extravaganza of battle combo. Also this time round, you have an option of not just going out hack and slash but deploy a more tactical approach in battles. The trigger command using the Triangle button allows you to employ battle related tactics response that could help you speed up the battle with context related attacks. This works for both random battles and boss fights. So you have an option of scarificing your X button all the way or use a more tactical approach to battles, which I think is pretty clever. The summon system is back and worked exactly the same way as last time round, though you will have new summons and some of them are actually hilarious than useful. The menu system is still not that friendly when it comes to battle despite you can have a quick menu to assist in battle. However, commands related to overdrive and limit breaks are still limited to menu driven and since battle is real time, it sometimes become pretty chaotic if you are not familiar with the menu.The moogle synthesise shop is back too and so is the battle arena. The weapon system is a mixed of traditional Final Fantasy game and the Final Fantasy X ability system. So you have to think about how you want your characters to be. The abitlity system remains the same - which is similar to the ability system in Final Fantasy IX.Another big improvement is the troublesome camera angle that plagued the first game. Remember how you swore in the battle with Ushula in the first game? The enemy is huge but the camera is stuck most of the time. The camera angle this time round are more flexible and Square-Enix have fixed most of the problems. The battle with Hydra proved that they had spent quite a bit of time dealing with the problem. However, when you have Beast in the party, he sometimes blocks your view and because of its size, the camera is sometime locked, which could still be frustrating.The Gummi Ship is back and now Gummi Ship battles are more interesting cos you have different areas that actually show differences. Also, you win new prints by winning those battles, which gives you some incentive to do them.In all, Kingdom Hearts II is a well balanced game that fixed a lot of previous flaws and improved upon the franchise's formula. It is a good game with a very gripping storyline. New areas that are added in this installment provides huge incentives for you to carry on with the game - remember to say hi to Johnny Depp when you see him in the game :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2006"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player.

It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Fingerprints of a Masterpiece","reviewText":"Greetings Amazonites.Alan Wake has the fingerprints of a masterpiece on it, but the game itself falls short of such a title.  There are moments of incredible immersion, story-telling, and action; there are moments where the game is clunky, cliche, and downright silly.  Overall, it's a rewarding experience that could easily have been one of the best games ever.  Read on for a breakdown of some positive (+) and negative (-) points.(+) ENVIRONMENT: the graphics and sound in the game are good.  I'd say they are great, but you can see some minor graphical funkiness and lip-sync problems; these aren't a big deal, but perfectionists might have a problem.  The game world looks great--downright spooky at night--and really surrounds you in the world.  The music and sound effects are great and play at the perfect moments to keep you in suspense.(+/-) GAMEPLAY: this is a mixed bag.  The mechanics in combat are pretty good: use a light source to remove shadows from a bad guy and then blast him with a weapon.  It works, it creates tension when there are multiple enemies, and the variety of light sources and weapons seems just about right.  The movement is okay; sometimes the camera gets in the way when navigating areas and jumping.  There isn't a lot of variety, and that's where it gets weary at times.  The light-shoot tactic is the same throughout the game; sometimes it takes longer with different enemies, but the basics remain the same.  Driving isn't too bad, but it's definitely not a driving sim.  There are also some pointless sequences that require you to push a button repeatedly--like pushing a cart out of the way (why not just use the stick to move it rather than button mash?).  Overall, the gameplay is good but not exceptional and does little to separate itself from the pack.(+/-) DESIGN: there are several elements to game design that need comment.  The levels are linear and there is little in the way of finding secrets or exploring; there are little areas where an obvious side path is present to follow but even those side paths are one-way.  There is only one way to finish a level or find a way through a region.The story is exceptional but gets too choppy and unfocused.  The tantalizing mystery really keeps you playing and wanting to see what happens.  The cut scenes, voice acting, and so forth are really, really good.  I'm not a huge fan, normally, of story driven linear games, but the pacing and narrative here was excellent.  Then you come to the last chapter... while it was good and gripping, the ending made little sense to me.  Maybe it was intended as a cliffhanger, but the scene fell apart as the story wrapped up.  This is a great weakness; a good story needs to be more cohesive and wrap up loose ends.  I understand mystery and cliffhangers, and the need to keep it open for the future, but I also want the story to make sense and I want to feel fulfilled when I play through and finish.The game is fairly short: there are 6 chapters and each chapter should take no more than 2 hours to finish.  The upside is the game seems paced well and this time seems about right for this style of game.  The downside is the game time really doesn't measure up to a full price tag.OVERALL (3 stars): Alan Wake is worth a play.  It has a good story that ultimately falls flat at the end due to loose ends, plot holes, and unexplained events.  The action and narrative pace keep the game going solid throughout.  The environments are fantastic and the characters are interesting.  The length of the game warrants a lower price tag.  I'd recommend picking it up for a discounted price, but I don't see it as a game of the year or other legacy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

The tracks--located in global centers such as London, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco--are incredibly detailed, adding a thick layer of realism to the course. The cars are just as nicely rendered, each shining with the gloss of a fresh paint job and driving with the appropriate responses for its particular style. Those looking for a game with speed to match the hardware should add this racer to their list of Xbox must-haves.","reviewerName":"punkviper","summary":"A lot more variety than your average racing game","reviewText":"So many people were desperate for Project Gotham Racing to be the &quot;Gran Turismo killer.&quot;  Well, it isn't the first to be saddled with that hope, and won't be the last.  My advice, don't try to compare the two.  Both are successes in their own right and both are quality titles.  But, if I were forced, I must give the edge to the PS2's Gran Turismo 3.The best thing about Project Gotham is the variety.  Turismo has a marked tendency to get stale after awhile, but both games require a lot from the gamer to get full enjoyment.  This is not a game for those with short attention spans.  It's all about style in Project Gotham, and after awhile you will be wishing you had some, because chances are your best ain't quite good enough.There are relatively few &quot;levels&quot; in Gotham, but each is sectioned off into different portions depending on what the object of the race is.  Sometimes your objective is to finish first, sometimes to finish a lap under a certain time, other times it is to get above a certain Kudos level.  Kudos are achieved by utilizing impressive driving techniques during your run, like long power slides around corners, overtaking other cars, riding on 2 wheels, turning 180's, etc.  The tough part is being able to show off enough style to rack up Kudos while still finishing the race in a reasonable amount of time.And this game is not easy.  You start out with relatively small, unimpressive, measly cars which can get you to the Bronze level of the various challenges.  From there, the more challenges you complete the more cars you unlock.  People have complained about the lack of &quot;cool&quot; cars at the start, but let's not forget that Turismo limits your initial spending $$$ to the range of Mazda Miata or Plymouth PT Cruiser.  But it will take some time before you get around to unlocking the mean machines.Personally, I like this game.  Anyone can smell a poor-quality game coming a mile away, this is NOT a poor-quality game.  It does demand a lot, and I think that is where many will criticize it for not being user-friendly enough.  And let's not forget that this is simply an updated version of Bizarre Creations old Sega Dreamcast game, Metropolis Street Racer.  Gotham is leaps &amp; bounds better than MSR, but some of the old gameplay gripes still exist.So don't judge MSR on the Turismo scale, and have some patience with it.  It is a rewarding experience eventually.  It's just a shame that many will trash it in frustration before reaching that point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2001"}

I do think it has a decent songlist but just a decent one at best. Many great bands like Iron Maiden (best band ever!), Dead Kennedys, The Mars volta are missed.-The graphics are only marginally better than the first. This is disappointing since this was supposed to set new standards for the series. I do praise their attempt though.-MAJOR Lag problems in some songs if you have it playing through a home theatre set-up. (you can fix this though)-The Battle of the bands mode feels VERY unneccessary and tacked-in-at-the-last-minute. Granted, it has some cool features, but I wish it had more.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Flawed but still enjoyable","reviewText":"One of the first Kinect titles I purchased was Rise Of Nightmares, a daring, gutsy adult title which tries to mix horror elements into one of the first human controller FPS's. It barely gets away with it in all its corny, cheesy glory, rich with it in every trickle of blood this charming title spills.The storyline goes, you play a character who survives a train wreck with his partner Kate. Kate is missing when you become conscious, and your mission is to claim her back. Abandoned in a strange area with other survivors, you're conveniently trapped within the confines of a huge mansion and its walls, the host of which an insane doctor obsessed with death and mutilation. Zombies are a common enemy and the player will pick up weapons which range from axes to garden shears, in order for the game not to be over and for you to find Kate.The plot is very over-the-top, in the B-movie style. The main villain is just nuts, severing limbs as he goes for fun (\"why not?\") and mutilating people while alive. What is certain; RON is not for the weak of heart. There is plenty of adult content here which exceeds the usual blood and guts of other zombie titles. There is emphasis on pain and suffering and it delves into regions of suggested rape amongst other things.The controls seem very stupid at first, but they *do* become easier and more intuitive the more you play. Once you understand the nature of the controls the game gets more enjoyable, but to begin with I was ripping my hair out. Most important; remember there is a walking stance and a confrontational stance. Whenever you engage an enemy, lift your hands up and your target is highlighted, you will then be able to block and see blood and gore which is not yours. There is no strafing available, but to give you leeway, in general enemies are not allowed to attack from all sides at once.The variety of opponents is fun; there are enemies which can only hear, requiring you to be completely still as they walk past. Others include a banshee that wails, requiring the player to cover his ears as he wanders. There's a lot of bosses in this game towards the end, and they come in quick and frequent succession in the last third, but should not be too hard for the player to devour once they understand the combat mechanics. Bosses are usually just quick-time events, get them right and you win.The experience only lasts 7 or so hours, and throughout most of that time you will be dying a lot, redoing sections, breathing sighs of relief as you finally nail that impossible section. One thing I found is the game was very easy towards the end, possibly because I was used to the controls by then.Definitely recommended for any fans of horror, and definitely one to buy if you're interested in how an FPS might feel on Kinect. RON is an enjoyable, but flawed Kinect experience.6.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

The base unit on their 2.4 ghz line just stunk up the place, I spent hours adjusting positions and everything to get a clear, non-interrupted signal to no luck.I constantly upgrade my router to the latest tech but have been going the dual band route for the better part of the last few years so I was sort of skeptical on the addition of the 5ghz band on the xp400 but after trying it, I was pleasantly surprised, it worked like a absolute charm.  My current router is the top of the line asus rt66u that just came out and I have mutliple devices residing on both bands so I am asking quite a lot of the the xp400 but so far, I haven't gotten one interruption, it's been flawless.  For people in my boat, it's worth a try, the new base seems considerably better in tech so far.As far as flaws, I would say just like the other models, the bass is extremely underwhelming as compared to other companies.  That hasn't changed, it's still the same speakers.  The xp500 had a lot of buttons on it, I can imagine people complained about that.  The xp400 has a more streamlined approach but a few of the buttons have been moved to the base which was silly in my opinion.  The surround angles button being on the base just didn't make sense to me.  The xp500 had RCA jacks which was nice as you could hook up a system thru the optical wire then go RCA jack from the tv to listen to tv thru them.  While possible on the xp400, it involves getting a RCA to 3.5mm adapter.  Conversely, the xp400 has the xbox360 transmitter included where the the xp500 required an additional purchase.  Only other difference is the xp500/px5 had preset and configurable sound modes that aren't on the xp400, but those sound modes where so pointless and horrible sounding, it just not a flaw to not have them.I also have a Logitech 2.4ghz headset that has always worked flawlessly regardless of router being used.  They are more sound isolating so the sound is much more immersive and bass heavy but as others have stated, the turtle beach line really does do the high frequencies to a level of quality you just don't get in other sets.  End of the day, it's a pick your poison.  From a technical sound standpoint, the speakers in the xp line can't be matched on the wireless sound front.  On a 'I need a punch' standpoint, there are a few out there that really do it much better.  End of the day, it's a preference.  I love sound isolation for music,  but for tv and games, I think prefer not to have sound isolation so for me,the xp400's are the best wireless gaming headsets on the market.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"A step down from Lament of Innocence? Sad but true...","reviewText":"I was really looking forward to this game. Lament of Innocence was fun, but just, well, lacking in several departments. CoD appeared to have the same graphics engine, but they added back in more of the role playing elements, and it appeared to have more Symphony of the Night type attributes, so I thought it would be a step up (if a small one) from LoI.Alas, I was wrong. I almost bought this game at full price, but decided to rent it instead. I'm very glad I did. This game is, in my opinion, worse than LoI and not fun to play at all. Everything comes off as dull and uninspired. Yeah, you power up with experience, but that alone doesn't make it much more interesting. The Innocent Devils are a novel idea but just don't come off as being that fun (even developing them isn't interesting), and the ability to create your own weapons and armor from items you find, which seemed very cool when I heard about it...just isn't that interesting I'm afraid. Sure, there are a ton of weapons, but most of them are useless, and rarely do you get a weapon that makes you feel like you've really gained an advantage. The stealing ability is just tedious.And the camera...oi, I hate it. It is hard to control and poorly positioned almost always when you let it go on its own. At first I was excited to hear you could control the camera (the static one in LoI got on my nerves) but it actually made it worse. It is very detrimental to combat and gets confused very easily when action really heats up. Plus, you can't look up, only side to side. This really annoyed me as well. If I'm given camera control, I want to be able to look in ALL DIRECTIONS!Overall, I'm sad to say I think this is a VERY poorly designed game, and the worst part of all is the level design. Huge, expansive, flat, and boring as hell. Uninteresting tunnels stretch on and on as you slowly have to run down them and maybe 'yaawn' occasionally battle a few skeletons and 'yaaaaawn' and then you walk through a door to another tunnel exactly 'yaaaaaaawn' like the last. How can they even call this Castlevania!? There is NO platforming (even less than what meager bit there was in LoI), Hector runs infuriatingly slow, monsters are sparse, a pain to battle in most cases, repetitive, and just plain uninteresting, and the environments are just so bland and generic! The environments are even less interesting than LoI. And I don't care what anyone says, the music in this game ISN'T THAT GOOD!I didn't even feel like I was playing a Castlevania game. Indeed, it is Castlevania in name only. Beyond the name, it's just an inferior Devil May Cry clone. As a hardcore Castlevania fan, I hate to bash it this way, but it's sadly true. There are hardly any ties to or trademarks of the series. It was cool seeing Trevor, but that's about it. I have finally given up on this series, unless they release a true 2D Castlevania for a console again (why, oh why can't you just do it!? With modern graphics a 2D Castlevania would be a smash, and I don't understand why they can't see this).Yeah, I know, I'm just wishing on stars.

My computer is not that shabby (P4 3.2MHZ, 2GB RAM, nVidia 7600GT-512MB on ASUS P4P 800) yet, as with STALKER, MoH-AIRBORN stutters and freezes all the time (and I found out that this is true even to people with even much faster PC systems).As with STALKER, when I will have the system to play MoH-AIRBORN to its full potential, the game will be obsolete.All in all, a good game if you have the PC system to handle its true requirements (and the patience to even then endure inconveniencing moments).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2007"}

The new playable character, Rachel, isn't as fun, but her missions are thankfully short and add to the story.Camera: As crappy as ever, but still workableDifficulty: Easy. like I said I ground through the original, in comparison this one I walked through.

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Saints Row + Mass Effect + Prototype = Saints Row IV","reviewText":"THE QUICK REVIEW:It's better than Saints Row the Third, but still has its problems. Superpowers add a whole new element to the game, but everything else could still use some work. It's worth playing, but not worth a full price purchase.THE DETAILED REVIEW:(This is mostly a review for anyone familiar with these types of games or has played Saints Row games in the past.)\"Saints Row the Third\" was a MASSIVE disappointment from its predecessor. While it still had fun gameplay, the rest of the game was limited, downgraded, disappointing, and too stupid and immature with its \"Over The Top\" 3rd grader mentality.\"Saints Row IV\" is fun, with the addition of superpowers inside an alien computer simulation of Steelport, but it still feels just like \"Saints Row 3.5\" instead of a fleshed out sequel.Originally, this was supposed to be a DLC for Saints Row the Third in April 2012 called \"Enter The Dominatrix\". But because of space, they turned much of it into an entire game, which is what Saints Row IV is. The two games are so similar, you can literally use your same character from Saints Row the Third into IV (using the Saints Row Community website). They're that similar of games.However, Saints Row IV stands out from three due to the new missions, objectives, altered activities and return of much beloved past Saints Row characters and features.In all reality, the superpowers and maybe a few missions were probably part of the canceled DLC. And the \"new\" stuff they fleshed out into a separate game would be more of the story, like more missions and returning old favorites.GAMEPLAY:As stated, this game was originally planned to be a very detailed DLC, so it's not surprising that most everything in the game is setup exactly the same as Saints the Third. (Even most of the same glitches are still in, like the 'modding special vehicles in Rim Jobs' glitch.) The gameplay is familiar to Saints Row the Third, only with new powers and agility added in. Shooting is the same, and driving is ALMOST the same. While it seemed like mixing in superpowers with Saints Row gameplay would play oddly, it works well, here. And that's because the superpowers only compliment the shooting gameplay. Your only \"real\" powers will be superhuman speed and superhuman sprinting. The others, like elemental blasts and telekinesis, actually just work more like weapons. In fact, they simply replace grenades. Some people have compared this to \"Crackdown,\" but it's really more like \"Prototype\" with better weapons. And while most of the new alien weapons are pretty dumb and impractical, they can be fun to some people.However, what sucks is, many of the same problems from before persist. Like the lack of a cover system, for example. But at least, they added health recovery items back into the game, at the cost of longer delayed health regeneration, meaning you'll have to rely on killing enemies to heal yourself more than taking cover. Kill an enemy and they'll drop health, unlike in Saints The Third, where you just absorb damage until you can kill everyone, or simply die.A few things are different, like getting rid of notoriety. Since there are no safe houses anymore, you'll now have to get rid of it by chasing down an A.I. bot and smashing it. This can be QUITE annoying and isn't nearly as convenient as simply hiding in your house, like before. Also, the new addition of super-sprinting, as well as the altered car controls (which now make shooting while driving on the 360 extremely difficult, to the point of non-usage) make street vehicles nearly obsolete. Aircraft still has its uses though, as stamina is not infinite (when you first start out), and you'll constantly need to get around Virtual Steelport. But now, summoning vehicles and using them through your phone/HUB works instantly. Call up a vehicle and you'll immediately warp in it, since you're inside a simulation, anyway.The game is setup a lot like \"Mass Effect 2\" in which you first save/recruit your crew, and then, gain their \"loyalty\" and superpowers and upgrades that come with it. You even have a ship, similar to the Normandy and an A.I. who makes bad jokes (Kinzie is Garrus). There are also \"romances\" in the game too, but it's really just another Mass Effect parody/joke for you to easily sleep with your crew. It's nothing, really.The missions themselves are setup even more linear than before, and because Steelport is just a simulation now, you'll feel like you have less of an open world experience. Especially since most superpowers will need to be upgraded in order to fully utilize them. Most of the fun Activities, like Professor Genki's \"Super Ethical Reality Climax\" and \"Trail Blazing\" are gone, and the new ones aren't that great, but some are. \"Blazin\" is a superpowered hybrid of Cyber Blazing and Racing. And many \"Mayhem\" missions return in altered states, like \"Mech Mayhem\" or \"UFO Mayhem.\" \"Fight Club\" from Saints Row 2 returns, only with superpowers. Professor Genki's \"Mind Over Murder\", where you use telekinesis to hurl stuff through targets, is horrible, on top of feeling utterly pointless and is probably one of the worst activities in the game. And the only original Activity to return and also be in every single Saints game is good old fashioned \"Insurance Fraud.\"7.5/10STORY:While not nearly as good as One, or especially Two, at least this time, they attempt to have a decent story in Saints Row IV. It's an alien apocalypse as the Zin Empire, led by articulate and elegant Emperor Zinyak, invades Earth. The Boss (who is now the U.S. President) as well as humanity's best and brightest are abducted and everyone else is left at the mercy of the Zin. Now it's up to the Saints to break free and destroy the Zin empire from within. Old allies and enemies return as most of the game takes place inside virtual reality Steelport.The lack of drama or suspense is noticeable here, though. While I get Saints Row IV is no \"Mass Effect,\" certain things just don't seem right. For example, early on in the game, the Boss sees someone (actually, more than that) killed by the Zin after escaping the simulation for the first time. His/her response is to simply go back in the simulation and get revenge. No shock, no horror, no sorrow. Nothing, really. You'd think having just seen [___] completely killed by Zinyak, there would be more emotion than \"put me back in the simulation so I can get payback on Zinyak.\"If it wasn't for the nostalgic pull and return of so many beloved Stilwater characters from the series, I'd say the story is almost as bad as The Third. Not quite as much though, so this is definitely an improvement, even if it isn't spectacular, which most people won't expect from Volition, anyways. Expect lots of jokes and gag sights instead of compelling drama or storytelling.6/10SOUND/VOICE ACTING:The voice acting is good. While most all of the returning characters don't have the same voice actors, some of your player protagonists, as well as your closest allies, do return and do a good job. Surprisingly, Volition even had them re-record all your Boss' catchphrases and sayings for the new game, instead of just reusing them. They say their usual quips and one-liners, but they're clearly not reused sound clips and are actually re-recorded. Along with all of this though, Keith David is here, as well, playing himself as well as Julius Little (original leader and founder of the Third Street Saints) and him alone is enough to instantly boost any game's dialogue.9/10MUSIC:The music choices are HORRIBLE! Simply put. This is easily the worst soundtrack of all the Saints Row games and the only radio stations you'll likely listen to are \"The Mix\" or \"Klassic\", which also includes Zinyak educating us mindless fools of this generation with some classic Shakespeare. Everything else outside of those two stations have virtually nothing, whatsoever. Either bad songs from no-names, or the very worst possible songs from known artists, like \"Gold\" from Macklemore. KRhyme has one good song by Kendrick Lamar, Gen-X has one good song from Papa Roach, and K12 has two good songs from Gigamesh and Nero. And everything else (outside The Mix and Klassic) is pure unlistenable garbage. Heavy Metal and Reggaeton (Urban Latin) don't even return. I personally don't even listen to either of those, but I know many people are bummed they don't come back. Reggae music returns, but it seems to not fit in with the sci-fi tone of this game. If it wasn't for the radio station \"The Mix\" (which gives us Haddaway's \"What is Love?\", Outkast's \"Bombs Over Baghdad\", and Montel Jordan's \"This is How We Do It\"), this category would score be a Zero. But it is pretty awesome listening to \"What is Love?\" while escaping a Zin Mothership. And also, surprisingly appropriate.Not to mention the game being heavily influenced by Dubstep this time around. So much so, it has its own weapon, appropriately named the Dubstep Gun. It's a music genre you'll either love, barely tolerate (like me), or absolutely loathe, so be aware that most of the game's non-radio soundtrack is the wub wub techno noises known as dubstep. This is another game where you'll likely listen to your own music or nothing at all than the songs on the game.2/10GRAPHICS/VISUAL:It's almost exactly the same as Saints Row the Third. Maybe SLIGHTLY better. However, the permanent night sucks. Steelport was already pretty ugly at night. This game will be even more of an eyesore. Even after turning up the Brightness and Gamma settings to maximum. But, for what it's worth, the digital effects of the \"simulation\" are nice and work well, especially with entering the simulation and it 'loading in' once you come through the gateway. They can sometimes be a bit of a problem, for example, when modding a car and not being able to see cause it's constantly glitching, but these are minor issues. At the very least, they remind you that none of this is real, even inside the game itself. So harming pedestrians will bother your conscience even less now.5/10OTHER:The game freezes and crashes. A LOT. In fact, its very likely you won't be able to play longer than three hours without the HUB screen freezing on you or the game completely crashing and having to restart the console. This is obviously very annoying. The HUB screen loves to not load and freeze on you often. And if that doesn't get you, the game will just hard-crash during gameplay. Very uncool for a sixty dollar game! And sadly, I doubt they will remedy this with future DLC, just like they never added in a 'Mission Replay' feature in Saints Row the Third. This feature also likely won't return.OVERALL:\"Saints Row IV,\" much like The Third, is a lot of hype and it doesn't quite live up to expectations. But don't get me wrong; it can be a fun game, and it definitely is better than Saints the Third, even if it still doesn't quite give us that amazing feeling anyone who loved \"Saints Row 2\" had when playing it for the first time. Most of the game is recycled from The Third, so it'll never really feel like you're playing an actual sequel, but the superpowers does give you a whole new experience and way of playing. Even with the superpowers though, the structure of the game and the way missions are set up make it feel less like an open world game and things feel very structured and limited.Also, I have to mention, the ability to replay missions do NOT return! Just like the prior game. So that's a major disadvantage. Also, the game is really short if you only do the Main Missions and skip side quests and activities. \"Saints Row IV,\" while not quite on the level of the Stilwater games, is still worth playing. I just wouldn't buy it for full price. I'd say it's a $30-$35 game, not a full $60 game. Because of that, it's hard to tell whether to give it 3 Stars or 4 Stars on here. It is fun, but if you've played Saints Row the Third before, the superpowers are the only real draw, here. And if you've played Saints Row 1 and 2 before, it's the superpowers and the nostalgic characters returning.Overall: 7/10(3.5/5 Stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Zalmorion the Fantastic","summary":"INCREDIBLE TURN-BASED PERFECTION","reviewText":"GREAT JOB FIRAXIS AND 2K GAMES!!!!!!  I LOVE THIS GAME.  :)So much fun to be had here.  If you love strategy games and are tired of the frenetic nonsense that real time strategy games force you to handle, XCOM is the way to go.  The computer will only handle the aliens.  With an AI system that makes every engagement unfold differently, every occurrence on the world stage unpredictable, every discovery of alien craft or alien landings or alien abduction attempts novel and fun.You micro-manage all of your soldiers' moves, level them up through a simple yet exciting skill tree, name them if you wish, and customize their armor textures, facial features, and the colors of their uniforms.  When they level up far enough they get nicknames you can customize as well.  Really cool details that make gameplay a lot more personal and fun.  Watching a soldier built to resemble someone in your head, a celebrity, a friend, etc. going up against the aliens is a nerdy treat.You control and coordinate an underfunded, under-skilled, under-equipped human coalition against an overwhelmingly powerful alien enemy whose purposes here are as mysterious as their technology, biology,and psychic powers--all of which you get to study and integrate into humanity's defenses.  If you can capture the alien invaders.  Which is a challenging bit of fun, getting soldiers close enough to snag an alien without getting their faces melted off or chewed off or blown to bits.The various options that you have to manage are interesting, exciting, and always evolving.  Scientific research of captured or killed aliens, alien technologies, etc.  Engineering feats like building new technology and new facilities and (eventually) new fighter craft and robots.  Hiring and training soldiers and checking them for psionic talents (eventually).  Upgrading facilities at the cost of others.  Upgrading equipment types at the cost of others.  Lots of fun, challenging decisions that will impact the other part of the game that is the most fun: TURN-BASED COMBAT MISSIONS!The missions can turn out a dozen different ways, depending on the combination of soldiers you assign to the mission (snipers, assault, support, heavy weapons specialists), the type of mission (kill aliens, capture aliens, capture technology, escort a targeted human, rescue dozens of civilians being terrorized, rescue a high priority target, etc), and the aliens you will face (ethereals, mutons, grays, berzerkers, floaters, sectopods, etc--all human nicknames).  The terrain is always different: forests, city streets, alien spacecraft, swamps, construction sites, office buildings, etc.  The cover options always matter: a car can explode, a barrel will fall apart, a brick wall is pretty great until a high-powered weapon knocks it away, a park bench can only last so long, a tree is great unless someone disintegrates part of it, a mound of earth or a boulder is always good cover, cover on high ground gives you advantages--especially if you are a sniper.  And so on.  You get the idea.  Really well-thought options that change combat dramatically.The combat animations are superb.  It is great fun to shove a shotgun in an alien face and pull that trigger, baby.  Guns blaze and blood splatters and bodies collapse or arch through the air or tumble off of higher ground.The weapon discharges, alien sounds, human squad talk--all sound superb.  The ambient sounds and animations make each board feel like a living area.  The music is often spooky during scouting phases and thrilling during battle.Simply an excellent strategy game.  Clawing your way up from a disadvantaged human defense coalition to a formidable force of humans who use improvised alien technology against the invaders is a thrilling, challenging, journey.You have to experience it to appreciate it.  But you will not be wasting your money buying this game.  The game developers made a true gem that will be enjoyed for many years to come.  The replay possibilities are absolutely endless.I cannot express how happy I am that they made this game.  I almost did not buy it too.  With all the hype being given to other games coming out!Take a chance on XCOM, if you love strategy and action.Now, Firaxis and 2K, how about some DLC and expansions?  :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Critics too harsh on this one","reviewText":"It is simply sad how some folks have given this game one star simply because they either don't like Capcom or other personal reasons. I personally despise Capcom for the cheap tactics they have used in the past. Therefore, I bought this game only after it got a bit cheaper. Now that I have played it, I have to say it is nowhere near as bad as people describe. On the contrary, it is a great game.**********************To start with pros.**********************-Decent Graphics and Great Character Design (for most part): Not much to say here. You must have seen trailers etc., as far as I can say the game looks great and most character other than Ada are very nicely design.-Four Different Campaigns and Seven Different Characters: To me this was pretty impressive. There are 3 different campaigns that you play with a pair of characters (Leon and Halena; Chris and Piers; Jake and Sherry) and Ada gets her own campaign. In each campaign, both characters have different personalities and moves. Their weapons are also slightly different and at times they travel using different paths. I personally loved this. This adds so much replayability to the game.-Very Personal Stories: There are 4 different stories of 4 campaigns that intersect at many points. Stories in each campaign are very personal to characters of those campaigns and honestly made me sad for those characters especially for Chris. Finishing the 4 campaigns will give basic idea, but if you want to learn about the events in more details you can collect the blue medallions to unlock files that have detailed description of events.-Believable Voice Acting: I like the voice acting in this game. Definitely makes the story more dramatic and personal.-Great Variety in Campaigns: In this game there will be parts where bullets will be scarce and you will be surviving hordes of Zombie attacks and other parts where you will have plenty of explosives and you will be fighting hoards of zombies, huge monster and/or bosses.  In addition, you also have some vehicle gameplay in some levels which for most part is very entertaining.-Awesome Melee Combos and Quick Shots: I strongly suggest that player learn this early in the game as the game does not necessarily teaches you. This are fun to you and will make your experience much more enjoyable.-Nicely Designed Bosses: This is a must for me, especially in Resident Evil games. I loved the creation of main bosses in this game. Each campaign has multiple bosses, but the final bosses for each campaigns are the best. Personally loved the main boss for Leon/Halena . Very creative design.-Fun Online Modes: OK online gameplay is no Halo or COD, but still is quite fun. Like RE5, you can play story mode with a friend or do the same with Mercenary mode (You and a friend surviving hoards). Agent Hunk mode is interesting as you can invade other player's game (with their consent) as a creature.-Great Length and Replayability: I like to explore each level rather than just run through the story so it took me well >25 hrs to finish the game. At least on the normal mode, you can't rush through the campaign. Enemies and Quicktime events will punish you if you do so. And as I describe above due to number and variability of characters, this game has great replayability. Also campaign is interesting enough to make you play again.RPG element: Not necessary but is good to have. If you shoot enough enemies and search enough you acquire skill point with which you can get different perks making game easier and fun as you play along.Cut Scene Gallery: If you don't want to play the whole game again and just want to watch cutscenes. You have that option. LOVE IT and I hope more games have such cutscene replay options.**********************Now the Cons.**********************Too Dark at Points: I get it that this game is supposed to be creepy/scary but it is just way too dark at few points (especially Leon's campaign). At least after the enemy surprises me I should be able to see it. I tried adjusting brightness et., but no use.Too many Quicktime Events: I loved the quick time events in Resident Evil 4, but think this game has way too many of them. And some quick time events are punishment to your hands and controller. They should ease up on these in future games. Seriously. Fortunately, there are a few ways to turn some off them off (Amateur level and a skill I believe).Ada Wong: I have liked Ada in previous RE games and movies, but they have COMPLETELY MESSED UP her character design in this game. The voice acting and dialogues are also very poor. Her campaign is short which is fine as it is supposed to be complementary anyways, but her final boss and endings are very disappointing.**********************Conclusion**********************Contrary to the cons I described, this is a great game overall and is an experience you probably don't want to miss. Now that it is cheaper than before, I would definitely buy it and give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

Cutting out all the games that require a great amount of luck without any real strategy, you only have about 5 decent games.The only point of single player mode is to get prizes, which obviously don't exist except in the game. So your only choice is to play games based mostly on luck about 50 times until you get lucky and get the prize. The prize which you can look at, but serves even less purpose than Microsoft Xbox's gamer points. (At least those other people can see too)In multiplayer, you can pick a minigame, which are very roughly characterized in an overdone menu selection screen that depicts signs and pictures that, if anything, take away from the overall game quality. Or, you can randomly pick 5 games, and whoever gets the most points from all 5 is the winner. However, since half the games involve mostly luck, you will find many of the games show one person getting 1, and everyone else getting 0. Furthermore, very few games let you play at the same time, which draws out the length of the game (especially with 4 people playing) You have to watch each person do there turn in between each of yours, which makes the very simple tasks this game involves even more tedious. It also pretty much takes away the multiplayer function of the game, and makes it feel not so much multi player anymore.Many of the games are glitchy too. I have seen about three games where accidentally doing something causes the game to jam and makes it impossible to win or even play. And mind you, I have only picked up the game a few times, it's not like a play it alot.If the game really wanted to be good, a real multiplayer, better unlockables(as opposed to one super game unlockable from each area, have more, and perhaps have the games have different properties) The menu screen would have to be redone, and the characters should integrate miis. If they wanted to have there own characters you design, they should have a least made some of the designs not butt ugly. (Or at least have on of the unlockable items be a bag to put over their head)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004SWM0","description":"Though it lacks the dramatic intensity of theFinal  Fantasyseries--the crown prince of console role-playing  games--SquareSoft'sLegend of Manastill satisfies with its beautiful  hand-drawn sets and its innovative nonlinear gameplay.Billed as the sequel to the Super Nintendo'sSecrets of Mana,Legend of Mana's story contains more than 60 self-contained  miniquests, but generally the goal is to restore the world's Mana, or  life energy. Gamers won't need to be obsessive about winning all the  quests, but there are some challenges that must be completed if you  wish to reach the final showdown. The game begins as players choose  either a male or female lead character while a map displays the new  lands within the world of Fa'Diel. In each of these lands, players will  find items and clues they can use in other lands. The fragmented nature  of the game can be disorienting for gamers looking for quick  gratification. A diary can be used to keep track of current miniquests,  while an encyclopedia neatly organizes the vast amount of story players  uncover. Due to the vast nature of this game's plot, you'll likely need  these features to stay focused on your quests.Animefans will be wowed by the character design and beautifully  illustrated storybook backgrounds.

Hooker \"bulmabriefs144\"","summary":"Hate nonlinear plots... hate em hate em hate em (unless they're done right)","reviewText":"Despite all that, there is a right way to do them, as well as the wrong way, which they just did.  If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.  OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink, but she has a change of heart and drug it instead.  You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator, but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war.  OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying, the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town, and put an end to it, and he has proof. So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.This is nonlinear plotline, the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game, even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero.  Assume the hero died in the thief story, the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl, and her adventures.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2005"}

This one is better than the Wii game (Super Paper Mario).The fighting in this game is what is better. Each battle occurs on a stage and you get 1 side kick to help you. There are some real time events during the fighting where you can press certain buttons to add more damage or attack an audience member that is about to throw a hammer at you. You get regular attack moves and special moves. The fighting is what really sets this game apart. In the Wii game, fighting is all real time so they did away with the stage.The story is the typical princess kidnapped and you have to save her but it was not by Bowser. You actually get to play as Bowser and Peach during the story mode. There are lots of areas to explore and lots of side quests you can do. The game is quite long but it doesn't get repetitive. There is even an area where you can battle through all the enemies in the game, including the bosses. Luigi is in the game but he just tells long and boring stories and I didn't bother sticking around to read them.You progress through the game by gaining new paper abilities, such as turning into an airplane, or folding up to roll along. you also get an ability that lets you turn sideways to squeeze through cracks or fall through sewer covers. Some of my favorite areas were the moon, the battle arena, and the island.Graphics: Very good. Typical Mario fashion but very well done for an open world game.Sound: Again, typical Mario fashion.Controls: Easy to execute, no problems at all.Conclusion: If you haven't played this game, it is worth picking up even if you only have a Wii. It will still play on the Wii but you will need a GameCube controller to play it. This game was ranked #16 of the top 25 GameCube games by IGN. It is truly a great game and one that will stay in my collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Team up against a new kind of horror","reviewText":"You know, after awhile it does seem to sink in: I just don't get fan expectations. They'll argue over anything and everything, no matter how tiny (the \"Superman Returns\" apparently got negative feedback because his cape was the wrong shade of red...ugh) or quite simply what was accepted once is renounced now. With Resident Evil 4, the series changed the trademark static camera angles and offered fully 3D environments and not only improved the series in every conceivable way, it was a kickass title to boot. So the disappointment fans and even reviewers feel about the latest entry is kind of baffling but then again the Remake was seen as an excellent addition to the franchise whereas the similar Resident Evil Zero, which also had an additional partner, was seen as stale. So after 4 years and endless amount of hype, does 5 prove to be the best Evil of them all?Story: With Umbrella completely finished (seen in the Umbrella Chronicles Wii game), the biochemical terrorist attacks have surfaced still so the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, or BSAA, is formed with 2 immediate recruits: Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, both survivors of Umbrella-related incidents. But when Jill is presumed dead after a mission yet no body is found, Chris heads to Africa to hunt for Irving who's started another terrorist action. Along with African BSAA agent Sheva Alomar, Chris will have to travel deep into the African countryside to get to the bottom of everything.Graphics: I'll say it right up front: Resident Evil 5 is probably the most graphically stunning game available right now. Whereas Gears of War 2 is no slouch, everything you can think of and this game seems to have excelled: lighting, character animation and textures, special effects, the in-game cinematics and on and on. The amount of detail in each character can be seen in unlockable figurines which really hits its stride showcasing some of the boss fight creatures and seeing detail up close. I noticed a bit of screen tearing but honestly, I noticed it maybe once every couple of hours so hardly worth any concern.Sound/Music: Ask anyone who's been playing Resident Evil games for years will know one thing: the voice acting has frequently been laughable. Even the remake had a couple of lines that were iffy. 5 improves on it and there's barely any lines or characters that make me go \"ugh, back to normal\"...well that is except for Irving, who is just bad. The music is also quite moody and really kicks into overdrive and makes bigger encounters like boss fights all the more epic. Essentially, this is a more cinematic Resident Evil. My one slight complaint? Not as awesome save room music.Gameplay: We all know the complaints so might as well say them: tank controls, lack of strafe, no jump back and inability to move to different sides of cover...well okay that's a new feature but honestly it does get old which is a plus and an annoyance. At times it would've been great to roll backwards and shoot instead of quickturn, run, quickturn, shoot by which time, enemies probably are within 5-8 feet of you anyway. While Capcom says it adds to the tension, control-wise this is either one of those \"well what'd you expect from an RE game?\" things or \"wish they'd finally change it\". Honestly I'm so used to the controls thanks to RE4 that I never cursed the game for not allowing me the ability to do something but that being said, would've been nice to add at least some features.The big addition to 5 is co-op where you're rarely separated from your partner and even in the same room, they're always somewhere nearby. This needs a fantastic AI however Sheva is adequate though not entirely flawless. She'll frequently shoot you in the back instead of relocating to the side, she'll stand in front unlike Ashley who ducked or ran behind you and she has a habit of reloading at awful times (like right in front of a chainsaw-wielding dude), you can't plant her somewhere to provide cover fire and giving her a handgun is just bullet-wasting. However healing you tends to take top priority and she's a remarkably excellent shot with a rifle. Most will use her as a 2nd inventory trunk but in combat she works but then she frustrates.This is where co-op mode comes in. With split-screen, system link and online, a buddy can play as Sheva which makes for a more tactical approach to fighting such as cover fire, distraction and the like. You can locate any chapter you want, specify the difficulty and even select the right country for a more quicker connection. Only problem is that it's not like Gears of War 2 where you can select where in the level you want to start. Keep in mind, chapter completion achievements only popped up for me when I either single-play or co-op an entire level start to finish so you can't get halfway, hit save point before difficult part, and switch to co-op. So it would've been nice to say \"find all chapter start\" players instead of just being dropped randomly.One thing that Resident Evil games frequently had was replay value which usually involved speed runs. Well while one exists, RE5 expands on this considerably, especially if you want to 1000/1000 this sucker. Basically there's figurines which you can access via chapter completion, BSAA medallions hidden in the game (similar to getting the Punisher handgun in RE4) or upgrading a weapon fully. Then there's unlockable costumes, infinite ammo, and the ever-popular Mercenaries mode. Let's just say for completionist people, RE5 will keep you very busy. Hopefully with DLC, they can add more character or stages to Mercenaries and make it even fatter but there's still plenty of stuff to do to keep you interested.BTW, for the collector's edition: you get a BSAA patch for a jacket, a totally non-Chris Redfield look-alike figurine, a making-of disc and a Tricell messenger bag as well as a Africa-shaped pendant. For those who love to buy Collector/Limited editions just to have the biggest edition this isn't really an absolute must-have but it's sure cool to have all these goodies.Resident Evil 5 for me so far represents the last game for awhile that I'd consider a day one purchase as others are simply \"I'll check it out down the line\" types. It's Game of the Year contender for me though so early in the year and with so many complainers, might not win but after the great Street Fighter IV, Capcom seem to be on a roll.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}

I really wish Capcom would come up with a new story instead of recycling the same story in different settings.Graphics 10/10The graphics are outstanding!  Hordes of zombies charge at you through the dusty roads of a shanty town.  Dynamic explosions and blur effects fill the screen!  The characters look great!  The camera work in the cutscenes is top notch.  The visual effects highlight the action!  Graphics can't get much better than this!Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is the same as Resident Evil 4, but some finesse has been added.  You aim and shoot at hordes of zombies, while trying to conserve ammo.  You can also try and make the most of your environment by using hazards and obstacles to your advantage.  Because the new additions to the series focus on Cooperative Gameplay, you can combo attacks with your partner.  If they shoot a zombie, the zombie performs its hit animation and that allows you to attack it with a devastating punch or kick.  Two Players can work together to take out a group of zombies and conserve a lot of ammo if they coordinate their attacks well.  This level of precision gameplay really encourages Players to work as a well-oiled machine.Levels 10/10The Levels in Resident Evil 5 are outstanding!  They're varied, they're beautiful, and they're designed to prevent you from getting lost.  From shanty towns, to ancient ruins, to scientific laboratories, the level progression makes you feel like you're progressing through an exciting story.  There are vehicle chase sequences, fun puzzles, frantic battles, and epic boss fights. Strategically placed landmarks and objective markers always point you in the right direction, so you never feel lost or frustrated.You are graded on your performance in the levels, based on deaths, accuracy, kills, and time.  You can replay levels to stockpile items, cash, or to improve your grade.  At the end of each level or after a continue, you can manage your inventory by buying new items, upgrading weapons, or storing items in a virtual locker.AI 8/10Sheva is great most of the time.  She saves your life quite a bit, but she also uses healing objects a little too fast.  She can hold her own in a fight and you can give her commands like COVER (conservative mode) or ATTACK (use more ammo).  She's really great at gathering items while you're fighting or exploring.  At any time, you can ask her to give you one of her items or give her some of yours, too.  There are a few parts of the game where Sheva can get insta-killed (especially in the beginning), causing you to start the level over, but it's not her fault.  It's more of a gameplay issue rather than an AI issue.The enemy AI is good, not great.  The enemies are pretty convincing as enraged zombies, but there are times when they get hung up on corners or walk in circles.  If your glass is half-full, you can imagine that they're just acting more zombie-like.Sound  9/10The voice acting, SFX, and Music are all very good.  If you want to get the most out of this game, playing it in surround sound will put you in the center of the action!Interface 8/10Both Chris and Sheva have 3x3 Square inventories and you can hotkey the 2,4,6,8 positions by pressing up, left, right, and down on the D-pad.  Everything takes up 1 space, whether it's a weapon, ammo, or a healing item.  The inventory management works well almost all of the time.  The downside is when you and Sheva only have 1 space each and you find a Red Herb and a Green Herb.  You literally have to do this in real time:Pick up Red Herb (if you pick up Green first Sheva may use it), Call Sheva, Give her the Red Herb, Pick Up the Green Herb, Exchange an item with Sheva to get the Red Herb, Highlight the Red Herb, Combine it with the Green Herb.  Doing this while you're being attacked can get annoying.  The other reason why this is annoying is that Red Herbs can only be combined with Green Herbs... so why isn't it automated?!  Does the game really need me to play inventory micromanager for 30 seconds to make a healing item?!  How does this enrich my gameplay experience?!Areas Needing Improvement (aside from the Inventory)If you hold the Left Trigger to aim your weapon, you can't move... not even a little bit and this gets really annoying.  You have to turn around, run 2 steps, then turn around again, if you want to step back and fire.  This and the Inventory Issues feel restricting for the sake of being restricting.Also, to slash with the Knife, you have to hold LB, and then press RT to slash the knife.  You can only do 1 thing with the Knife, so why can't I just press LB?!Overall Resident Evil 5 is a great single player or cooperative action game.  It deserves to be in your Xbox 360 collection.  But horror fans should understand that this is not a suspenseful horror game.  It's an exciting action game with big explosions, a hail of gunfire, and witty banter.  Even the soundtrack is more befitting of an action game than a horror game.The game is rated M for Violence, Gore, and Language.Buy it if you loved Resident Evil 4, you want a Great 2-Player Game, you can appreciate a great graphics, or you're a fan of action-packed-actiony-action and you need to kill Wesker just one more time.If you're looking for a horror game, Silent Hill:  Homecoming, Dead Space, and even Gears of War 2 are scarier.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2009"}

I got the game on Friday night after work and finished the campaign on Sunday afternoon.

What I mean by that is I am lousy at it.  It's fun and I understand that it is awesome, but I absolutely stink out loud at it.  I'm pretty good at Halo MP, but that is because Halo is more of a keep moving and when your crosshairs turn red pull the trigger (run 'n' gun) whereas MW2 is more a stay out of sight and take out any enemies that come around and hope they don't see you first.

In this version, there are no more plot twists that mesh the other games directly into this one, instead giving us a moment of clarity that is interesting in some ways and claustrophobically strange in others. Now, we are given a clean slate by the producers, transporting us back to the day before everything transpired.Included in this setup is something new, a feature that allows \"partner zapping,\" letting you switch back and forth between two playable characters in real time. According to the producers, you end up controlling both characters approximately 70 to 80% of the time, allowing you to bring them both together or play them separately. This allows for some complexities to be introduced in the way of puzzles, plus provide obstacles that have been previously unheard of.

The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action.

Manage Alicia&apos;s health &amp; magic meters to avoid running out of ammo or power -- be strategic &amp; play it safe, or the world dies with her.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Avoid this witch's lame spell","reviewText":"Bullet Witch is bad. Atari and Cavia's third-person action game is so bad, in fact, that I don't even feel like it deserves a flowery introduction. Toss in a terrible game engine, embarrassing graphics, and don't forget to leave out all of the A.I. You're bubbling up a stew of Bullet Witch, kiddies!Protagonist Alicia is busy running around killing demons after years of horrible events wipe out the vast majority of humankind. She's quiet but she's got a sharp attitude and a hot trigger finger. This is the premise of Bullet Witch, and very little else is explained as the game progresses. Alicia doesn't like demons. She wants to kill them. It's that simple.Unfortunately, it actually isn't that simple. Alicia, despite being an attractive heroine, controls like a grumpy old man with a crooked walker. She's got some nimble dodge moves mapped to the Xbox 360's L trigger, and these moves let her avoid everything short of exploding cars, falling objects, and snipers that are evidently so sharp that they can nail her mid-jump. In other words, you won't be avoiding much as you hop around wildly and steer your cow-like character around the levels.You also won't be shooting much; the game's collision detection seems random at best. I would often stand a few paces from an enemy, unloading a machine gun's entire magazine only to watch the enemy mow down Alicia using his machine gun. Lame. The collision detection rears its ugly face anytime the game's \"Walnut Head\" enemies come around. Walnut Heads are floating bodies with huge, pulsating brains-they control magical barriers that Alicia has to break down to continue through the levels, meaning that fighting Walnut Heads is mandatory. Walnut Heads have the power of telekinesis and telepathically throw cars and other huge objects at Alicia, commonly killing her before she's even spotted them.Alicia can use her broom-like gun (imagine that) to kill enemies, and the player can even change the gun into different forms. By finishing levels, you earn skill points and can upgrade the machine gun into a shotgun, sniper rifle, or gatling gun. Unfortunately, none of the unlockable forms are as efficient as the machine gun. Since there is unlimited ammo, and Alicia doesn't seem to die quickly, there isn't much need to think while shooting. Alicia's spellcasting powers are terribly done; using the bumpers you'll scroll through different types of magic. Some magic, like the \"Ancient Wall\" ability, is completely useless. Ancient Walls completely obstruct your view and break down quickly. Natural set pieces like blown-up cars and corners provide much better cover. Offensive spells like meteor storms and lightning bolts are powerful but use most of your magic points and therefore can't be utilized often enough to be considered helpful. Annoyingly, animations are loaded up as Alicia conjures up her destructive powers that prevent her from avoiding any attacks whatsoever and even freeze her in place for seconds after casting. Even worse, you can't hotkey any of the magic spells to the otherwise unused directional pad-what's the deal with that?Artificial intelligence is completely missing from this product. In the second level you encounter a few building-sized buffoons with huge machine guns; they're designed to look absolutely monumental and terrifying but are actually gentile giants. Each of them that I encountered in that level actually stopped walking toward me, stopped shooting, and calmly allowed me to shoot their pulsating hearts until they exploded and fell to the ground. I thought the first giant might be a fluke, but indeed the next ones just stopped their terror-inducing rage when they laid eyes on Alicia. The basic grunts are so incredibly stupid that they'll actually walk away from you and into walls after being shot. Still, they've got heart-they're so hell-bent on killing innocent humans that they'll ignore Alicia filling their backside with lead and lightning bolts. I've seen daddy long-legs missing all eight long legs put up more of a struggle than these brainless dolts.Bullet Witch is among the ugliest of the Xbox 360's library. As I ran through the post-apocalyptic settings I couldn't help but think of Majesco's Xbox sleeper Phantom Dust-but even that bargain Xbox title looked better and ran better than this Xbox 360 one. There are blurry and undetailed textures everywhere, little to no particle effects as a result of shooting the ground, walls, or glass-hell, the only visually-pleasant sights are the game's menus and the trails of smoke that accompany smoldering, exploded and destroyed cars on their trip back to the ground. Remember those giants I was just going on about? After completing that level, you see a newspaper clipping with a sub-headline that reads, \"Who's going to remove these giant corpses from the streets?\" No one, silly! The bodies disappear when you move away from them! Other objects do the opposite, appearing as Alicia approaches their vicinity. Clipping must be one of Alicia's witchcraft powers, because she can walk through what appear to be solid chairs, tables, fire hydrants, crates-the list goes on.All of the above problems are silhouetted by the fact that Bullet Witch is about six hours long. There are six levels, each takes about an hour to complete. Doing so earns you some Xbox 360 Achievements, but there is no way that even the most addicted Achievement freak should spend $60 on a video game that offers six levels. There are currently plans to release more content via Xbox Live, but this is a $20 product trespassing in a $60 box.If Bullet Witch had a consistent physics engine, artificial intelligence of any kind, and even a trace of collision detection it might be an average shooter. As it is...well, in the first sentence of this review I said, \"Bullet Witch is bad.\" I just repeated it, and it doesn't need to be said again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2007"}

How cool was it that within 5 minutes you already had a rythm going, you probably missed a few hits, but still, all you had to do was get into the rythm of the song and your fingers would just move along. Well, your fingers will try to do the same thing on DJ Hero, you'll just miss a lot more hits if they do!At first glance, without knowing much about this game, other than being a rythm game, I thought it would be a walk in the park compared to other rythm games, I mean it only has three colored buttons on screen as oppossed to five. Well, now add the crossfader and the scratching features and you have a totally different game! There's definitely a steep learning curve in this game, don't think that just because you rocked at World Tour, you'll be coming in here owning the place, you'll get there eventually, but it won't be as easy as you think.One of the things that I noticed was that I was so used to playing Guitar games and pressing the tabs with my left hand fingers, that when I had to use the right on the turntable, it kinda felt akward at first, it's no big deal but I'm sure you'll notice it too.In my own opinion, this doesn't feel like it's following a beat as much as all the other rythm games, I often found myself trying to press buttons to the rythm of the music but what was shown on screen was one button hit here and there and lots of crossfade action which seems to me, was added just to keep the DJ theme. All other Hero games focus on one instrument per player, which makes it easy to just focus on the drums, bass or guitar and just follow it till the end of the song, this is probably what messed me up a few times, I was trying to find some instrument to follow till I realised \"man, I'm playing all instruments at once!\"Don't get me wrong, it's a very satisfying experience once you get a feel for this game, if you were looking for a challenge, this is definitely the game for you.

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

Why you ask? GAMEPLAY! The touch screen is used so well in this game that it makes you feel like you are really part of the action. Getting emails, hot wiring cars, making molotov cocktails! Its all great! There is so much to do, taxi, vigilante, ambulance, fire truck missions are all here. This is not a watered down GTA game, it actually has more to do than other GTA games. The drug dealing side \"mini game\" is actually very addictive and fun. Traveling the city making the big $$$ while always on alert that the cops could bust you for selling or buying drugs with the many dealers around the city. One great thing they added was being able to fight back the cops while driving. If your being chased you can disable the cop cars by making them crash and it makes your wanted level get lowered! It really gives you a reason to run from the cops and try to take them out, which is a lot more fun and challenging than just hiding and waiting for your stars to go away. This is the real deal here, and the graphics are amazing to me, great cel shaded graphics that give the game a comic book feel while still running smoothly. Don't hesitate to pick up this work of art... it is more fun on the DS than the PSP because of the touch screen! Great for portable gamers all around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2010"}

Such is the case with Radiant Historia.Radiant Historia is a single player turn-based RPG that tells the story of Stocke. Stocke is an agent in the Special Intelligence division in the kingdom of Alistel. Stocke is entrusted with the White Chronicle. This book allows Stocke to see beyond the present into other times. With the help of two allies, the White Chronicle eventually allows Stocke to travel through time to change things that should never have been and make things the way they ought to be.What makes Radiant Historia so unique and innovative is players can manipulate individual enemy positions during battle so that multiple enemies occupy the same space and can thus be attacked at the same time by party members. Not only that but objectives that can not be achieved through battle may be available through the game's time travel. The choices you make matters in this game moreso than they do in other RPGs of this type.I can't recommend Radiant Historia enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004CVWETI","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"I expected more than what I got.","reviewText":"That's not to say the game is horrible.  Rather, I expected more \"game\" than I actually received.  I was skeptical about just how fun such a game could possibly be, so I wasn't expecting a shockingly amazing experience or anything...but to put it in a sentence, Radiant Historia is a game without direction.You start the game as a man called Stocke, an employee of the Specint (short for \"Special Intelligence\", if you didn't pick that up) group.  In a nutshell, you are assigned special missions, ranging from minor creature attacks to escorting people from place to place.  Your employer, Heiss, calls you into the office for a new assignment.  As part of this, he hands you a White Chronicle, a key item in the game's progression (though you are unaware of this at the time), and asks you to discover its secrets.Radiant is very long in the tooth when it comes to true gameplay.  Where it shines, or at least tries to, is the telling of its story.  Ironically enough, the story is actually quite good.  Without spoiling anything, you are one of two Chronicle holders, and the Chronicle gives you the power to go back to key events along one of two timelines, altering the path of the other as you go.  It's an intriguing concept and one that is also difficult to do in video games and movies, especially since nobody really has a true grasp of the inner workings of \"time travel\".  Fortunately, in Radiant, you're not actually traveling through just time.  Actually, you're traveling through what some think to be the 4th dimension - where you are not reliving points of your own history and seeing yourself as you were, but rather that you're folding time in such a way that you are moving back and forth along a linear timeline.  The reason this makes sense is that you don't lose any of your experiences or memories when you do these leaps.  In fact, your memories are key to the reason you're doing the move, and there are times you'll be called upon to fight more dangerous creatures during a leap to the past that you know weren't there before.  But again, another Chronicle holder is dancing around time causing issues.The best analogy I can think of: anyone who's watched Quantum Leap and remembers the Evil Leaper dual-part episode, that's basically what's going on here.I mentioned that Radiant was at least making a solid attempt to tell a good story.  I say \"attempt\", because though the story is actually a solid one, it's not told well at all.  Part of this is not the storyteller's fault; as I mentioned, it's VERY difficult to tell a story about time travel and do it in such a way that it not only makes sense, but is perfectly logical and sensible given all that we know.  Since this is a game and not real life, some can be forgiven, but others are just blatant oversights that make you scratch your head in utter confusion.  As I mentioned, you'll start out under Heiss' command, and then reach your first key decision which creates your two timelines.  It doesn't really matter which you choose first, because no matter what you do you'll have no choice but to jump to the other timeline.  In other words, there is no \"perfect scenario\" where time leaping isn't required.  This seems funny and almost wrong; it's like you're compelled to change history to benefit you, and you can't help but feel as though the game is made artificially long with this requirement.  It's not a bad thing, but it just doesn't feel comfortable for some reason.You'll interact with the same characters in either timeline, but differently.  You also will go to the same places, but at different times in each timeline.  Where this seems to go wrong is when you want to try and complete the storyline.  The game tracks your progress in a timeline map that you can access in-game, and there are side quests where you will be asked to do various things to help complete the story.  A lot of these are simple - deliver a letter, find an item, etc.  A lot are not.  The bulk require you to go back in time and either change something that went wrong, save someone from dying, or find someone that someone else is looking for.  In of itself this would not be a problem, but because of the way that timeline map is shown, later in the game it gets extremely difficult to track progress.  It seemed to me at times that it would have been more useful to have, instead of a left-right map, just a simple listing of events in a hierarchy with completed tasks starred or grayed out, so I could focus on what was not done without too much scrolling.  It's hard to describe without seeing it, but know that by around the middle of the game, I was frustrated trying to figure out what I needed to do next.Also, with trying to do the side events, it's extremely tasking to know exactly where to leap back in time.  Sometimes it's obvious, like when a person is at a certain point and you can jump right to that point.  Sometimes it isn't, like when someone dies in a cave and you need to figure out how they got there and how they died in order to save them.  Many times I ended up clearing side quests without ever really knowing how I did it, and some side quests I never did complete because it was never clear how to get to the point I needed to be in.  Because there's no free travel in the game, even if you know that a certain task is in a certain city, you can't just warp to that city.  From 90% of the key points you can't even walk to the city freely.  The linearity in the game hinders your ability to truly explore all there is and there is only one way to get to everything, which I found a little unsettling.  For example, there is one sidequest where you must retrieve a sword from a person who is in a specific town.  It doesn't tell you when.  It only tells you they are in a town that you only happen to be in from one specific key event.  You will then be told that the person \"just left\" the inn, but there are no additional clues as to where they went, and you might assume you need to leap before they got to the inn, but there aren't any such key events.I was not happy to see that the battle engine was even less redeeming.  Similar to such games asEnchanted Arms, your enemy is on a 9-space grid, with some enemies occupying more than space.  Your characters are in a normal turn-based line, and you have a turn tracker such as that found in some other turn-based games.  Depending on the speed of your characters, you might even get double or even triple turns before your enemy gets a chance to take a turn.  All of the usual RPG goodness is here, replete with regular spells, attacks, and special attacks that you learn from scrolls and books.  Where this breaks down is in the general strategy.  For the most part, I was able to poison every single walking enemy except some shadow enemies near the end of the game.  Fire seemed to work even on enemies where they appeared to specialize in the element, and with the exception of the very last boss, I never once felt as though I was at risk of dying.  Battles that were a little challenging were only so due to who I was forced to use.  Marco, in particular, is good for buffing effects but a horrible fighter, whereas Aht seems to be the most well-rounded of the group, being fully equipped with attack skills, magic, healing, and the fastest on the squad to boot.I have noticed a scary trend in average games having excellent music and this one is no different.  Certain town themes like Alistel and others stand out as having amazing musical compositions and it's clear that a lot of work went into these pieces.  Graphically the game is not horrible, probably in the mid-range of regular DS games, but it's probably not going to win any artful awards.  The box cover art makes you instantly thinkMagna Carta 2, but the game itself is definitely anything but.  Sprites abound, it's also not going to win any awards in the graphics category, though I imagine this should not be a dealbreaker for anyone.One thing to watch out for - the constant traveling through time may cause you to neglect your saving duties.  There are times when, in order to complete the timeline, you must actually \"fail\" and choose the wrong decision.  This then updates the timeline and sets you back to before you made the decision.  Mentally, you'll be tempted to skip saving as you'll feel as though you're effectively immortal, but you want to make sure you remember to save every now and then.  If you get killed, that doesn't actually count in the timeline (for some reason).So...do I recommend it?  I do recommend trying it, especially if you were a fan of Enchanted Arms, or you like turn-based games in general.  I wouldn't call it a legend or a fantastic game, but it has its moments and is worth a shot.  It's got flaws though, so don't go in expecting to be 100% amazed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

While Resident Evil and Silent Hill became more successful Silent Hill still remains the most frightening survival horror series ever made. Homecoming is no exception with lots of fog and lighting effects, unbelievably freaky creatures, a great story with lots of plot twists, and a new and improved combat system. I have to first mention that there is so many little things in this game for hardcore SH fans such as homages to the movie (which most of this game is based on) such as the \"Otherworld peeling\" effect, barbed wire in the church, ash/snow, the Grand Hotel and the nurses. There are references everywhere that mention famous horror authors, horror movies etc. Most people may never find these but they are there such as the streets being last names of famous horror authors.This is really great and thankfully Konami kept all of this in mind for fans, but what if you've never played an SH game before? Well then you came in at a great time. Most people's concern is if the game has the same creepy atmosphere and it does. There are less \"out of the closet\" scares however because the game concentrates more on sheer atmosphere. Everything is dark and creepy, and we have the same spooky unnerving sounds effects and music that we've grown to love. The combat system is what I was mainly concerned about. Gone are the fixed camera angles and tank controls. The game controls very well in a third person style action game. You lock on to enemies and use light and heavy attack combos to kill them. This may be very repetitive and simple, but it's better than being broken. Shooting is easier as well because you know control the gun in a Resident Evil 4 way.Also introduced are button pressing sequences and this helps to the intensity because if you don't do this properly you could die and the game is totally up to you. Also new is a way to control your outcome of the story. Certain moments in the game have you make a choice and this will decide your ending (there are 5 all together). There are a good amount of weapons to pick up such as knives, pipes, axes, shotguns, pistols, rifles etc. Nothing we haven't seen in an SH game before, but you have to decide which weapon is best for which enemy.If you want to go story side it's good and its here. You are a man named Alex Shepard who comes home from being in a war and everyone in Sheperd's Glen is missing (just outside Silent Hill) and his brother Josh is missing. You must find the deep secrets of Silent Hill and why your brother went missing. There are tons of plot twists and it's probably one of the better less confusing stories. The puzzles in Silent Hill are still weird and confusing as ever. I had to get a FAQ for almost every single one because they require you to right down stuff and rattle off riddles in your head and...well...they're still confusing. The game is a bit short, however, and you can beat the game in about 8-10 hours depending on how you play.There is plenty of replay value thanks to the multiple endings, different costumes, and new weapons you can find after you beat the game. There are also collectibles to find such as drawings, photos, and serums to unlock achievements. The game is just very well put together, but you can tell the developers didn't do anything risky with the formula. It's pretty safe and basic, but you'll want to visit Silent Hill again thanks to the excellent story, voice acting, graphics, atmosphere, new enemies, and the button pressing sequences and not to mention the humongous disgusting boss fights! If you love survival horror this is probably the best one of the year so far (Alone in the Dark was almost a disaster).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Not a TD, but Madden 06 360 still scores","reviewText":"With this year's additions to the gameplay, EA Sports had a solid football game in Madden NFL 06. The QB Vision, Truck Stick, Precision Passing, and other systems worked out very well and made an offensively and defensively exciting matchup. They tried very hard to bring this success to the Xbox 360 version, and for the most part, they've done a great job on the gameplay. It's just too bad that there isn't as much to do on this version of the game.While the QB Vision and other features have made it around again, a lot of the other features were hit in the backfield. Say goodbye to Mini Camp and Superstar mode, and say hello once again to the generic Franchise mode, circa 1999. Despite the disappointing lack of modes, playing the game is an entirely different experience. The playcalling menu has been completely changed and now you're given more options and more assistance for a good play. Pre-snap, everything is different. The audibles are still set to the X button, but Hot Routes require the player to manually switch to a reciever or running back, hit the hot route button (Y), and then the button for the route that should be run. After a bit of practice, this system is easy, but it's not as deceptive, unpredictable, or quick as in other Madden games. After the snap, the ballcarrier controls are also a little different--but again, after a game or two, you should be Truck Sticking and calling Hot Routes without a problem.Some on-field factors nagged me to death. First of all, it seems like the passing game is the only way to go. Despite having the helpful Truck Stick, I really only ran the ball on short-yardage situations or if I was tired of throwing the ball. Throwing is almost too easy, as recievers catch almost everything that comes their way and they'll even catch hail mary lobs in triple or quadruple coverage situations. Sure, it's kinda fun to watch your yardage rack up, but it's not fun to steamroll the competition. Even on the harder difficulty settings, I didn't feel much of a challenge.What can't be denied is the visuals. Madden 06 for the Xbox 360 is one attractive football game. The new camera angle, despite causing a few visibility problems, really shows off the beautiful graphics. The player models are a little chunky, but things like jersey detail, sweat, grass and mud stains, and facial expressions compensate for it. The different football fields all look extremely realistic, right down to the jumping and screaming fans, colorful Jumbotrons, and various scoreboards scattered around. Sometimes the animations chug when frames drop, but for the most part, there aren't any graphical qualities to complain about. As a last note about the visuals, I really like the new main menu and how it works. It's all done on one screen, with no page loading at all. Instead of hitting the B button to cancel or go back, you can simply hit the direction of the other menu you'd like to view and go from there. It's delightfully simple.As far as the sound goes, John Madden has finally gotten the tape over the mouth, and I'm happy about it. The new radio-style announcer is much more exciting. I think it was very wise to go with this new guy and not Madden. One small touch I loved was that each quarterback's \"Hike!\" has been brought to the Xbox 360, so you'll instantly recognize Tom Brady's frantic, high-pitched \"HIKE!\" and Peyton Manning's southern pitch. Overall, the graphics and sound couldn't be much better on Madden 06.I must say that I'm impressed but slightly disappointed with this Xbox 360 version of Madden 06. After some time, I really like the new playcalling, the on-field controls, and especially the beautiful graphics. However, I'm let down by the lack of gameplay modes. There could have been so much more to do with this game. Hopefully next season EA Sports can throw in some of the gameplay modes that made Madden so different while improving on a few of the annoyances.(NOTE: I also have this review posted on [...], where I write reviews on a regular basis.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2005"}

This system eliminates the MP magic system, and instead, the only way you gain magic is by using the Draw command to suck it out of your enemies.  In order to use the Junction System, you must have acquired a GF (or Summon in other FFs) and link with them to build your abilites and stats.The story is what made me come back to this game so many times that I've memorized the whole game.

The main character, Squall, has just passed his SeeD exam and is preparing for his first mission.  He meets with a young woman named Rinoa, who is fighting for her state's independence.  Through many twists in the story, they end up in a quest to destroy a sorceress from the future who threatens to compress all time to dominate the universe.From its exciting beginning to its great ending, Final Fantasy VIII is one of the best RPG's to grace the Playstation, or any console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2003"}

Before she was caught, Zelda managed to shatter the Triforce of Wisdom and scatter its eight pieces throughout Hyrule. Link swore to recover the Triforce pieces and rescue Princess Zelda from Ganon's clutches.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"the journey that's still going","reviewText":"What's most appealing to me about the original Zelda is how Link is just this tiny green guy with nothing fancy- just a sword, shield and other basic items. To save the princess, he basically has to go through hell with all the dangerous monsters he's forced to face along the way. A little guy like him has to stand up to THOUSANDS of monsters along the way. You really have to stay on your toes if you want to stay alive and finish the game. I love how such a simple story can stand up for years and years, and the gameplay never gets old because the game provides a perfect challenge.  All you fancy gamers out there today- you don't NEED a fancy story to have a solid video game.  Here's your example of that- find the princess and go through many different enemies and many difficult obstacles and complete them.  It's that easy... or is it?Swinging that sword and moving Link around is SO easy. I actually use the shield in this game.  How many times do I need a shield in video games?  Not often.I love how, every time I walk into a new screen, it's like walking into a new land, with a new challenge. Every area of the land and every area of the castle feels like it was carefully created and distinct. In every other Zelda game I've played, there were parts that were just boring to walk through and a chore to complete. Nothing like that in this game.  As I mention above: you are required to stay on your toes because of the very large amount of enemies just about everywhere you turn.  If you can't handle that, then don't play this game.It also feels really good when you go through a castle and defeat the boss. Even the very first one. It's amazing how the upbeat atmosphere of completing a castle can be so simple, and yet, so brilliant. Thanks to the heroic music, you really feel like you've just accomplished something big. I've been playing this game for over 15 years and even though I'm an adult now, there's a certain childhood feeling that immediately returns whenever I play this game. Having two quests featured in one game just makes the whole experience feel complete- it makes a great game almost perfect now. It blows my mind that a game from 1986 can be so enormous.  In fact, this game takes a lot longer to complete than most games out there today.I think if someone asked me what my favorite game of all-time would be, I might have to go with the original Zelda. Maybe Medal of Honor (the first one on the Playstation) would be my next choice.If you can't handle a difficult game, then don't bother playing the original Zelda.  You won't be able to handle it.  However, even though I'm not really a good gamer by any stretch of the imagination, I can still complete both quests.  It just takes a lot of time and patience.It makes you wonder what the first person who had to write a guide for this game was doing when he or she first found out there are hidden entrances around the land and inside the dungeons. If I remember right, don't you have to hold down on the directional pad for a few moments as you're facing a wall in order to access the hidden entrance? Imagine someone trying to find every single entrance in *every single screen* throughout the entire land. It would take longer than a lazy Sunday afternoon to find them all, that's for sure.Now imagine all the entrances that require bombs to access, and how someone would have to keep going through each screen and using them on every section of the wall, in the slim chance an entrance may be there. Then imagine that, when they run out of bombs, they have to keep going back and finding more, in order to experiment with them on the next section of land! We're talking hours and hours of gaming here. Seriously, people back then who wrote NES guides had to be extremely patient and willing to do the same things over and over again in order to find every little thing inside the game.What a beautiful and fantastic game the original NES Zelda is.

The case feels like its made of quality materials.I have a few gripes however and I hope a revision may come along in the future. Probably wont though. :)The case holds a ton of games, however the problem in when the games are in place there is no way to see the title without pushing the game out to see what it is.  Sure you can memorize whats in where, but it would be nice if the game storage portion was see through.  What they did was sow an elastic type fabric in there so as to hold each game, which works well and keeps them snug, but as I said, you cant see what is what.  You can store the games a bit higher so you can see the top portion of the game and you'll likely know which game it is, but to me they feel less snug in this instance.The Vita has a charge cord that is comprised of three separate pieces.  The part that plugs into the wall, a small plastic box that it plugs into and then on the other side of the box the USB to Vita connection is made.  I have a rough time getting all three pieces into the case in the netting made to hold it.  Now, it does fit but you must be tidy with getting it in there.  What I do is separate all three pieces and then take the two cords and fold them together so they are about as long as a third of length of the storage, then I put those in the case, then I take the box piece and put it in there after, usually resulting in a bit of force to get it far enough to zip the case.  (Taking suggestions if someone found a better way.)  In the end it works, but in my opinion it would be nice if the netting portion was in two parts.  One side specifically made to hold the box and the other side to hold the cords.With those two issues out there, I still think this is a sweet case, and in my opinion the best you can get for your Vita currently.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

The upgrade system is straightforward,but some moves require the goofiest button combo's ever.  The gameplay's relatively smooth in regardsto framerate, but becomes rigid as far as the character's movement is concerned.

I finally did and I'm pretty happy with it. It's nice to get Nintendo in HD. But I've also had a few issues. Here's the rundown:THE GOODI didn't get the appeal of the Gamepad at first. But having played it, I admit it's pretty neat. Playing a game on the Gamepad while somebody else is watching TV or while you're in bed is actually pretty fun. Not necessary, but neat.The graphics are amazing. I'm sure PS4 and XOne will have higher graphics processing power, but I can't imagine I'd never have a need for more.The eShop is very user friendly, easy to navigate, and downloads pretty fast. Also, Amazon and Netflix offer HD and plays well.THE BADThe biggest frustration with the Wii U is that it doesn't allow you to separate video and audio output into separate inputs, so if you want to connect the Wii U to external speakers it's actually quite a bit of trouble. I bought an HDMI expander that separates them and I happened to have spare HDMI and component cables, but the expander cost about $40, increasing the price of the unit.THE VERDICTIf you have the money to spare, I definitely recommend the Wii U. There still aren't many games on it, but I'm sure more will come out. Unlike the Wii's motion controls, the Wii U doesn't revolutionize gaming and there is a very big risk that games will try to force the Gamepad in gimmicky ways.

The XBOX did it well when it got HALO out. This is the best the PS2 has offer in terms of 1st person high quality shooters. For all essential purposes it is like the team levels in HL2 running on a high end 64bit graphics card. How is that for the PS2? Great considering that the box is very dated but is still great for sport sims, button bashers and survival horror (where it rules over the PC). For those who do not have a PC and want to play a 1st person shooter, then Killzone is really the only option.The story is like the resistance levels on HL2 with squads following you around as you take on various battle zones. The camera has lots of running zooms, good quality recoil effects and a camera jump type of reload.

Now that is out of the way I have to explain title for this game.Controls are almost broken cause you have to hold down a button to go forward and the braking is not even worth mentioning in the game cause it feels like you have none.Physics that are in the game are badly done. And what I'm talking about is the drifting in the game. This should not be the only feature cars are based on. Whether you are driving a hummer or mustang (real names but crappy versions in the game unlicensed version really) this should not be your only real choice in a car.When I play a arcade racer its suppose to be fun not furstrating. ARCADE means not feeling cheated,ragequitting or just flatout not wanting to play anymore. That is what the controls in the game make you feel like.Cars in the game are something that are not balanced correctly. What I mean is I shouldn't have something that looks like a 500hp muscle car being beaten by their version of a hummer. This is not even remotely possible without the use of nitro, turbo charging, or something that gives the car more of a racing edge but the problem with that is THERE IS NONE IN THE GAME!!!!! Some reviewers mention this as 'rubberbanding' and I thought that there is no game that does that until I played this. Then I thought my driving skills were enough until the forementioned happened and I just quit playing.Don't get me wrong this applied to the RACING sections of this game. And what really set this game apart from the rest that I saw and they should have done more with were the airstrike race (heli shooting rockets at you. ROCKETS!!!) and the other mode was having a semi throw exploding oil drums at you. Now these races was what made this game interesting to play but alas the controls made it unforgiving at times when you missed a drift or overdrited a corner you truly paid for it. And to me that takes away from the game cause there really is no reward for beating the game/show sucessfully other being able to play the next show/section. No choice of car to pick from if you win the top tier race, no extra boost, speed, upgrade, etc. Just moving along and unlocking more cars that seem slower then the top tier racers.I have to say when I started up this game and was presented with a intro that showed the whole idea behind the game as being a explosive racing game show immediately I was hooked thinking that this was going to be a wild ride to last for a while even when the novelty wore off I would still pick it up to kill some time or beat my best score. But the cons that I mentioned just turned me off so much that I can't bring myself to want to keep it. I mean hell I didn't even finish the third show cause of cons. Really what game takes the balance then turns it around to the point its almost to broken to even want to finish it.Sounds like I'm complaining? YES. This took one of my favorite guilty pleasures(big explosions) and robbed me of a good time. So if you have a friend that has this game(don't see many people holding on to this) then borrow it from them. Don't even waste your time renting it from gamefly cause you will feel obligated to at lest finish it and no game should make you feel like you are working when you should be having fun.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, DS, PC, Activision, T.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Practically on par with the awesome Spider-Man 2","reviewText":"Spider-Man 3 was at best a second fiddle to Spider-Man 2, so now comes Spider-Man: Web of Shadows to give Spidey games the boost they needed with gamers everywhere. Despite a couple of professional reviews giving this game rather low scores (ahem:IGN.COM), this game deserves the praise it has received from its fans. This game is also the first one that has you play as the true comic book Spider-Man since the two older games for the original Playstation; Ultimate Spider-Man doesn't count, since the Ultimate series is comic book blasphemy. The story is very \"comic bookish\" with its outlandish occurrences and crazy circumstances, as well as the classic Spidey one-liners and numerous guest appearances. It's a bit all over the place, but in a fun way. And for other Spidey fans who want to know around which time the story for the game takes place in relation to the comics, take a look at a couple of the advertisements and displays in areas of the city like Times Square. I saw one with Captain America with a caption mentioning an upcoming \"Civil War\"... hmmmmm. Spidey has to battle the usual gangsters, henchmen, and popular supervillains, as well as a symbiote invasion of New York City, which you once again get to explore in its entirety. Without spoiling much of anything, Venom's symbiote begins to inexplicably mutate and part of it detaches from him and covers Spidey, giving him access to the suit once again. Eventually Venom's symbiote mutates to the point where it turns the majority of New York's citizens into their own brands of symbiote freaks. Spidey is affected somewhat differently. He can switch between wearing his regular red and blue costume to the black suit on the fly, which changes his combat abilities as well as his appearance. When wearing his classic suit, Spidey's moves are more accurate, quick, and tend to focus more on individual enemies. When wearing the black suit, Spidey's moves rely more on area of effect attacks with tendrils and shockwaves that can damage multiple opponents at once, which comes in handy when Spidey fights swarms of symbiotes and in certain boss fights with multiple adversaries.The rest of the combat is done fairly well, making full use of Spider-Man's agility and speed. Initially, when Spidey is learning to make full use of his abilities while training with Luke Cage, the gameplay is quite slow and repetitive, but once you start acquiring more of Spider-Man's upgrades with your EXP, it really picks up. The aerial and even wall crawling combat have been greatly revamped as well. Web swinging has remained largely the same as it was in the previous movie games, so that's another plus. Occasionally, the game will glitch up, normally in the form of enemies appearing inside buildings, which you can't enter (you can see the outlines of enemies near or far with the Spider-Sense lock-on). Another thing about the game that is slightly annoying is how frequently random crimes pop up, like every ten seconds. Also, the controls don't always register when you throw a punch or activate Spider-Sense, which you must do if you want to save a citizen when they're falling or being blown out of their exploding vehicles (vehicles and some environments are quite destructible this time). The lock-on system itself tends to not always go to the target you intended to highlight, whether it's an enemy or a citizen you have to defend. Also, once you beat the game...that's it. You can't continue free-roam unless you start a new game. These are rather minor problems though, since the game is still a blast overall. Spider-Man: Web of Shadows takes a cue from Infamous and gives Spidey a morality meter: red for good guys and black for bad guys who fall under the sway of the black suit. Saving citizens and completing good missions gives you red points, while not saving citizens and completing bad missions gives you black points.The cutscenes change somewhat depending on what road you take, but the gameplay isn't largely affected. However, you can call allies to help you fight your enemies in this game (a nice touch) and the roster changes depending on whether you're good or bad. Good guys can call on heroes like Luke Cage and Wolverine to assist them in battle, while bad guys can count on foes like Electro and the Vulture. Quick time events make a return as well in this game's cutscenes, but fortunately they're executed MUCH better here than they were in Spider-Man 3... now you get a full second to react to the button prompts, and like God of War you only have to choose between the face buttons without worrying about the triggers and joysticks. When the story reaches the point where the whole city of New York is put under quarantine and the symbiotes have taken it over (much like a zombie movie), the missions you can take part in are quite fun. You can call in airstrikes on symbiote nests, rescue stranded citizens from rooftops as symbiotes close in for the kill, and accompany S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to rescue stranded citizens in the streets. The game looks great as well, with cartoon-like animations that give all the characters that authentic comic book look, and the overall design of the characters and environments is very colorful and clean. There's certainly a lot to do in this game, so as usual, Spidey fans of all ages should ignore the negative reviews (especially the \"professional\" ones) and buy this game. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"Rejoice: Being a Jedi is Cool","reviewText":"Although I'm not a nutcase Star Wars fan that attends every convention and dresses up like a Wookie, I am nevertheless a fan of Lucas' brilliant saga. I enjoy the movies, and when Jedi Knight 2 was released, I eagerly picked up a copy for my PC. And if you're a fan of Star Wars and you like the idea of becoming a Jedi, then I urge you to pick this one up.Although the first couple of levels are a little boring, the locales are very Star Wars-ish, and killing tons of stormtroopers has never been more fun. Quests of the puzzle-variety are abundant in the first few levels, but once Kyle Katarn (the hero you control) meets up with Luke Skywalker and arms himself with his trusty lightsaber, the game really takes off. An intuitive mouse-control attack makes the saber flow like a true Jedi, and rooms of intergalactic bounty hunters are soon cut to shreds with powerful jumping attacks, backslashes, and somersaults that sever limbs beautifully. Plus, Kyle can now wield the Force with cruel proficiency. Abilities like Force Pull and Push can mean instant death for Imperials standing high atop a catwalk, and the crackling smell of death in Force Lightning is a sight to behold as you lash out before slicing a Jedi Reborn in two. As Vader says, \"All too easy.\"The graphics are incredible, but know this: Without a powerful PC, this game may not run as smooth as you like. Of course, turning down a lot of the eye-candy will help, but for those of you with a chunky graphics card and a smokin' system are in for some real dazzling effects and landscapes. Gorgeous visuals shape the universe, from Cloud City to the seedy cantinas. Cut-scenes are handled nicely, with decent voice acting and some good-looking rendering effects.As for the sound, get ready to be immersed in blaster fire frenzy. Thanks to a recent patch, JKII allows owners of Audigy soundcards to crank up the effects with EAX sound, which really adds a tremendous amount of realism to the game. Stormtroopers chat while guarding that all-too-important outpost, and you'll be able to recognize where the blaster fire is coming from, thanks to fully recognized 5.1 support. The familiar whirr of the lightsaber is enough to warrant purchase of this one!And also know this: The game ain't easy. On numerous occasions, you'll find yourself surrounded by dozens of enemies, all firing away with their trusty sidearms or tossing some nice thermal detonators your way. Needless to say, you've got to have pretty quick trigger fingers yourself to avoid countless reloads.For the entire package, Jedi Knight II is a game that should not be missed, especially for fans of first-person shooters or the Star Wars saga. Wielding a lightsaber has never been more fun, and when you enter the multiplayer world that JKII has to offer, you can test your skills against thousands of Jedi in a one-on-one arena.In terms of action, graphics, sound, and overall fun, JKII does not disappoint. Although it takes a little while to get into, once you do, you'll be sad to see it end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2002"}

While the game wasn't wholly original, I always say that if you're going to borrow make sure you do it well or better.  Dead Space delivers quite a bit in that regard.  It also includes influence by two of best science fiction films, in my opinion, Aliens and Event Horizon.  I think Dead Space really captured the terrifying and brooding atmosphere that was inherent in Event Horizon.  Not to mention the scare factor in Aliens with creatures jumping out at you.  With Dead Space's ability to fully immerse it's users into its environment this resulted in an incredible gaming experience.Pros:Intense immersive environmentZero Gravity levelsHighly detailed areasUpgradeable weaponsExcellent use of a Nav PointUnique look at enemies, where you need to dismember themGame Length is about 12 to 15 hoursA couple fun mini-gamesMakes full use of the controller, giving you lots of optionsHas Kinesis (basically the Gravity Gun from HL2, but still fun)Has Stasis (can freeze enemies)Cons:Other weapon options not that greatA strange variant on asteroids (for a few minutes in one section)Controls can be hard to get used toBackground story is fuller if you watch/read other Dead Space materialWhen completing a game and wanting to play on a higher difficulty level you cannot use the same character, but you can reuse it to replay the same difficulty level.The things that made Dead Space great were some simple adjustments to very basic things in video games.  First off, something people may not notice at first is that there is nothing on the screen except your character.  This is a third person view, where you control someone walking around.  There's no HUD to show how much ammo you have, or life meter, none of that is cluttering the screen.  Instead they've put the life meter on the suit you are wearing and you readily see the ammo counter when you aim your weapons.  Very simple changes, in my opinion, but they helped immerse me in the environment just that little bit more.  The other thing that I really loved was the way they handle the Nav (Navigation) Point feature on many games today.  Rather than have some point off in the distance that your character is supposed to head towards, this game allows you to push a button and it brings up a glowing line that will point you in the direction you are supposed to go.  In a ship this large this is quite a boon, because otherwise the user would easily get lost or turned around.One of the greatest features is the upgradeable weapons aspect of the game.  Throughout the game you come across work benches.  You can find or purchase things called \"nodes\" and you can insert these things into your weapons at work benches.  Doing this increases your capacity, damage, and reload time.  I thought this was a really cool aspect of the game.  Rather than have hundreds of different weapons or series of weapons you can find, you merely upgrade the ones you have.  This aspect was also quite a bit of fun.A really fun part of this game is they have sections that are fully in zero gravity.  So you can jump around all over the place.  This was really awesome to experience, though sometimes disorienting, but that's part of the experience.  I think they really used the fact you're in space to the highest level with this game, which was part of the reason this was so fun.  One of the strange mini-games that are within this game is something called Zero-G Ball.  It's some strange variant on Basketball, but I couldn't fully get the points up high enough.  I guess that's one achievement I'll be missing out on.Now Dead Space, as with anything, isn't without some flaws.  The first is the attempt at getting some emotional response from the audience.  You play as someone named Isaac Clarke, which would be great for getting into character.  However, similar to the characters in other shooters, you have a hard time getting into the character where you want to meet Isaac's girlfriend who was on this ship.  I think Half Life 2 did a better job with Alyx Vance, where you really interact with her throughout the game, so you wind up liking her towards the end quite a bit.  Isaac's girlfriend doesn't have the same appeal, she feels more like any other side character you'd come across.  Of course this makes sense, because part of the reason Dead Space is so terrifying is you always feel alone, so logically some aspect was going to have to suffer.  Don't get me wrong, the girl is essential to the story line in some regards, but it fails to get you emotionally vested in the character.Another part comes in the form of the overall storyline.  This is a great story, but I don't think you'll really grasp that from just playing the game.  I went out and I read the comic book series and watched the animated movie, so I had already been somewhat immersed in the Dead Space environment before even putting the game in my Xbox.  I don't think the average user is going to get this same kind of experience out of the game.  I really enjoy having supplementary material available for after I finish a game, but I also don't think it should be dependent for getting into the game itself.  The game should, frankly, be its own stand alone product.The other gripe I had with this game was the other weapons.  Yes, I know they're supposed to function as tools, but I found them to be very unwieldy, especially when I'm trying to fight extremely fast creatures that charge you at great speeds.  I'm sorry; I don't have time for a charging period.  Frankly I just stuck with the plasma cutter and pulse rifle after I managed to get my 30 kills achievement with each weapon.  One last part I didn't particular like much was their asteroids type part.  Thankfully it only lasted a couple minutes and only took me a few tries, but I found this part of the game more annoying than fun.  I think that had to do with the fact I didn't like the guns slow movement, so I didn't feel like I could really control the gun that well.Over all I think this game is exceptionally well done, despite some of the minor flaws.  The environment is incredibly immersive and it really is a scary game to play, especially late at night with all the lights shut off.  It keeps the tension at such a high level, that you can't help but get into it.  The sounds and overall ambience of the environment are incredibly well done, which only adds to the effect when things jump out at you and attack.  I think the length of the game is very acceptable, being somewhere between 12 and 15 hours to complete.  I also think it has some degree of replay value.4.5 out of 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2009"}

Youll spend about half the game looking for dad and the other half completing PP, but due to some plot devices which are major spoilers, the subpar story starts to fall and becomes crap at the very end.The side quests for the most part arent very interesting.  Some are good (reilys rangers, stealing independence) while others are boring (tenpenny tower, those!).  For the most part they come down to \"go here, kill some stuff, bring me back this certain item.\"  The only upside to the sidequests is that while you get achievements/trohpies for completing them, you also obtain extremely useful items but they tend to just be advanced types of weapons that you most likely already have and 3-4 end up tying for \"the best gun in the game\" which mostly depends on your opinion.  One also rewards you with the best armor in the game so by doing these quests, youll for the most part be indestructible.The karma levels and the radiation levels are just worthless gimmicks that affects almost nothing and are extremely flawed.  If you find yourself up to the point of critical raditiation poisioning, all you have to do is spend about 2-3 seconds using your medicinal supplies or seeing a doctor and your radiation is gone.  Also, radiation does absolutely nothing, although its probably safe to assume that you die at even larger amounts of poisoning, I for one wouldnt know because the entire system is just an annoyance that can be removed shortly.  Your karma levels dont really determine anything.  You could go kill an entire city and still be considered a saint.  You could nuke a city (which is optional early in the game), then give some bottled water to a few people and your instantly decent again.  The only thing that it does effect is the outcome of the ending which amounts to a slightly different dialouge sequence.Melee/unarmed weaponry is worthless.  It not only requires you to run up directly to the enemy while they gun you down, but you have to repeatatly(SP) hit them because most weapons are otherwise weak with the exception of the deathclaw gauntlet.  Theres really no point in doing melee/unarmed because 80-90% of the enemies in the game are using guns anyways.  The heavy class guns (mini nuke, minigun, flamer, missle launcher, gatling laser) are useless to use as well.  Not only do they have excessive weight, but the ammo for them is scarce and they all chew through ammo extremely fast.  Not to mention, in order to use the flamer you have to be upclose (its flaws already being explained from melee/unarmed) but it does damage to you as well.On a side note, the game has caught me in numerous glitches, most of which has been my character being stuck in something and unable to move at all, while another acctually made me unable to complete the game because an NPC would not move.  My xbox has also frozen numerous times as well and has caused it to crash atleast once.In conclusion, the game is fairly decent but could have been alot better if the quests were acctually fun, more quests were avaliable(inclusing the main storyline theres maybe 25), the story didnt suck, and if the glitches/bugs/freezes didnt exist.  I would reccoment renting or borrowing from a friend for a while and then making a descion.  Theyve already released one patch (which did nothing) and atleast 3 DLC is supposed to come within the next 3 months.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"Why did we have to wait so long?","reviewText":"I played GTA 3 on PS2 before getting my Xbox and it was a decent game.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"strong launch title for the PS3","reviewText":"Resistance: Fall of Man was a launch title for the Playstation 3.  Given the fact that the game is now almost 5 years old, it obviously doesn't hold its ground from a technological standpoint with newer games like Call of Duty, Halo Reach, Killzone 2, or even its own sequel, Resistance 2.  However, Resistance: Fall of Man has remained one of the PS3's most beloved titles, and that is because the game gets the fundamentals right, and games that do this never seem to age like their other peers do.Resistance: Fall of Man is a very solid first person shooter.  The high point for me was the game's story.  It has a very cool alt history vibe to it that is reflected well in the game's setting, which often almost makes one forget what's going on and makes you think that you're playing a WWII game, thanks to the grainy \"film\" look of the game.  The alternate history/sci-fi story is told in the past tense through a narrator that tells the tale of one Nathan Hale, who's events you act out in the game.  The game takes place in settings throughout England in the 1950's, as you fight off hordes of invading beings known as the Chimera.  The gameplay is excellent and the environments are really cool.  The shooting mechanics feel very old school and work very well.  The weapons are just awesome and the inventory system is extremely easy to use.  The enemy AI is tough and will tear you apart if you are careless.  There are battles here of all different sizes and scales, but the high points are the huge battles in which you are joined by British soldiers on your side in large fights against hordes of Chimera on large battlefields.  These sections of the game are very impressive and also a great deal of fun.  There are also vehicle sections in Resistance that are incredible and true highlights of the game.Resistance really does everything it sets out to do very well.  Of course, Resistance is not a game changer.  This isn't Half Life 2 or Bioshock.  It is exactly what it promises to be though....a very solid, fun shooter with an excellent story that will leave you wanting to pick up the sequel right away.  Anyone looking for a really fun, memorable single player first person shooter should pick up this excellent launch title right away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"WITHOUT a dOUBT , tha Best Game for the PS3 RIGHT NOW","reviewText":"Resistance is one of those games that are worth buying a system for. Sounds like a lot but it s a very good game. The Playstation 3 isn't exactly the system to buy right now, The Nintendo Wii is a lot cheaper and has the most innovative gameplay a system can have, and the XBox 360 has a year over the PS3 with almost triple the library that the PS3 has right now. But even with all that, the PS3 is still a system that has the most potential out of the 3, once the games come in its gonna be on.Now the actual game is a great one, the story isn't exactly the best or the most original but it does its job. The graphics are great but still lacks the graphical power of games like \"Gears of War\". The game has great controls, that should feel natural to people that have played FPS shooters on the PS2, even to those that haven't played the controls will feel like second nature once you play 5 minutes through, plus the game makes good use of the new Six-Axis controller (Example; when an enemie jumps on you, you can shake the controller to shake off the enemy). Since this game is from the same people that brought you \"Ratchet & Clank\" the weapons in this game are unique and very fun to play with, each weapon has a special secondary fire for example the Shotgun has a double fire, Sniper Rifle can slow down time for better accuracy and the most stand out weapon of the game is the AUGER which can shoot through walls and can create a shield for its secondary fire. The sound/music in this game isn't exactly that special especially compared to the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series.Another thingabout this game is the ONLINE PLAY, online for this game is one of the best supporting up to 40 players playing at once. There are about 8 different levels with different settings depending on the number of players. The Pace online is crazy as f*** especially when there are a lot of people, you can also customize your character for online with plenty of options, honestly I Like this better than Halo's online play (People are gonna hate me) the reason is because even though the physics in this game aren't exactley realistic, the pace and the delivery is a lot more friendly than Halo's. All in all this game isn't exactley a killer app FPS like Halo, but it has a special feel to it that you can't copy their style or gameplay, so if you have a Playstation 3 and don't have this game, get it right away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"masterkey","summary":"What's all the fuss?","reviewText":"This review contains spoilers, so if you are sensitive, stop reading now. Many people are complaining about the ending of Mass Effect 3 but I do not see the problem. Some people are complaining about the fact that Shepard dies. So what he dies at the end. The public doesn't decide the ending to games, movies, books, or television. The developers make that decision, as they should being that it's their product. Other people are complaining that they didn't understand the ending or didn't get the good ending where Shepard lives. I don't know how many endings there are but here is the ending that I got after playing the game for 90+ hours, completing every priority and side mission, retrieving every war asset, and having every conversation in single player only, no multiplayer. I also played and ported Mass Effect 1 & 2. At the end of Mass Effect 3 you meet the catalyst in the form of a ghostly child. The child explains why the Reapers exist but not who exactly created the Reapers. You are given three choices and you are told that you will die upon making your choice. The choices are:1) You may chose to destroy the Reapers but if you allowed the Geth to live they will also be destroyed along with EDI and any other synthetics. This will be evident when Joker crash lands on the planet and EDI does not exit the Normandy.2) You may chose to take control of the Reapers allowing their existence and any other synthetics' to continue. This will be evident when Joker crash lands on the planet and EDI exits the Normandy.3) You may chose to bring about the final stage of human evolution by merging synthetics and organics. This will be evident when Joker crash lands on the planet and he, EDI and another character exit the ship with signs of synthetics mixed in with their organics such as glowing eyes and circuitry running through their skin.Bottom line is Shepard dies no matter the choice but he is given the power by the catalyst to chose how life in general will continue. A fitting end to a great series.There were a few bugs like the Dekunna mission in the Minos Wasteland that never happened. The mission was in the Journal and you were supposed to help save the Elcor but that mission just never showed up. You could never land on the planet and when you went back to the Citadel to talk to the Elcor that gave you the mission in the first place, the mission is complete. This is something that should have been caught by the developers since it is so obvious. The Minos Wasteland also kept blinking as if there was a mission to be done. Other bugs were not being able to get into and out of cover. This was very frustrating at times. All in all I enjoyed the entire game including the endings. I was not confused and I don't understand others' confusion.Mass Effect 3 should not be given poor reviews solely because some individuals did not like the ending. The game should be rated on overall performance, not just the ending, which I had no problem with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

The entire story is laid out in the beginning - the whole game is just recruiting people (no plot). In fact, I felt kind of let down at a number of points in the story. For instance, the blank screen / date scene with Tali totally had me psyched out (what's she look like). Or the passive ship upgrades that help you survive the suicide mission but that you never get to actually use (kept waiting for a 'hands on' ship-to-ship).

The Orange Box is, without a doubt, the WORST game purchase I have ever made here.  Not only do I feel completely cheated, not only do I feel as if I am in fact owed several hundred dollars in frustration fees, I actually think my overall interest in video games has been damaged by this monstrous piece of marketing vomit masquerading as a playful gamer utopia.

I don't know who came up with this, but I hope they get hit by a bus and buried in a fire ant den.  Simply put, \"Steam\" is an Orwellian nanny program that requires you to basically convert your computer into an Internet-enabled marketing survey to even access the games you \"own\" (but that Steam controls).  Once upon a golden time, when you bought a game you could put the CD in your computer and simply play it, perhaps with an activation key.  But with Steam, you have to set up an entire account larded with nefarious third party vendors just to have a fighting chance of even downloading the games that are supposedly just included in the Orange Box.

Plus the game is high on the fun factor and true to SOCOM tradition it's challenging without being unnecessarily difficult to progress through story mode (though Mission 11 took me several attempts to beat it).Some reviewers commented on problems with the AI but I haven't noticed any. Though there was a long install update before I began game play so perhaps they are fixed now. That was true with SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault as well. The SOCOM games always seem to be glitchy when released, but they put out an update that cleans up the glitches post-release. It's true that the AI has been simplified compared to SOCOM 3 or Combined Assault, but the AI works better in SOCOM 4 than those games, so I like it better. And Alpha & Bravo teams are very effective in this game, much more so than in other SOCOM games. This is my favorite aspect of the SOCOM franchise, that you can stay back and tactically choose how to use your teams to take out the enemy. And then you as the commander can choose to lay back and provide support or snipe enemies or choose to take point and lead the assault. That is still present here in SOCOM 4 and works better than ever in my opinion.My only criticisms of the game are that I would like to have seen more vehicles used - in SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault there were Humvees, stealth vehicles, and boats to drive. There was no driving in this game and I missed that. And at times this game can seem much more linear than Combined Assault or SOCOM 3 which had much more of an open feel to it. In SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault it was much more of an open map and you could pick and choose how to approach the enemy forces. But in SOCOM 4 its very linear and this openess of past SOCOMs is lost. Plus the missions are quite short, so game play time is short. You could easily finish up the story mode in less than 10 hours.  Overall, however, I was very pleased with SOCOM 4, especially after that abomination: Confrontation.FINAL GRADE: A-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

A fun, addicting masterpiece.","reviewText":"But Far Cry 3 is pure addiction. I spent over 30 hours playing the single player campaign and loved every minute of it (even the frustratingly hard replays of a stealth mission once on the second island... hopefully it won't be as bad for you, but it was SO rewarding once I completed it).A couple of admissions.1) I'm not normally a &#34;loot-game&#34; kind of guy.2) I &#34;think&#34; I love open-world games, yet the task and sheer size is usually daunting and this is the first open-world game that I ever &#34;completed&#34; (well all of the missions and 76% completion so far, which is dang good).You are constantly searching for loot (money, items that can be sold, and collectible items). I never got tired of looking for that glowing treasure chest! I don't normally like collection and hunting for items... but I loved it so much that I bought some of the maps in game with my loot earning to better help me find MORE loot.I love video games and play a ton of them. I think I like the idea of open world games more than I do actually playing them.. But, surprisingly, the number of games I've finished since I started with the SNES is about 10. This is one of them and the first one I finished since Uncharted 1 and Bioshock 1&2.An open-world master course for game designers should be based off of this. I love the GTA series but this was (somehow) campier, entertaining, addicting and overall more fun constantly than GTA 4 (I still love 3 and I haven't played 5 yet).While you get &#34;lost&#34; and off of the main story in FC3, you have vast reasons to explore.... hunting and crafting bigger and better equipment to hold more ammo, weapons, etc. It becomes addicting.Taking out Outposts full of bad guys. No raid on an Outpost played out the same way. I ususally attempted stealth then just started guns blazing once it all went to hell. And I had to do this 34 times...Unlocking Radio Towers so you can &#34;see&#34; the map. Brilliant. Fun. Never repetitive (despite 18 radio towers and 34 outposts).The shooting and guns were also a blast. Explosions are plentiful. Action is high-octane, over the top, and near constant (you can avoid many fights or you can be Rambo 24/7, your choice!Advice from a novice game player- If you are starting out for the first time I would recommend getting all radio towers, hunt strategically to craft to build up weapons and the amount of ammo you can carry, then start clearing out all outposts. I did most of this before really getting into the meat of the missions.I don't know how they did it, but they did. I can't WAIT for a follow-up game.And beware of crocodiles. They still scare me even after I've experience them many times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"It Depends on Who You Are","reviewText":"There are two major reasons that I got the Xbone and neither of those reasons are for gaming. For gaming, I still use and will continue to primarily use Steam. Anyways I've broken down my thoughts about the X1 into sections.[Good]Kinect:1) Improved Tracking: A lot of the old Kinect limitations with distance and brightness are now mostly gone.2) Fitness: Not even the new Wii U can lay claim to this. Steam and PS4 can't do this well either, nor do they really even try. In fact nothing but Xbone can touch this area or further expand on it. Workouts like P90X and Insanity are now integrated with Kinect. Future Kinect features like being able to track your heartbeat just push it further ahead. This is one of the major reasons that I bought the X1.3) (Future) Children's Apps: Yes there aren't any now, but the Sesame Street series was huge on the 360 Kinect. There are also apps from both Double Fine and Half Brick that were really nice for keeping kid's attention. These apps serve as either educational or great distractions for children which is priceless. (It keeps your kids and even other people's kids from running around your house and breaking things.) I am pretty confident that we'll be seeing more soon. This is the second major reason that I got the Xbone. Again in this area, I don't see either Wii U, PS4, or Steam even trying. Many people will retain their sanity around kids with Kinect.4) (Far Future) Out of all the cameras, nothing goes better with VR than Kinect. Sadly, MS has no announce VR solution. I know they had a AR solution in the works but I have a feeling that they have to start from scratch now since AR and VR are two very different things. Sony has already announced VR for PS4. Where is MS on this one?!?!New Controller: I've heard the complaints, but I don't understand why. No it doesn't feel like it cost $100 million dollars to develop (lol this has to be the biggest marketing joke ever). However it is better than the old 360 controllers which were already pretty good. It's also still better than the Wii U's, PS4's controller (even though PS4's has more features), and probably than the Steam Controller (which will probably be worse than all of them).Silent: Unlike the 360, which sounded like a vacuum cleaner (or a leaf blower when you paired it with extra fans); the Xbox One is silent. It is awesome.Forza: This is an awesome launch title that really shows off the console. I don't care about Gran Turismo anymore. UPDATE: 3/19 It's nice that it comes for free with the console now. Still if MS wants to keep up, what they really need is a price cut and a future VR solution.UPDATE: 3/19 Speech Recognition has been greatly improved since the last software update. It seems to work as advertised now.[Bad]Xbox Live:1) (FIXED Summer 2014) Unnecessary Paywall: Outside of games, NOTHING WORKS without an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, Crackle, and a ton of services that Microsoft doesn't host are still locked behind the Xbox Live paywall i.e. you have to pay the $60 per year Xbox Live tax to get access to them. X1 is crippled unless you pay Microsoft's $60 yearly extortion fee. I can understand paying for multiplayer and maybe even for the Fitness Hub (eh not really for the fitness apps that you have to pay for), but there's no excuse to extort money for the other stuff. It's free on Apple TV, Roku, Google TV aka Android TV, and even on Wii U and PS4. This really needs to be fixed and is the most broken thing on Xbox One. It's the one biggest ripoff for consoles and it kills the notion of the X1 being the one box for everything. Who in their right mind would pay $60 a year and not just get the same access to Netflix and Amazon for free on the Roku or Apple TV. Aside from the $100 price difference, this will be another huge reason people get the PS4 and I don't blame them.2) Previously purchased games do not migrate to X1: All the downloadable games, primarily the Live Arcade ones, that I bought for 360 are forever stuck on the 360, a dead box. Compare this to Steam, where a lot of the games I bought I can play on Mac, Linux, and so far on every new version of Windows. My paid Steam games will still work if I ever decide to buy a nice new fancy PC in the future.  It's the 21st century and it's now the norm to expect your software purchases to migrate to new hardware. It's not even just Steam, the 800 lb gorillas iOS and Android do it too. If I can help it, I will never purchase downloads from MS again, disc only. In Microsoft's defense PS4 and Wii U don't do this either. This is yet another reason for gamers to go Steam.3) No point in buying download versions of disc games: The price is about the same and there's no great feature to really differentiate it like Family Share. Oh yeah Family Share is already on Steam. It's in BETA but it's active right now.Kinect Issues:1) (FIXED Summer 2014) It adds $100 to the cost. If you heavily rely on Kinect like me, this isn't an issue. However I don't think most gamers will be relying on Kinect any time soon if ever if history is a good predictor of the future. This is the first major reason that people will buy a PS4.2) Speech recognition works but it's limited, and Kinect doesn't do anything for it. As with the old Kinect, Kinect doesn't actually process the speech, it only acts as a fancy microphone. The actual speech recognition is still done by either the X1 itself or on MS's Azure Cloud, so Kinect doesn't even offload some of the processing for it (so the underpowered X1 does even more work not related to graphics). Technically if you stuck a microphone on the controller, you'd get the same capability, if not better. It also doesn't work well if you have a few people over or a couple of kids in the background. Kinect needs it to be quiet to work well for voice pickup.3) Use in Gaming: As I've already pointed out, speech recognition doesn't count since Kinect doesn't even process any of the speech. Historically I can't think of any major games that used the Kinect's motion recognition ability in a great way. Why? Because it costs too much for 3rd party developers to really customize for one console as opposed to just having the same game on all of them. Only MS and its subsidiary game developer houses will be able to do it. Sadly even MS itself can't really figure it out, since Kinect games were absent from its E3 presentation. At launch there's only the Wii Sports knockoff and Forza still uses a controller. I predict Kinect will only be used for Dancing games, Fitness apps, and Children's apps and games. Real games will probably not use Kinect's motion detection. UPDATE: 3/19 If MS had a VR solution, Kinect would finally be useful for gaming beyond yet another dancing app.4) You still need a lot of room for Kinect, just not as much room like the older one needed.5) Most features like the kids games and even the workout apps aren't here yet. They're not even on the release schedule yet. If you're looking forward to any of that, you'll be waiting about two years.It doesn't feel Next-Gen in graphics and just in general: PS4 doesn't either. This is apparent with both X1's 720P upscaling limitation and PS4 stuttering at 1080P. My two year old $426 PC with $149 video card does way better in this department in both quality and performance. It also doesn't help that the same games have awesome user created mods for PC. I'd say the major tablets will all catch up in hardware horsepower within three years.Game Prices: So far nothing beats the prices and the frequency of sales for Steam or GOG on the PC. Getting a new or used game is just so expensive for the consoles and they're the same games as PC. This is the other reason that a lot of people like me will continue to use Steam as their primary gaming platform. Buying games on Steam and GOG (and even Green Man) is just way way cheaper, especially if you just wait one to two months after release.For all the emphasis MS marketing has put on TV, TV integration isn't great:1) X1 softens the image. Many people won't notice, but a lot of techies will.2) X1 automatically outputs stereo, making your fancy surround AV system near useless. The good news is that there will be software fix soon.3) Speech Recognition is not good: It only recognizes some channels. If you have more than one HBO then you may have issues getting to HBO2 and HBO3. Using the controller to navigate is still easier than using voice. UPDATE: Speech Recognition has been fixed with a recent update. However in many cases, it's still a lot easier to just use a controller to make your selections, especially late at night when everyone else is sleeping.4) Even if you disable standard definition channels from One Guide, when you use voice commands, it will still take you to the SD version of the channel instead of the HD version of the same channel.5) (Fixed 2014) Netflix and Amazon Prime videos look horrible: for some reason neither app plays videos in HD. They all stream in SD on Xbox One. Yet on my Apple TV, Roku, and Google TV stream Netflix and Amazon Prime in HD just fine. To add insult to injury, you have to pay Microsoft to be able to access services from other companies that you are already paying for. This isn't acceptable.Lack of Good Exclusive Launch Titles: Ryse sucks. Dead Rising is so so.Horsepower: PS4 currently has a slight edge and it's a $100 cheaper. It's really a minor complaint since both machines are pretty weak. What makes it even worse for the X1 is that it does a lot of extra processing that the PS4 doesn't have to do like analyzing your voice with Kinect commands since the Kinect itself doesn't do it.Slow Load Times: Load times for the launch games are horrible, especially for Forza. It doesn't make any sense since it's reading everything from the hard drive unless it's still doing DRM checks while the game is playing.Really Slow Install Times: It shouldn't take an hour to install a game from a disc. Why does it take an hour? DRM. For some reason it takes Microsoft an hour to verify that you actually bought the game through the internet which is really annoying. It's faster to download and install games on my PC using Steam.No Harddrive Upgrade Option: With PS4 you can replace the stock hard drive with anything you want like an SSD. With X1 it's currently not possible to upgrade the hard drive. Even if it were, you'd probably be forced to buy MS's overpriced hard drives.VR: Microsoft, true next-gen isn't TV integration. True next-gen is VR. PC has one and now even PS4 has a solution coming. Where is VR for Xbox One?!?![Misc]I am lucky: Unlike many PS4 and Xbone owners, my unit seems to be free of defects (at least for now). Then again we'll all know for sure since the defects will surface within two years if they exist.Do not buy this from Gamestop, especially if it's a ripoff bundle. I'd say it's only smart to buy at  Amazon and Costco.I got X1 for free after a bunch of trade-ins at Gamestop, specifically the ripoff bundle. I would not have gotten this system if I had to pay for it.[Verdict]If you just want something for games, I would at least give Steam a look. Upgrading a desktop PC that you already own with a decent graphics card (about $150 - $200) is also way cheaper than either PS4 or X1. Xbox controllers also work on PC. I know that if I was a poor middle school, high school or college kid, Steam would be the best thing since you can get so many games on the cheap (most of the console games except for a few exclusives are on Steam), it works with TVs now (a lot of video cards have HDMI out too), and games on PC look and play better than on X1 or even PS4. Steam also has major sales every quarter, so a problem I have is that I have too many games than I have time to play. Oh yeah unlike PS4 and Xbone, you don't have to pay for multiplayer and you can share games with up to 10 people in your friends list. Steam works on Mac, Windows, and now Linux.If you're one of the few old people like me who has money to blow, you care about hi-tech fitness, and something to keep little kids occupied and from driving you insane, then the Xbox One is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

This took me a few minuets to get the hang of. It definitely has a small learning curve in learning to look for how to twist the groups of 4 to get the pairs your looking for. But once your spend some time doing it, you can get the hang of it.The game has the same basic idea as Bejeweled for PC, but adds some extras to bring a fun element to the game.

The one thing that initially held me back from purchasing a PS4 console was this controller. I am a HUGE fan of the Xbox 360 controller due to how perfectly it fits in the hands and the alternated joy sticks. It made for very comfortable game play. When I saw that Microsoft kept this layout for the Xbox One console, I was leaning toward getting it for that reason alone. However, I chose PS4 for multiple reasons instead and I am very happy I did. I was worried about the controller at first, but now I realized I had nothing to fear. It's a wonderful controller!This controller is very ergonomically friendly. It does not feel like a flimsy/cheaply made controller like PS3/PS2/PS1 controllers. It is slightly larger, allowing for an easier and more comfortable grip. The joysticks have a slight depression in them, allowing your thumbs to hold them more easily without slipping like on the older controllers. It's rechargeable. You can either plug it into your wall outlet or the console itself via USB charger. It comes with a headphone/microphone jack as well.

In his dreams, happenstance encounters with a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her, leads to Chopin's discovery of the light that shines in each of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. With gorgeous next gen visuals and style, a unique battle system, and a captivating story, Eternal Sonata promises to give Xbox 360 fans the RPG they've been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"One of my favorite RPGs of all time","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing music, visuals, story, and characters, Japanese voice overs!, not too hard, not too easy, unique battle systemThe Bad: Battles can get a bit tedious, some parts of the game are labyrinthine and confusingI don't know how else to put this, but Eternal Sonata is probably one of the best (if not THE best) RPG's of this generation (yes next-gen is now this gen it's been almost four years now c'mon). The best part about Eternal Sonata are the graphics, story, music, and unique battle system.To make this as easy as possible to understand I'll start with the story. ES does something different that I've never seen in a game before and that's fuse a fictitious story with something that's non fiction. ES is about the famous pianist Chopin from the early 1800's; ES follows the life of Chopin during when he was struck with tuberculosis, left Warsaw, Poland due to the war with Austria at the time. While the real Chopin is sick in bed you enter into his mind, and into the world which he created while trying to recover. Chopin is now Frederic and you run into several unique and lovable characters while trying to defeat the evil Count Waltz. Forte Castle (where Waltz lies) is supposed to represent Austria and Chopin wants to go back and defeat the evil leader so he can go home. The reason why Chopin runs into these colorful characters is because they all have separate reasons to see the Count (I won't explain why due to spoilers). After you beat each chapter stills of Europe will play as well as a piece of Chopin's music and pieces of his life will be told. Everything flows and ties in perfectly and it makes it one of my favorite RPG stories of all time.Now I'm going to go right into the battle system with this being the meat of the game. ES doesn't have a random battle system (THANK GOD!) since I think we're finally beyond that. Every enemy you see is in real time and you can avoid them if you want (like in numerous other RPGs). Instead of having magic, ability points, and some sort of super attack ES does away with all that. You have a battle counter which lets you decide what you need to do, after this runs out your action counter (about 5 seconds) counts down when you start moving and you use the A button to attack with your main weapon. Magic or Special Abilities or whatever you want to call them are on your Y button and use can use these as many times as you want throughout your turn. So, if you attack until you're turn is just about up then hit the Y button you can do some devastating damage. Of course you have items that heal, poison, revive KOs and there are tons of them, but there's nothing special about these that you haven't seen before. When it comes to guarding you have a \"CHANCE\" button (B) and if you hit the button when it appears on screen you will block the enemies attack greatly reducing the damage by about 90%. Sometimes the button will stay longer than other times, but it's all about timing and this helps keep the action up.When you get your party leveled up battle rules change from losing time on your counters to being able to chain special attacks, to moving faster in battle. Every time you hit an enemy you \"queue\" up power and then when you use your special attack it's that many time more powerful. Every character gets two abilities: Light, and dark. On the battlefield you'll see shadows and light areas; when you are in a dark area you'll use a dark attack; and when you are in a light area you'll use a light attack. This is really great and can help keep things mixed up. Watch out though some enemies transform into stronger monsters when they are in the dark.The level design in this game can vary sometimes since some of the game has labyrinthine dungeons that require a FAQ to even remotely understand how to navigate. A lot of these are partly due to puzzles that require a lot of backtracking that get really get under your skin.Now that the battle system is out of the way let's talk production values.Eternal Sonata uses some outstanding music, especially when Chopin's pieces are used. The graphics are just absolutely gorgeous with bright colorful palettes, and unique architecture I've never seen in a game before. Eternal Sonata is also one of the JRPG's that also include Japanese voice acting and I highly HIGHLY recommend this over the American voice actors. Just turn the English subtitles on and you're good to go since the Japanese voice actors fit the characters better and is just superb. The game is easier than most JRPG's, but maybe this is a good thing. Everyone wants a stupidly hard RPG that takes over 100 hours to beat and that's not always necessary.Eternal Sonata will take you 20-30 hours to beat depending on your play style and even has a \"game finished\" save so you can go back from the beginning at whatever level you finished. It's sad to know Eternal Sonata got great reviews, but had poor sales so I hope you pick this up and experience of the best RPG's of all time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The story starts with Payne working private security and a kidnapping in the family he his been paid to protect (Man on Fire comes to mind). However clich&eacute; this may sound it's not. Max's story is a dark, desperate, violent, gritty fight for survival which is expertly paced, narrated and unpredictable. It is truly a cinematic experience watching Max Payne as he fights for both the survival of the people he was paid to protect and himself! I was engrossed and immersed.The gameplay is fantastic! Bullet dodge is back and better than ever, basically turning enemies into mesh in slow motion is immensely satisfying and cover adds more value to the gameplay. This means you can take a completely different approach to the action and constantly go from cover to cover picking off the enemies one after another, helps those going for a more realistic approach. However it tends to get a tad repetitive towards the end.I cannot however stand the mulitplayer (hence the four stars). I feel like it is lacking in many aspects and just doesn't feel as well done and polished like other Rockstar titles such as Red Dead Redemption and GTA IV.

{"product_name":"B0088MVP3S","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"The weakest game in the series overall, but still a generally good game","reviewText":"This game was somewhat disappointing and just the slightest bit frustrating, but at the same time it was still quite fun and altogether well made. The game's biggest issue to me was its story and narrative. You begin the story as Dracula defending his castle from an army of Brotherhood of Light soldiers and their giant Siege Titan. After completely destroying the army and coming face to face with his son Alucard, time jumps to the present day where Dracula has recently awoken from centuries of slumber and finds himself in Castlevania City, which has been built over the ruins of his old castle. His old enemy Zobek (still voiced by Patrick Stewart, thankfully) seeks him out and forms an alliance with him in order to kill the acolytes of their common enemy, Satan, in order to prevent his return to Earth. As interesting as the plot may sound, the accompanying narrative proves to be somewhat uninteresting with the game itself largely consisting of Dracula accomplishing lots of fetch quest missions like tracking down the acolytes, their servants, or special items. He will also be able to travel to the past through certain time portal altars and visit his castle in order to reacquire his old powers and other items important to his quest. The story is rather unclear and vague for quite some time with regards to explaining how and why Dracula is able to travel through time and why both old and new enemy creatures in his castle are even attacking him to begin with. Even the game's ending was surprisingly simple and straightforward, providing very little of a resolution to Dracula's cursed existence. To summarise, the story for Lords of Shadow 2 had its moments, but I felt it was largely a missed opportunity and think they could have done so much more with it. Fortunately, most of the other gameplay elements in Lords of Shadow 2 fare better than its story.The combat has actually improved a bit compared to the previous games. Dracula's main weapon is the Shadow Whip, which works pretty much the same as the Combat Crosses and other whip-like weapons in the earlier games, allowing Dracula to attack enemies with strong direct attacks or area attacks that hit multiple surrounding enemies. His two other weapons are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. Much like the use of Light and Shadow Magic in the previous games, these weapons run on magic meters and therefore can't be used indefinitely, making them more tactical abilities. The Void Sword drains health from enemies it strikes and transfers it to Dracula, and it can unleash ice attacks that freeze enemies in their tracks. The Chaos Claws can be used to burn through enemy shields and armor, and they're the strongest weapons in the game, although they also require you to get really up close and personal with enemies. Mastering the many different combos and abilities of all three weapons by using them repeatedly upgrades the weapons' strengths. The Void Sword and Chaos Claws are also needed in order to advance by using them to do such things like freezing waterfalls so they can be climbed and burning through chains to cause the platforms they're holding to drop down. Dracula has some secondary weapons/abilities to aid him further in his quest: Shadow Daggers to attack enemies from a distance, a Bat Swarm to disorient and distract enemies, and a Mist Form that allows him to phase through gates and avoid enemy attacks (these abilities can be combined with the Void Sword and Chaos Claws to unleash newer abilities and attacks). A large collection of special item relics add temporary buffs and abilities to Dracula: one temporarily increases his health limit and restores whatever health he may have previously lost, another unlocks all combos/attacks for his weapons for a limited time, and his most powerful relic allows him to transform into a dragon and obliterate all surrounding enemies. His last ability, the Demonic Wings, let Dracula double jump and are necessary to advance through the last quarter of the game, as well as in acquiring the majority of the game's collectibles.Dracula, being a vampire and all, can even grab weakened enemies and drain their blood to regenerate some health before ripping them apart. His standard physical abilities have also improved compared to when he was in his human form as Gabriel Belmont. He can jump from high ledges and land without suffering damage, he can climb along grapple points much more quickly and fluidly, he has a quicker dodge move, and he can sustain more damage than ever before. The previously mentioned collectibles largely consist of gems that increase Dracula's health and magic, and others unlock challenges that can be accessed in the Chupacabras' shop (where experience points can be used to purchase more gems and art work). The challenges consist of Dracula killing enemies while completing other tasks like not using his Void or Chaos powers, or killing a certain number of enemies in a set amount of time. Many of the collectibles require you having to revisit previous locations in order to get to them with the appropriate upgrades (mainly Mist Form and Demonic Wings), but the actual backtracking can be a bit of a challenge itself. Dracula's castle and the city are both very large areas made up of different wings/districts and it's easy to lose one's way. Dracula can use Map Rooms located in different areas of the castle and city to teleport to other Map Rooms and make backtracking less time consuming. Fortunately, aside from increasing Dracula's health and magic, the collectibles are all optional and finding them all doesn't unlock anything like secret cutscenes or bosses.The enemies Dracula faces provide consistent challenges, but largely because they are rather unbalanced. A number of enemies, even the weaker ones, are able to block many of Dracula's attacks; they also tend to spam unblockable charge attacks, which can be incredibly annoying. Due to this combination of many enemies always blocking and using unblockable attacks, as well as constantly swarming you, makes it rather difficult to pull off some of the more complicated and powerful attacks with the Void Sword and Chaos Claws. It's not impossible, but it does take a lot of work to find the right opening to use some specialized attacks. At times it feels like the game is pushing you to rely solely on using counterattacks to damage enemies. The different enemy types are less numerous compared to the ones in previous games, but that doesn't make them any less challenging. The returning monster enemies include skeletons, harpies, and vampires, and the rest are demons of the small, medium, and large variety. There are even soldiers in mechanical exoskeletons and mechs that can be irritating to fight in large numbers, and of course there are Dracula's previous allies, the soldiers, clerics, and paladins of the Brotherhood of Light. The bosses are the high points of the enemy encounters, with many of them providing tough but fair challenges. The final boss is also appropriately challenging, but far from impossible. Quick-time events make a return and are just as well executed as before.Replacing the puzzles from the previous games are the highly controversial stealth segments. In most cases, Dracula has to avoid being spotted by enemies and go into shadowy spots so he can transform into a rat, which in turn allows him to go through air vents and other small openings so he can reach normally inaccessible areas. He can also sneak up behind unaware enemies and possess them so he can unlock certain doors. I personally didn't hate these stealth segments and some of them took some time to figure out. HOWEVER...one specific stealth segment was incredibly frustrating. It involves Dracula sneaking through a garden maze and trying to reach the other end without being spotted by its guardian. If Dracula gets caught, the guardian will pierce him with his spear and instantly transport him to the beginning of the garden maze. Furthermore, stepping on any leaves, which are almost completely covering the floor, will give away Dracula's position and the guardian will be on him in seconds. I and many other gamers could have done without this horribly designed stealth segment, so those who haven't experienced it yet should prepare themselves. One general criticism about the stealth segments involves those cyborg enemies that Dracula always has to sneak past: I felt that Dracula should have been able to fight them directly at some point instead of having to always avoid them even towards the end of the game when he has become more powerful, it would have just made more sense.The DLC for Lords of Shadow 2, Revelations, lets you take the role of Alucard and experience what he was doing behind the scenes before Dracula awoke from his deep slumber. The entirety of Revelations, except the very ending, takes place in Dracula's castle in the past where Alucard must acquire and safeguard Dracula's Void and Chaos powers so his father can reach them himself in due time. Alucard explores new areas of the castle and fights pretty much the same Brotherhood soldiers, vampires, harpies, skeletons, and jailers that Dracula faces in the main game, with a couple of newer varations thrown in there. The final boss is the only truly new enemy, and not only is he appropriately challenging, he also shines some new light on Alucard's eventual role in the main game. Alucard has his own collection of weaponry and powers to deal with his enemies and advance through the castle. His sword, the Crissaegrim, is his main form of offense and has a decent array of combos and abilities for Alucard to utilize against his enemies. The Crissaegrim is forged from the shards of the ice sword Glaciem and the fire sword Igneas, granting it similar magic-based abilities as Dracula's Void Sword and Chaos Claws, namely draining health from enemies and freezing them (Glaciem) and burning through their defenses for greater damage (Igneas). Alucard's secondary abilities are crucial to advancing through the castle and solving the rather challenging puzzles that make a return from the previous games (no stealth segments this time for those of you who detested them in the main game). His abilities are the Bat Cloud, which lets Alucard transform himself into a cluster of bats and dash to distant grapple points in a flash; Timeless Vision, which lets Alucard temporarily rebuild specific ruined portions of the castle in order to reach new areas; and the ability for Alucard's spirit to leave his physical body in the form of a Spectral Wolf that can phase through gates and hazards, as well as jump greater distances to get to out of reach areas. Alucard can also make use of the same item relics as Dracula in the main game, except for the Talisman of the Dragon. Collectibles that increase Alucard's health and magic litter the castle and can be reached at the player's convenience, though some are tricky to find. Revelations was a pretty good DLC, if a bit on the short side.When all is said and done, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is not a bad game, but it's not a great game either, and it's definitely lacking compared to the first Lords of Shadow and especially Mirror of Fate (the best game in the series, in my opinion). While I still find the game to be good enough to earn 4 stars, it's on the lower end of the 4 star spectrum. If I were to grade this game on a 10 point scale, it would get a 7 or a 7.5. Some gamers might be kept busy by the unlockable challenges even after completing the main game, though I personally found many of the challenges to be too frustrating to bother with. Fans of the previous Lords of Shadow games might want to wait for the price to drop to the $30 range before getting this game, and the same pretty much goes for fans of adventure games or the hack and slash genre. Again, this is a pretty good game, it just doesn't excel at anything it does and isn't worth a full price purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2014"}

Because it sucks.First of all, it kept asking me to upgrade the software, yet the upgrade download never worked.  At first I didn't know how to get around that annoying upgrade screen, but finally I hit \"cancel\" and it took me past that screen to the game itself.But then, it required game data to be copied to the hard drive.  It was just a few MB (viewable through the XMB) but it took 20 minutes!  The first 98% was finished after 6 minutes (still slow) but the last 2% took what seemed forever, with me holding my DualShock and waiting patiently...Finally I got to play the game.  I was disappointed that the control configurations could not be customized.  Also, the cars could not be customized.  Also, the tracks could not be customized.  Also, the \"you\" could not be customized.  (The game claims it adjusts gameplay difficulty automatically depending on the player drives, but I was never sure that worked.)The racing sim itself is neither hardcore like GT nor arcade like Burnout.  A convoluted point and badget system determines your rating and the money you earn towards better cars.  The racing felt completely last-gen, with flat graphics and very boring scenery, unlike the first few NFS games that came out on the PS or PS2 which were great for their times.  This game feels cheap, period.  The control felt all the same no matter what car I drove -- at least the differences were minimal.  Background SFX and music were low-grade, too.After a dozen races I decided I could take no more.  Seems EA is trying to revive the NFS as a cash cow to make some quick bucks.  This game stinks.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

COD4 was great and all, but KZ2 has that certain something that puts it a tad above all the rest.  Graphics are the best ever on a console (and hold up nicely against a lot of PC games), campaign is intriguing, and the multiplayer is every bit as fun as Resistance 2 and COD4.  It's probably even more fun.I have to nit pick.  In the original Killzone, one of the characters is Jan (pronounced Yawn) Templar.  In KZ2 they pronounce his name Jan (as in Jan from the Brady Bunch).  This is wrong!  Rico is even more annoying than he was in the original Killzone.  They should have brought Haka back.  These are all small complaints though.  KZ2 is probably the most compelling reason to get a PS3, especially if you're not into blu-ray.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000FQBWAG","reviewerName":"C. L. Hanson","summary":"Classic Nintendo fun!!!","reviewText":"Nintendo wants you to forget about the GameCube. It was all a bad dream (except, in my opinion, Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker). While Sony and Microsoft slug it out over who has the best graphics and functuality (and in the process, paint themselves into a corner), Nintendo is doing what we have waited years for: Make video games fun again.Excite Truck for the Wii is a very fun game, and reminds me of WaveRace64 for the N64. Graphically, it's nowhere near as crisp and grand as anything you'd see on the 360 or the Ps3. Nowhere near. But, this is what Sony and Microsoft want you to believe video games are supposed to be. That's funny, I thought video games were supposed to be fun? That's what Excite Truck is. This is what you seek by playing video games in the first place. If you want realism, go outdoors and experience life.The Wii remote is your steering wheel, and you'll be so caught up in the game, you'll forget how to steer. Not to mention the pure speed captured on screen. You don't have TIME to concentrate! As an old-school gamer, I am so used to controlling with the D-pad, that I instinctively try to steer the truck using that, instead of moving my wrists to steer. That's not a bad thing, it just shows how fun it is. Give me a game like this to forget my problems, 2 hours passed by as if it were a minute.Is the game flawless? No. The only flawless game I've played is Super Mario 64 or the original Legend of Zelda for the NES. I give this a fun factor of 5, with an overall score of 4.This is the first game I've purchased for the Wii (which came with the fantastic Wii Sports), and by all indications, Nintendo has righted themselves and are about to strike gold again. To anyone who doesn't want to own a Wii over the controller, you are really missing out.In the young life of the Wii thus far, Excite Truck is a game you'll want to own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2006"}

Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield.","reviewerName":"Chris Longhurst","summary":"Technically brilliant at the expense of being almost unplayable when you start multiplayer","reviewText":"So there are plenty of reviews of BF4 out there that go on and on about how it's the best game ever etc etc. You don't need to hear that again. It is technically a brilliant game - the sound and graphics from the Xbox One version are really pretty amazing. It still suffers detail popup like most modern games (where stuff just blinks into existence in front of you) but it's a lot less with this than with some other franchises. It is very much a public beta though - there's so many little bugs and problems here and there that it doesn't feel anything like a finished product. Connection problems, bugs that crash you out to the home screen (good luck trying to get two people in a party into the same vehicle), party chat issues, sound that never initialises properly (you can drive a good 30 seconds in the beginning of most games before the sound catches up), elastic physics (other player characters with a boot stuck in a tree while their head is stuck to the ground).The real crux of the issue with this game is the multiplayer mode. The BF series have never been good at single-player mode, relying almost entirely on the multiplayer game as their selling point. With BF4, the learning curve for the multiplayer modes is almost unfathomably steep - to the point where you'll get a couple of days in and be on the verge of making a decision whether to press on or simply sell the game on the used market.So why is this? Simple : you start out the multiplayer mode with an extremely crippled gun. BF4 is a run and gun game and the gun is central to that. The gun you're issued up front is so inaccurate that you'll be lucky to come out of the first few games with any kills at all. The stock iron sight on this thing is so ridiculously large that it obscures most of your view when you try to use it.Let me put this into perspective. I'm by no means the best gamer in the world. In hardcore games (friendly fire, more accurate damage, no map), I can typically end the game with about 12 or 14 kills to something like 8 or 9 deaths. This puts me right in the middle ground of players. I'm never the worst player in the team, but I'm never the top. I've been playing BF, Medal of Honor and Call Of Duty games pretty much since the beginning - so it's not like I've never picked one of these things up.With BF4, I spent the entire first day with zero kills and 15 to 20 deaths per game, putting me dead last in every game. By the end of the first weekend, things hadn't improved much - sitting at something like 3 kills to 15 deaths.So what the heck is going on here? The problem is the progression of weapons. The opening weapon is an AK12C which is as accurate as throwing a fistful of bananas at the enemy. But you need to get kills with it before you can upgrade it or swap it for another weapon. Inaccurate means hard to use, meaning you'll die the instant anyone else in the game sees you because they somehow have more accurate weapons than you do. Coupled with the ongoing server lag issues and the errant hit detection, it's entirely possible you could go days before actually killing anyone.There's a secret sub-game that needs to be played before you can figure out this wholesale slaughter of your online self. The sub-game is trolling the internet looking for the guys who play the game 24/7, the guys who disassemble the code - trying to find what the best combination of weapon and attachment is. THAT is what everyone else already has which is why they can hit you with a single round without even looking while you can unload several clips worth of hit markers into them without them even flinching.Upgrading your weapon is not as simple as it seems. You'd think that equipping a muzzle brake would help - and it does - it reduces the vertical recoil of any weapon by a considerable amount. Problem is that it INCREASES the variability of the horizontal accuracy. So you can have your target reticle right on someone, pull the trigger and nothing happens. Unfair? Yes. Rectifiable? Yes, but only if you have the patience.Ultimately, you need to persevere until you can get the following three attachments for your weapon of choice - the muzzle brake (reduces vertical recoil), a stubby grip or potato grip (restores the horizontal accuracy taken away by the muzzle brake), and a red dot sight (2x zoom maximum - preferably no zoom). Then and ONLY then will you have any semblance of accuracy. Until that point comes, you're just going to have to live with terrible K/D ratios.I'm not sure why they set the barrier to entry so high for this game. Making it this frustrating to get into, even for experienced players, seems clumsy and unnecessary. You WILL get to the point in the first day of two where you'll sit in front of the game and think to yourself &#34;this isn't fun&#34;. At that point you need to decide whether to keep punishing yourself, or to just trade the game for something else.I would say &#34;stick with it&#34; but compared to previous versions of the game, and competing franchises from Call Of Duty, BF4 is punishingly hard to get into. &#34;Sticking with it&#34; might be more effort than it's worth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2014"}

This means if you loved AW1 you'll be thrilled - and if you weren't fond of AW1, you probably won't change your mind here.To start with, the overall graphics are really quite nice here. The level of detail on individual characters is quite impressive, with the guns, radio, ammo, sunglasses etc. that they carry.  A HUD video will pop up with news transmissions or personal broadcasts. The mini-map is in three dimensions to help you with urban assault. Pieces of paper blow down the street. Heat waves and dust storms impair your vision.  You really get the sense that this world you move through is barren, dusty, hot and ominous.The sound fits in very well with this real-world atmosphere. When you're roaming the streets of Mexico, the locals are calling out Spanish dialogue. Bullet shots zing past your head, and the voice acting, while not stellar, is not wooden either.You're not alone on your missions. You have up to three teammates with you. You can choose from a limited selection of individuals and can make some basic choices - medic, rifleman, antitank gunner. It matches your team up with your personal style of gameplay. I also like that they have some female players in here, and that they aren't the traditional \"hide in the back nurses\" games that some games offer!Firing seems a bit slow - when you hit the trigger, it seems like there's a delay before the shot is made. So your own personal actions can get a bit frustrating. On the other hand, team control is well done. You can have your team taking cover alongside you, helping you to wipe out the enemy in well coordinated movement.You can't go Rambo here and expect to survive. Full out running frontal assaults typically spell doom. Instead, you need to survey your surroundings, creep up slowly, peer around the rock and headshot your enemy before he spots you.We're generally not fans of \"make your squad do things\" games - we tend to enjoy games like Splinter Cell where you are directly in control of all actions. But we were very pleasantly surprised with how smoothly and easily this game let you work with your team. The levels that involved alternate styles of gameplay - like riding in a chopper and shooting down enemies as you passed by - were a nice variation as well.There are a few issues that you just have to accept - for example, in the chopper level - surely someone down there had a rocket launcher and could have shot you down pretty quickly! If the situation was reversed, and you were guarding a convoy under assault from a group of helicopters - you would easily have taken them down.Still, that's how a game works, and in general we really enjoyed this one. It was fun to play - and fun for others to watch, which is a good indication of how well paced, voiced and \"drawn\" a game is. It was like watching an interesting war movie, and you got swept up in the events as they rolled out.Recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2007"}

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters. Together with up to three friends players must battle those transformed beings, and in the process improve their angelic skills and regain the heavenly fruit in order to gain their heavenly reward.CustomizationPlayers can create their own heroes, deciding how they would like their face, hair and clothing to look. As the story unfolds, players become stronger, smarter and more powerful, and can create custom companions to join their group as well. Players will also have fun discovering more than 900 pieces of clothing, armor, weapons and other items that will provide them with a unique appearance and special abilities. Even occupations can be customized and changed at any time. Players can take on one of a dozen different jobs with varying strengths, weaknesses, spells and skills.BattleFast-paced turn-based battles unfold as players decide what to do and then view cinematic action scenes. This format rewards careful thinking and strategy over quick reflexes. The more foes players defeat, the stronger their characters become. In the lead up to conflicts, talking with different characters will unfold the story and point players toward their next mission. All quests come with a reward, which might be anything from a rare item to a new, unlocked occupation.Tag ModeDragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skiesincludes the interactive Tag Mode that allows players to keep the game active even while their Nintendo DS system is stored in their pocket, purse or backpack.

Players can even leave the game active in their backpacks, pockets or purses and still interact with other players via an interactive Tag Mode. In addition, information about players' characters can be wirelessly transmitted to others. Also the game contains treasure maps that allow players to find otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemies. In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another. Finally, players with wireless broadband Internet access can visit an online shop to find new items or download additional quests. The selection of items changes daily. Some downloadable quests will continue the main storyline of the game, while others offer standalone missions or quests themed to a particular time of year.Key Game FeaturesHandheld action RPG action where players engage in epic quests in undiscovered lands filled with dangerous monsters and untold storiesConnect locally with up to three friends in cooperative gameplay modesCustomization allowing you to create your own hero, either male or female, changing your hair, face, body style and equipping them from a selection of over 1,000 in-game items including weapons, shields, armor and accessoriesWireless features that allow access to changing exclusive items and questsIn-game treasure maps that reveal otherwise inaccessible special dungeons called grottoes, which can contain rare items or enemiesGameplay with differing stories and missions depending on NPCs encountered","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Very Strong Title for DS, But Not Truly Classic DQ Style","reviewText":"I admit that I am a classic RPG junkie. I grew up playing the old school classics, Dragon Warrior, Ultima, and Final Fantasy were some of my first RPGs.  I play Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest 1, 2, and 3 on my cell phone and have over a dozen classic RPG titles on the DS.  I love the games even though I hate using the DS (made for children's' hands).  So I was actually excited when DQ 9 was announced for DS.  I thought \"about time they go back to the old school setup!\"Only they didn't!First, this is a great game with all the classic DQ elements including the ability to hire your party and adjust classes ALA DQ 3!  Bravo!  Second, the graphics are top quality for the DS and do not disappoint while keeping the classic Toriyama art intact.Here is my rant and rave section:  First, the multiplayer setup is a joke.  The DS is not a proper multiplayer system and I hate to see wasted content.  I like the idea of a multiplayer DQ, but it needs to be ironed out. It would have made more sense on PS3 (with it's better online capabilities).  Second, the battles are fun, yet the characters all run around and do crazy things that drag the fights on.  I prefer the old setup where everyone stands in a line and jumps and slashes.  Very old school.  Very quick.Also, why can't I speed up the text?  I hate waiting for the lines to appear.  For fast readers like me it's excruciating.Another beef that I have is the random battle element is taken out.  I admit that at times I like the new battle setup, but I wish they would have stuck to the old setup.  Also, the world map is a weird cross between the old Dragon Quest overworld map style (ala DQ4) and the 3rd person perspective of DQ8.  I would have liked to be able to zoom a little higher, it seems that when walking around I look at the mini map and not the actual screen (like Ff10!!! lol)So despite these small flaws, the game is brilliant.  Dragon Quest 8 was truly the pinnacle of the Dragon Quest series, but Dragon Quest 9 won't disappoint true fans while adding a little extra for the new players.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2010"}

The cutscenes and dialog are truly painful, and w/out a way to skip past them, you must suffer or go make a sandwich. The controls are generally fine, but it feels like you are going thru the motions and just killing time; I didn't find anything technically wrong here, but it just seemed to have whatever \"IT\" is that makes a game an invigorating experience, and most of all fun. I would say personally this is one of Ubisoft's worst games. Not a bad rent if you want to check it out, though. I guess the biggest thing to me is that this game had some real potential, esp. they had put the time into it like the Rainbow Six games. But as it stands, I would rather play BLACK again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2008"}

The online setup really dosen't have much going for it, but it is better than Nintendo's off-line support.The game selection couldn't be better. Biggest selection of the consoles, mostly first party games, with a dash of multi-platform games. It's probably most know for giving a home to the arcade-famous dance-dance pad, or for the Grand Theft Auto series. Most of the games are teen ratings or mature ratings, so infants beware!I thourghly think you will enjoy this system.

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Outstanding","reviewText":"Both the xbox and the kinect get my highest rating.I have an original first gen Xbox 360 I got when they first came out, that's still kicking.  That was in my bedroom to extend my media center PC there.I had a newer Elite hooked up with my PS3, wii, and mac mini that runs windows 7 media center, all going to my TV in the great room.  So this new slim Xbox replaced that bulkier Elite, that Elite went to my bedroom, and my 7 year old is thrilled since now I'm buying a TV for his room to hook up the old first gen white one.So the Xbox - love the redesign, but the packaging really ticked me off.  rather than just some static cling type protective film over the disc tray, they used something with annoying tacky junk on it. And of course it did NOT come off nice.  So I spent about 30 minutes getting it all off without messing up the finish.  Usually you can use some part of that protective cover that still has some tackiness to it to \"blot up\" what remained behind, but this stuff was just a nightmare to remove.Also can't believe in the era of HD TV's they still give the lowest possible version of the cable to hook up to a TV.  I mean come ON, how many people are still using nothing more than one video cable and a L/R sound input on an old non HDTV?  I get that they want to make money, but after ponying up $400, at LEAST give a usable cable...  Fortunately for me I was replacing an existing one so just used the HDMI cable already in place.  But this leaves me with nothing to use for my son's room when I get his new TV, so another cable purchase needed.Sound - this new slim xbox is dead silent.  No more turbofan engine sounds when you fire it up.  I'm about 18 or 20 feet away from where my TV and all these other boxes sit and I can't hear it when it's running.  It's just as silent as the PS3 if not more.  Great job after the years of jet wash sounds the previous versions created.Brick *is* smaller but hardly by much...  Uses the same plug to the AC source, but it's a different plug coming into the unit now.  So you can swap the brick but don't have to swap the AC cable coming to it if you're replacing an existing one like I did.I had no problem using one of the several hard drive transfer cables I have laying around the house from the days when they used to ship them free to people on request.  Transfer went fine, didn't even need to use the CD, was built into the xbox OS evidently now to recognize the cable and just do the transfer.  Everything went except the actual files of the games I installed from the discs to help speed up load times.  Then I hit the [...] site to move licenses to the new box, and all is working nice and easy.Pretty AND quiet, could not ask for more.Then there's the Kinect unit.  One USB plug on the built-in cable, and you're off.I was amazed at how well it worked, I had lower expectations for a first gen piece of equipment like this.  But it DOES work, and surprisingly well.  It's fun to use, and me and my 7 year old enjoyed playing with the bundled game.  Slight delay between your actions and it's representation on the screen, but it IS just slight, much less than I had expected.  I wish selecting things was a \"hold your hand so you're 'covering' the button, then PUSH towards the TV to push the button\" but it's a 'hold your hand so you cover the button then hold the hand still for 3 or 4 seconds to select it\" type of action.  I also wish I could skip the intro to the kinect game that always warns you to move furniture out of the way and such.

It is up to Crash and his sister, Coco, to conquer this threatening threesome and grab the goodies.Warpedoffers 25 levels of challenging solo action.

Hardcore gamers will appreciate its hidden secrets and shortcuts.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Hand in Hand with Metroid Fusion","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Classic 2D platformer Metroid; crips controls and gameplay; sweet graphics and awesome remixed music; challengingTHE BAD: Non-priority storyline; too many power-ups without equal payoff; almost equivelant to Metroid Fusion; shortDIFFICULTY: MediumZero Mission is basically a re-telling, or re-imagining of the original Metroid that came out for the NES back in the late 80's. Now, don't go expecting the EXACT same level design with simply gussied up graphics. While some areas look familiar, there is a lot of new stuff in this one, a more reasonable challenge, more responsive controls, and greatly improved graphics and sound. Additionally, the vertical portions that were notorious for their length in the original Metroid are now reasonably smaller, mostly because the platforms are way bigger as well as is Samus Aran.While Metroid Fusion was a lot more of a story-driven game, this one has a basic storyline the same as the original Metroid - go off and investigate an alien race brewing no good in some far off planet of Zebes. This gives way to further exploration, thankfully unlike the more force-ahead storyline of Fusion, which left much less time to go and explore areas that were not yet attainable. The fundementals still lie within: start off weak, explore the areas, gain new abilities to open up new paths, and also be given both a map AND icons for which to follow throughout the game, this way you always know where to go next. Sure as hell beats the no-map-for-you approach of the original, near impossible to defeat, Metroid. Now, while fans of Fusion definitely will notice a small step behind graphically, as more pixels are present and backgrounds aren't as polished, they'll most definitely appreciate the gameplay, which remains just as iron tight as all 2D Metroids. The music is a remixed bunch from the original NES Metroid, and quite nostalgic and enjoyable to listen to (albeit more repetitive). So because of all this new stuff, the game is A LOT easier to go through and beat than the original NES version... not to mention shorter, on first try, it took me just under 4 hours to beat the game.So, what does this game in fact give to you that Fusion didn't? Not much. If you've played Fusion, you've played this game. And if you've played the original NES version to death, don't bother with this one. The cut-scenes aren't as pretty or dramatic, and Samus herself lacks personality as a result. BUT if you're thinking of buying the \"classic NES series\" of Metroid for the GBA, don't bother, just get this one. With its new lower price and unlockable original Metroid within, there's no point in getting a different copy for a few dollars less. Still, once you beat this game though, playing through the original Metroid will be so unappealing you probably won't make it past the first room.One final complaint to make about Zero Mission is the power-ups. Now, while it's great that Samus eventually gets all her powers back, it's annoying that once they're all back, you don't really get to exploit them as much as you'd like to. There just aren't all that many enemies at a time to kill or tough obstacles to overcome.My complaints are pretty minor though, and I have to admit to having a lot more fun at some points playing this game that I did with Fusion. There's simply a bigger sense of freedom with this one because of the non-prioritized storyline.BOTTOM LINE: If you've played through Fusion or the classic NES Metroid, this is a waste. If you haven't and would love some good, challenging Metroid, buy this. It's not long, but handhelds aren't really meant to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Mizov","summary":"A Whole Lot of Crazy","reviewText":"The best way to describe the Saint's Row series is if the developer's took a look at GTA: San Andreas and said \"okay, that's great, but let's try for 40% more wacky\" - and each iteration thereafter was just that much more absurd than the last. This is a good thing. GTAIV went the more serious route with a deep, compelling crime drama and a protagonist battling his inner demons... Saint's Row had you go into ragdoll mode to commit insurance fraud. It's a nice duality for this console generation.Anyway, enough history as I'm sure since you're onto the third edition that you have some idea what the game is about. If you enjoyed Saint's Row 2, you're going to enjoy this game. There are some really, really weird new weapons (anything having to do with Professor Genki really), a new city to wander around, a lot more character customization, and just a lot of silly crap.The actual gameplay itself is an upgrade to Saint's Row 2. Everything feels pretty tight, the vehicles and targeting systems are good, no complaints there really. The city itself looks great, it's big with a lot of varying areas and a lot of mayhem to be had, that's for sure. The soundtrack is a little over the top, it kind of makes me feel like I'm in an 80's action montage half the time... which is a good thing.A big standout to me is the new upgrade system. You're able to accumulate an empire as you snag properties and can use the cash to buy health upgrades, weapon upgrades, clothes, etc. The initial character model creation has a ton of variation as well. Definitely a good move on the developer's part there.The story itself is pretty good. It's not longer a three part thing where you go after each gang individually, it's more of a cohesive thing that goes throughout the game. If you feel like ignoring it, of course, go nuts. That's what sandbox games are all about!I have two gripes though: the character models aren't as crisp as they could be. For the amount of customization available they could have made them look a little better. They're not bad... just not great either. In addition, they took out a few of the more interesting side missions from the last game (Fuzz and the Sanitation Truck one stand out to me) and kept the more mundane ones (Escort. Always with the pimps & hoes).Regardless, the game is a lot of crazy. It's fun to screw around with for ten minutes or a few hours. If you're a fan of the series, definitely worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002C0VNQQ","reviewerName":"John Salerno","summary":"An excellent, involving game","reviewText":"I just finished Risen and knew I had to write a review about it. I didn't quite expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. I was absorbed pretty much from the beginning. The story itself is interesting, though not necessarily what will keep you playing. The strongest aspects of the game are the various characters, relationships, factions, etc. that add an extra layer of depth to the game. It's a pretty large game that definitely requires an investment of time and effort to play, but if you're an RPG player, it's worth it.Probably my biggest complaint is that it is the type of game that requires (or at least is greatly aided by) some external research before beginning. It helps a great deal to know in advance which faction you want to join, how you will spend Learning Points, and which quests to do first so you don't block them out later. It also helps to know little details like eating 10 apples or 10 eggs gives +1 to strength, but only for a maximum of +5. You will also need to find potion and item recipes at fan websites, because there's really no other way to know how to do these things. In other words, it's the kind of game that you could hurt yourself later on if you don't know in advance how things work and what you want to do with your character. Perhaps it's not as big of a deal as I may think it is (in other words, I'm sure the game is still perfectly playable, if not necessarily as easy), but I think most people will enjoy knowing ahead of time what needs to be done in certain situations. Just check out fan sites or the official forums for some of this information.I never had any technical problems, just one bugged quest where an NPC didn't show up where he needed to be. But after reloading a few times, it worked properly. Some people complain about the game being too dark (mainly on the Xbox), but I will say that at night it does get rather dark. But it was the same in Gothic 2, so I don't think it's a problem specific to this game.Overall, I'd give the game 4.5 stars for its depth and for the way it completely sucked me into its story and world. Highly recommended for RPG players, especially (but not limited to) the hardcore type.Edit: Installed and ran perfectly on Windows 7 64-bit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

I've always been slow to catch on to analog, regardless of what game I'm playing. But once I got used to them, I was an old pro and Lara was moving around without problem. As far as graphics are concerned, I'm not a big stickler for that kind of thing. I like adventure/RPG games. I like the story, which I thought was creative and interesting.Having never played previous TR games (which I hope to change), I don't know exactly how the story differs, except that it seems, judging by other reviews, that Lara spends more time in the real world instead of spending her entire adventure in a bunch of caves. My opinion is this: How many mummies, scorpions and other jungle creatures can she kill before it gets old? I thought the variation of settings just in this game alone was very cool. It had caves, labs, an insane asylum, cities, churches, sewers, etc. Lots of games that I've played can't boast that kind of diversity in setting.Overall, I thought this was a fun game to play, and if you're not afraid of change, go ahead and buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2005"}

You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great graphics, plus it's FREE once you buy the game!","reviewText":"Guild Wars is a cool online MMORPG that you don't have to pay a monthly fee for!

{"product_name":"B000U34SZA","description":"","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"Now that were at a Real Party, How about some snacks?  (by Laura)","reviewText":"Introduction:Mario Party DS is quite a hoot!  This isn't the first time I've participated in the Mario Party series as I've also played Mario Party 7 (another game you should check out) for the Nintendo Gamecube.  I shall disclose to you the plot, as well as the good and the bad points of this newest fiesta.Plot:It's raining sky crystals, and one falls near Mario.  The next day, Mario tells all of his friends about it.  During this gathering, Kamek brings an interesting note from Bowser.  Apparently, Bowser wants to apologize for being a jerk, and throw a big feast for the crew.  Who could resist?  In other words, the characters aren't that bright (I mean, come on!  Would you really go to a villain's house for dinner?  Bowser has kidnapped Peach herself at least a dozen times!), and they accept the invitation.  The invitation was an elaborate trap, as a big cage falls over the crew, as they arrive.  Using his sceptor, Bowser shrinks the crew into \"Mini\" heroes, takes the sky crystal they have, and wisks them away.  Now, everyone wants to be the hero, and this is where you come in: play as Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, or Toad, and travel through a garden, a piano room, a jungle, a library, and Bowser's own lair.  Your goals are to outshine the other heroes, collect all of the sky crystals, and defeat Bowser once and for all.  Good luck!Bad Points:1.  Not enough girl characters.  Out of all eight characters, only two are female.  While this topic is on the table, there aren't as many characters (male or female) to choose from as Mario Party 7.2.  Some mini games require luck.  I don't like this.3.  Some mini games just stink, and others require you to work with a COM or two (if you're playing solo).  While these minigames can be fun, If your luck is bad, and your partner/partners stink, you may be in trouble.  That's just not fair.4.  There are certain spaces on the game boards where you get five coins while someone else gets five coins.  You get to choose who you want to be your friend.  When I'm playing and someone else lands on such a space, I'm never their friend...  Besides, giving coins to a COM opponent is just stupid.Good Points:1.  Most of the minigames are fun and addictive.2.  Most of the minigames are hillarious!  They really took advantage of the fact you're tiny.  Rubber Ducky Rodeo anyone?3.  The boards are fun, with various traps and rules to keep you from being bored.4.  Some of the bosses may be challenging, but not to the point of frustration.  They're relatively simple once you get the hang of it, and they're quite a bit of fun themselves.5.  Unlike Mario Party 7, you don't have to buy your rewards with milage points.  All you do is get a certain number of points to get rewarded with something.  This saves time, and helps keep away repetition.6.  The boss trophies are comical.7.  The mini games take great advantage of the stylus and the mike.Conclusion:That's all I can say.  Overall, this is a very staightforward game that's great for dull moments.  It should be noted that you don't have to save, but the game saves automatically, every time you complete a minigame (this is true in story mode as well).  So when you want to quit, just play the mini game (that always occurs) at the end of the turn, wait until the end of it, and when you see the board again turn it off.  Or, if the current turn isn't going well, just turn the DS off and you'll start that one turn over again (providing you've played at least one turn and minigame by this point).  If you like this game, look into Mario Party 7.  Have fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2008"}

I don't usually find myself agreeing with either camp when it comes to game reviews but I have to say that this game, while not all that and a bag of chips, is NOT the piece of trash that the nay-sayers want you to think it is.  I don't know what they were thinking they were going to get out of a game honestly.  Note to those crying your eyes out, hype doesn't equal promises.  I felt Halo3 succeeded at being enjoyable and entertaining throughout, the mark of a good game.Now that we have that out of the way, lets get on with the review.  In typical Halo fashion there is an enjoyable and unique story here if you care to actually open your eyes and ears and get immersed in it (or you can fall back on the 'it is just another alien invasion story' if you want to take the lazy way out).  The final installment has you playing the role of the Master Chief as he finishes the battle to try and save the human race from the Covenant forces, who believe firing the Halo rings will take them on their \"great journey\", and the Flood who basically want to eat everyone - Yum, yum.  More is revealed about the forerunners, the Halo technology and the history of why the Forerunners built them and did with them.  Also we get to follow some recurring characters as they fulfill their role in the scheme of things.So, if you are familiar enough with what the game is all about lets cut to the meat of the review - game play.  Halo is nothing revolutionary so there.  If you are the person that has to have cutting edge and fancy gimmicks to enjoy a game you can move right along and I saved you some bucks.  Halo3 plays almost exactly like the original Halo (surprise!) so you won't see any new cover system added, nor new combat moves, combos, etc.  What you get with Halo3 isn't a new gaming experience so much as a completion of the trilogy (again, surprise!).A few things have been added to the game (and the assault rifle is back, thank you very much), a new weapon here and there, an old weapon retooled and a couple new vehicles.  The new vehicles perform much the same way the old ones did and accomplish similar roles so they exist for flavor more than anything else.  In addition to the new weapons you can now detach the stand alone turrets (the human machine gun and the Covenant plasma-gun equivalent) and carry them around if you desire.  Once detached they are affected by some balancing features in the form of limited ammunition and causing the Chief to move slower.  It is a fair trade.  In the form of one-use items they added portable shield walls, bubble shields and a couple other \"devices\".  They aren't essential to game play but they are nice to have on your person.In addition to adding things to the game they also did some tuning.  Despite what some are saying the graphics are great and the scenery is much more lush and detailed.  The world has a more fleshed-out feel to it and it really feels like you are in the world now, instead of just moving through a level.  On the topic of level design there are some really beautiful levels that enjoyed playing through a few times.  The AI has been improved some so that your companions aren't helpless now and they got a crash course in the basics of driving vehicles allowing you to focus on being a passenger or gunner if you desire.  This doesn't work perfectly as you'd expect though as they are not able to read your mind and drive accordingly.  The non-player charachters are also more vocal and physical compared to earlier versions and they react even more to your presence and behavior - but that is still on a limited scale.  The story was touched on above but I have to say again that there really is a storyline here so let yourself go and enjoy being a part of it.As you'd expect (given that the platform is now the 360) the controls have changed just slightly.  The reload is now the upper right bumper and the left bumper cycles grenade types or reloads your dual-wield weapon.  Halo3 still incorporates a great dual-wield system where both weapons are controlled independently (except for aiming of course) allowing you to choose how you want to use them in combat, instead of having both blaze away when you pull the primary fire trigger.Multiplayer also is little changed except for the inclusion of two things:  Save Films and the Forge.  Save Films is just what the name says, a video file you can go back and replay in any angle/zoom/speed you want.  Fun.  The Forge allows you to customize multiplayer maps in case you didn't like the defaults or just want to try a change.  In multiplayer you also have some currency you can spend to drop items into the game (such as vehicles, weapons, items, etc.).In the complaint department I didn't encounter anything.  Sure, I could nitpick but why? At its core Halo3 is fun the way it is.  It is true to the trilogy and I think fans of the original Halo will enjoy the last one.  If you expected something new then I suggest you buy something new and not a repeat title like this.  I do believe the game was pushed too heavily in the pre-release propaganda (all games are) and it seemed that Halo3 would go out with a bang that would set the whole trilogy on its head and that is not the case.  Halo, Halo2 and Halo3 are all basically the same game.  They get prettier, the storyline gets more involved and the weapon types and vehicles fluctuate but when the dust settles they aren't really different.  So if you can handle a game that you've already played before in its previous incarnations then do yourself a favor and finish the trilogy, it is worth it.  If you need your games to be bigger and better with every release then I suggest passing up Halo3 and learn to stop pre-ordering games because the guys behind the counter tell you they are going to be all the rage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Bill Covington \"Chalupacabra\"","summary":"Bring Extra Ammo","reviewText":"Where to begin with this one?  It's a shooter, it's fast paced, and it's intense.  Within this game there are four acts.  They're kind of put together in a Grindhouse like cult film.  You pick your character, and you start shooting.  You can easily make it through the 4 acts on easy in a day.  The real fun comes in playing this game with 3 other friends on the harder difficulties.  You're going to die, a lot, but that's part of the fun.One of the drawbacks I hear a lot is the length.  However, the game has dubbed a new type of AI that changes the way the game plays each time (different enemy spawn points, weapon locations, etc..).  This compensates for the lack of levels.  Also, new DLC should be out which includes more co-op action!The game also has a multiplayer mode which I found rather lame.  You play as either the \"Special Infected (besides your run-of-the-mill zombies, you have four types of super zombies), or the survivors and try to dole out as much damage as possible.  It feels a little rushed, and kind of rudimentary.The only thing I didn't really like are the lack of variety in the weapons, and the graphics.  Neither one makes or breaks the game though in my opinion.So to sum it up, this game is built for multiplayer over LIVE.  If you don't have Xbox LIVE, get LIVE, rent it first, or just avoid it.  If you do have LIVE, and you enjoy FPS then this is a must own for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2009"}

I picked up my dad's old guitar and strummed the rhythm part, but I was always jealous of the lead guitar. Yes, my part was the &#34;foundation&#34; but that guy really rocked. The Navy, a family, a couple of jobs and 20 years later I still remember the way he flew through those rifts.While I'm not saying I am going to be the next Eddie Van Halen, I do feel that Rocksmith 2014 is starting me down the road to (finally) playing lead guitar. Now I can strum away on my old acoustic, but when I feel the need, I can switch to my electric (once gathering dust) and fire up Rocksmith.What Rocksmith does best is adapt to you. It adapts to your skill level. It recognizes your mistakes. It is like having a one-on-one instructor that doesn't judge or wince when you hit a wrong note. Or charge you $100 an hour for lessons.I wish that Rocksmith taught you to read music. I could really use help in that category, but I supposed that I'll have to break out some flash cards and learn it the old fashioned way. My hope is that I will soon be able to join in with some friends that currently get together and play on the weekends.Overall: 4 stars.

There are great games, and then, there are immortal games. Demon's Souls is the latter type of video game. I haven't played a game that's clicked with me like Demon's Souls has since A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo. It is fantastic. It's better than any mere 'flavor of the month' AAA video game you might read about. Those games suck compared to Demon's Souls. Most things do.Basically, you're a warrior that has save the kingdom of Boletaria from demons by lulling the biggest demon of them all, the Old One, back to sleep. To do this, you'll have to slay all of the demons that are feeding him souls. This is accomplished by traveling to various parts of Boletaria through a hub world called \"The Nexus.\" For killing demons, you get Souls, the game's currency. Souls can spent on equipment, spells, or \"Soul Levels\" to make your character stronger. To win, you'll need plenty of those Souls!This game is pure gameplay. Demon's Souls doesn't have to hide its lack of depth behind cutscenes, mostly because it's full of depth. There's an interesting storyline and an elaborately designed world for you to learn more about, but the game doesn't force it on you. If you want to ignore the storyline and just fight monsters, Demon's Souls doesn't care.There's a unique difficulty system in Demon's Souls called \"World Tendency.\" It's related to actions you perform in each level. If you die too often, the World Tendency becomes black and makes enemies stronger. However, if you kill demons, the World Tendency shifts back toward white. Also, different World Tendency states cause different NPCs to appear in each level, so it's actually something you need to manipulate to see all of the content in the game.Because the game is non-linear and has many different character classes to choose from, the replay value is pretty substantial on a new file. However, with New Game Plus, Demon's Souls has even more than that. If you'd like to, you can start up a new game with the same character with which you finished your last game. He or she will be at the same level and have the same items, but all of the enemies in the game will become much stronger. All of sudden tactics that made your last game easy are all that's keeping you alive!Some games don't go into the limelight easily. They maintain popularity for years, sometimes decades, after their initial release. Call me crazy, but I think Demon's Souls will be one of those games. Today's kids will look back on this game with the same fondness that I look back on A Link to the Past with and decide to play it again. And when that happens, tomorrow's kids might decide that they, too, want to become Slayers of Demons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2014"}

The story has evolved into something nonsensical and this third chapter has lost any, if not all of the frights that the first one managed to gather. Does this make F.E.A.R. 3 a bad game? No, in fact it's far from being a bad game. I'd actually say that this is one of the best two-player co-op games you can currently get your hands on and it shouldn't be missed for those who enjoy progressing through a solid campaign experience with a buddy.If you've played the expansion pack for F.E.A.R. 2, then you will be familiar with Point Man, who is one of the two characters you can play as. The other is Paxton Fettel, cannibal psycho psychic dude who has been a series staple from the very beginning. Between the two of you, assuming that you're playing with someone else of course, you will team up to dish out some serious harm to your enemies. So much in fact that you're certain to attain a certain euphoria as you zip through levels decimating your enemies. And decimate them you do. There's something inherently satisfying about psychically suspending some dude in the air while your partner unloads a clip into him at close range, making him jiggle like some marionette. Or you can just make them explode outright in a fine mist of blood and gore. Point Man plays like a standard run and gun super soldier but Paxton adds a certain flair to the proceedings that makes things that much more fun. In the end, the game trades in it's well worn scare tactics for some solid co-op gameplay and it's a worthwhile trade.The game also offers some online multiplayer modes, the best of which in my humble opinion being the \"F***ing Run\" mode that puts you and three others in front of a wall of smoke that kills anyone who can't manage to stay ahead of it. It's incredibly intense and a lot of fun if you can find people online to play along with you.I like this game very much and it offers a significant amount of replay value for your dollar, which is one of the best compliments you can pay a game of this type. I would recommend this to fans of the series looking for a change of pace and to those looking for some good two man gameplay. Look elsewhere for scares or you'll be sorely disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Not in the least disappointed!","reviewText":"Castlevania has covered a lot of ground. It is one of the longest running franchises and every game after CV 1 introduced brand new elements with each iteration. The only negative constant is CV's split personality of fantasy and gothic horror has fared poorly in 3D. While CV 64, Lament of innocence, and Curse of darkness are not complete failures they did suffer from bad controls or repetitive bland level designs.When Igarashi declared 2D will never die he already had hordes of fan boys.  Symphony of the night, Dawn of sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia are arguably the best titles in the franchise.  All of them follow the \"metroid vania\" style with vast exploration, back tracking, hidden items, rpg lite elements, old school side scrolling design, and an attempt to spin a good narrative. It's understandable then why devout followers may outright fear a deviation from this formula. After all, it works splendidly and Igarashi himself has implied CV cannot work in 3D.So, what is Lords of shadow? Aesthetically it has much of the game play of  Super Castlevania 4. Gabriel uses his chained whip cross to not only slay monsters but also to swing across ravines, control mounted beasties, or to shatter obstructions blocking his path. The weapon is as much of an exploration tool as it is a vampire killer. Akin to Simon's Quest there are some missions that take place during day light. If you're not an old grumpy man such as I am it may come as a surprise CV was still \"awesome\" pre-Iga. Dracula's curse, Bloodlines, Super CV4, and Rondo of blood were equally prolific to the action plat former genre.Before you worry let me testify that the character models, voice acting, creature design, and environments are wonderful! Sigh in relief and know that LOS can hold its' own against the heavy hitters Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and God of war. The production values are astounding. The budget size involved was probably equal to the economy of a small country! The sheer scale resembles Peter Jackson's LOTR movies bumping uglies with Del Toro's Pan's labyrinth and Hell Boy.Nay-sayers may critique Lords of shadow for having mostly linear level design or for leaning towards fairy tales more than scary camp fire urban legends. Argumentatively though CV has constantly been straight to the point. Metroid-vanias did set up the gimmick of revisiting previous places but the bosses were always in the same zones and the series of events stayed tight to the script. CV never was Elder Scrolls Oblivion so why expect it to be now? (Because of Patrick Stewart's narration perhaps?) Contrary to what the popular consensus may lead you to assume CV is always a safe harbor for sprites, imps, living dolls, golems, giant spiders, flying spell books, flower dwelling dryads, bone dragon skulls, and witches.  Dracula's Transylvanian country side is as much enchanting as it is menacing. To lay blame on the CV most responsible for such inclusions would place the pointer on Symphony of the night. Thus if you have a bone to pick perhaps you should start with the most prolific foot note in the saga. (Btw Simon's Quest started the spider infestation. If you despise arachnids hang the proper offender!)Eye and audio candy is dandy but the big question is how does it play right? Is this a Kratos crib note rip off? To answer that question I assume all of you have a grasp of gaming history. God of war \"is\" a triple A contender in this arena. Alas, GOW also is not big on originality. Simon Belmont had a chained weapon first. He used it to put the smack down on monsters and to traverse over obstacles in his path. Not surprisingly Gabriel does the same thing. Who inspired who? Perhaps I'll let that pondering rest in a coffin for another night!Honestly yes, LOS's combat seems similar to GOW  when you initially dive into it. The way the chain flails around can be compared to Kratos's own weapon of similar design.  Gabriel has aerial and ground based combos mixing it up with a series of light and heavy attacks. As you complete chapters you get \"experience\" and these points can be spent to buy or upgrade even more battle techniques. LT blocks and if you hold it while pressing directions on the right analog stick the protagonist will gracefully roll out of the way of impending danger. Defending exactly when an enemy strikes can open up a chance for a counter strike.The enemies are for the lack of a gentler term outright vicious! If you prefer simply mashing buttons without taking evasion and strategy into account you will end up dead fast.To add to this grandiose scale of delicious action plat former clich&eacute;s there are quick time events. Luckily LOS is forgiving with them. Simply wait for when the outer circle closes within the inner circle before taping a button and you'll persevere. Nothing I've encountered thus far seems as maddening as the knife fight with Krauser in Resident Evil 4 and I'm quite happy with that.Later on you get access to light & dark magic. \"Light magic\" heals you as you dish out damage to foes and \"Dark magic\" makes you an enraged berserk-er thus your strikes score more critical blows. Floating wisps emerge from slain adversaries and pressing the left analogue stick replenishes light magic by absorbing them whereas  pressing right analogue stick does the same task for dark magic. On par with the warrior upgrades both schools of sorcery have additional spells and improvements that can be purchased.If you read what I typed carefully it becomes transparent LOS is not simply a clone of GOW. Though some comparisons can be made the later inclusion of spells and a bigger emphasis placed on careful tactics belongs in its' own league.LOS has subtle endearing touches too. I noticed snow flakes would actually touch the camera lens and \"The Titan\" battles revolving around scaling behemoths whilst attacking weak points can be compared to Shadow of Colossus or Luke Sky Walker bringing down Imperial walkers with nothing more than a grappling hook and an unstable light saber. The proverbial cherry topping this off is the option to revisit stages to complete trials or to utilize newly acquired skills to open up treasures or routes previously inaccessible. Put simply there is a nod to SOTN in LOS.So why haven't I mentioned the story?  Frankly the plot though delivered fantastically is mediocre. As kids we worshiped SOTN as a literary master piece in game form. It was \"so cool\" Alucard's name was Dracula spelled backwards and the very fact every main character talked in the game left the enraptured audience in stunned bliss! LOS has much in common. Aka LOS's narrative takes itself too seriously and most of you are going to be able to guess the \"shocking conclusion\" less than half way through the game. There are very few encounters with other people. The leading cast for LOS is about as small as that of SOTN.The yarn unravels as follows. Gabriel has lost his wife Marie and desires to bring her back from the dead. There's a prophecy stating he will use the power of shadows as his own to be the savior of mankind. Said \"quest\" predictably holds the key to resurrecting Marie whom is presently a ghost. Zobek, a fellow holy knight agrees to help our beleaguered protagonist as does Claudia, a mute acrobatic telapath heart throb whom is followed around by an intimidating armor golem. Point being? It's mildly amusing but you shouldn't count on multiple layers of depth. CV has always been a glorified HS student's fan fiction about the supernatural struggle of good versus evil within the human heart. Sure, It's not as horrendous as Twilight but it's not as profound as The Green Mile, Shaw shank redemption , The color purple, or Schindler's list either. LOS's symbolism and metaphors are as appealing as they are commonplace. Yet let me be quoted saying there is a sublime endearing quality to keeping it simple. CV is more about the scenic sights, the challenges, and the immersion than it is about overly convoluted side stories and pretentious prattling!When sized up LOS is a robust lengthy game. LOS is also a fun game. A worthy 3D entry of Castlevania is finally here, at least in my humble opinion!Pros1# A visual and orchestral feast.2# Top notch voice acting (Insert snarky Star Trek TNG and Star Gate Universe jokes here! Picard and Rush join forces!)3# Smooth game play4# Challenging5# Awe inspiring environmental design. Nothing is flat and repetitious .6# Combat is deeper than it lets on. There are many diverse tweaks that prevent it from simply being a God of war clone.7# Gamers can revisit old locales with new skills to uncover more rewarding secrets.#8. Lengthy adventure. You're getting your money's worth!#9. Puzzles are well presented and enjoyable. You can even choose to bypass them if you're getting stressed out!#10 Giant spiders, boars, and werewolves can be temporarily ridden!#11 Each level presents objectives in a befitting manner. Whether it's whipping a curtain rope to lift draperies in order to burn vampires with daylight, getting ravens to congregate on a scarecrow to bring it to hellish life, running around in a music box for a mad witch, or having to use your noggin to get past assorted traps the game-play constantly keeps the pace fresh and satisfying.Cons1. Camera is stationary. This equates to awkward plat forming and unnecessary deaths occasionally.2. The plot is predictable. Let's face it, CV games have covered so many weird angles, different approaches, and alternating time eras there are not many stones left to upturn! Still, it bears mentioning Gabriel's tale is magnificent for what it is.3. Unexpected spike in difficulty at certain points (Er, this is subjective. Depending on personal preferences this can be a positive merit as well!)4. The music is admirable but many of the familiar soundtracks from past CV games are not present in LOS. (There are a few remastered tributes but they're so subtle you may not recall them if you haven't played the nes/snes entries in awhile.)For you if: Want an ecstasy inducing 3D action adventure experience? Not a snobbish purist? Have 20 or so hours to burn during a boring vacation? Buy it now!Not for you if: Do action plat formers seem derivative to you? Is Igarashi your only god? Can no other CV ever top your sweet baby SOTN? Is the metroid-vania historical canon mapped out on your wall? Have a grudge against Kojima, David Cox, or Mercury Steam? Prefer a shorter and faster game? Run for the hills!Personal Opinion: LOS delivered on all fronts in my book. This is a rare instance I wasn't disappointed or bored to tears by a 3D castlevania entry.Though it came under scrutiny from reviewers for being a God of war clone LOS is primarily borrowing aspects of Super CV 4, Simon's Quest, Lament of innocence, and Dracula's curse to give it a proper next generation polish. God of war is a splendid game but it sorta borrowed from CV before CV borrowed from it. Regardless if you loved Kratos's journey this is another example of the mythological fantasy/gothic horror action genre done right.Obviously if you are a staunch traditionalist you may not like the changes to canon. As my negative reviewer mark can attest this game is going to draw some controversy and fire from certain lynch mobs.(C'mon peeps! Can't we respect different opinions without marking each other down? Isn't that being a tad childish?) My advice is to judge it as a reboot and simply enjoy what's offered. Even if your sensibilities cannot accept this as a CV entry it's a sodding great game regardless!Despite critiquing the story for being predictable it got much better later on. Certain characters such as Laura the vampire girl proved to have many more layers than I initially expected. There's a heart-warming touching scene played out amongst Gabriel,Marie, and Laura which is presented excellently to say the least.In the days in which some games of this genre try to give us less for our gaming dollar LOS gives us much more than expected. Mercury steam should be commended on a job well done and I'm sincerly hoping they make a worthy sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2010"}

They all require you to use Stealth and be sneaky.  The best part of this game is that it has a lot of re playability.  You can either complete a mission and not kill anyone Ghost Style, complete a mission and kill everyone undetected Panther Style or just go loud, Run and Gun and let all the enemies know of your presence and use all types of weapons, Granades, Drones, Etc.  Assault Style.  Or just for fun Simply use a combination of all 3.  Either way you have a choiceThere is about 10 Single Player Mission each about 45-1 hour depending on difficulty and play style.14 Coop Missions.  you can either play alone, with a friend or online to find a teammate.  This is where the game is extra fun.  Having a partner to complete the mission you can work as a team and dual execute enemies or you can tackle one objective while your teammate handles the other objective.  At First coop missions is not easy until you get the hang of it.  So don't get frustrated.  Once you beat the first 2 mission and learn the controls and know what to do you will feel that its a lot of fun.This game doesn't seem as linear because you can play the missions again and find a different entry point and play using a different strategy.  example  you can either go to the roof and enter the building, climb and enter through the window., go to the basement or find a vent to go through.Multiplayer -  You can choose between first person or third person mode.  Multiplayer is just like any other game.I've only played Splinter Cell Conviction and the original and I would say BlackList is the best game so far.Controls are Improved. and very smooth, easy and responsive.  You can fluidly go from cover to cover with ease.  Aiming is precise.Lots of weapon and gear customization.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

Redmond","summary":"Oh man... every bit as good as the first and then some.","reviewText":"So, I was a bit skeptical because of Naughty Dog's decision to go with a dilapidated urban environment instead of the lush tropical setting, mostly because almost EVERY other game that has come out in the last decade that is worth anything has been either dilapidated urban or dilapidated post-nuclear holocaust.  Well... I was wrong.  Not only did they do the rough urban atmosphere perfectly, there are parts of even it that are really gorgeous.  That aside, there is still a lush tropical area and the snowy mountainous areas are just as gorgeous.  This game really is beautifully done.  My only complaint is that a title as good-looking as this could surely have benefited from being in 1080p (what's with all of the PS3 games being 720p only?)As far as gameplay goes it is every bit as fun as the first, and they even improved on some of the mechanics of the game (no more sixaxis grenade throws!).  They may have gone a little farther than the first game when it comes to cinematics.  There are more characters and the cutscenes are far longer.  So far this hasn't detracted from my enjoyment of the game, however.  I like that this is an action game that actually has a story.  Some of the action is pretty crazy (what I've seen so far).  There have been a part or two of the game that made my jaw drop and laugh out loud at the same time.  There seems to be little separation between the gameplay and the cutscenes... even when you are playing it feels very cinematic.I haven't gotten to the end yet, for all I know I'm not even halfway.  Judging from the last game and the amount of this one I've played so far... the only thing that will really disappoint me at this point is if they decide to not do an Uncharted 3.  Naughty Dog has really earned their place in my mind (I was never a Ratchet fan).  I can't wait to see what they do next.  (And I certainly hope it's Uncharted 3).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

I had a few issues with illegal errors occurring, but they few and far in between.I think the game is a great landmark for gamers that like stealth killing. It reminded me very much of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, but since Ubisoft developed both games, I'm not surprised. The nice thing about the original AC is that you don't have to worry about weapon upgrades, armor, rations, or currency. This games omits the worry of grinding for better gear or prepping your character for boss kills. If you deviate from the original story that Altair lived, you will know it (no room for forgiveness, which I guess makes the gameplay somewhat linear). You have the option to collect capital flags, but they really don't DO anything except entertain you when you want to stray from the main story. I'd recommend playing the game twice because some of the elements from Abstergo make no sense the first time around for someone who is new to the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

Mullins","summary":"Baulder's Gate Goth Cousin","reviewText":"Bioware has the Midas touch, Baulder's Gate, Torment, Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, they pretty much own the American RPG market and for good reason. Have they struck gold again with Dragon Age? I think so. Dragon Age is another work of art and stands equally with its older brothers. The story is a bit cliche, but told so well and with such polish that you don't notice much. The character development has much in common with Mass Effect. You will spend a good deal of time walking around camp and talking with your fellow party members, gaining trust of finding love. The NPC characters themselves are very well detailed and with rich personalities and back stories.The intro to each character, which is where the Origin in Dragon Age: Origin comes from, are nice treat. I wish that they had a little more to do with the progression of the story. While its true that you may meet some people from your origin story and there are some consequences it doesn't have the impact I'd expect.The AI for both enemy and ally is pretty good but does stutter at times. This pays off a great deal on consoles where the ability to micromanage your party isn't as easy as on PC. I was able to play through the majority of the game allowing my party to operate on their AI behavior. To that extent you are able to customize response and actions for your various party members which really helps.Graphic and gameplay wise Dragon age looks and plays very much like Mass Effect. It is polished and well done but not the 'next generation' engine some people were expecting. There are occasional graphic and gameplay glitches during some transitions from fights to cut scenes but nothing game breaking. The load times on the PS3 can be a bit annoying and takes a little longer than I'd expect. The inventory system is a bit annoying and could have been better but really I am nit picking.All said and done I spend almost 30 hours straight over a long weekend playing through this and saw probably less than half of avaliable quests. There is a ton of gameplay available for the money and even more with the promise of more downloadable content. I think this is another winner for Bioware and if you enjoyed any of their previous work you will love Dragon Age Origin.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2009"}

As everyone has already mentioned, it's no-brainer for $200.Pros: Incredible 1080i picture that blows away any HD transmission from your cable/satellite provider even at 1080i - at least on my HDTV. Runs much quieter than the noisy regular DVD drive of the XBOX 360 Up-scales regular DVDs. I did a real-time comparison with a regular DVD movie and quickly switched it from the XBOX 360 regular DVD tray and then into the HD-DVD player. I witnessed an incredible upscale in visual quality to the point that it was almost as good as an actual HD-DVD movie. The other amazing thing about my little experiment was that since both drives are \"powered\" through the same XBOX 360 processor/\"brain\", upon switching from one drive to the next, the XBOX was \"smart\" enough to pick up right where I stopped to the exact second in the scene from the regular DVD player. I was pretty impressed by that. Not sure how I would apply that again in the future, but it was cool nonetheless.Cons  - And it's a major one if you own any of the Sony SXRD line of HD TVs: No HDMI output = No 1080p picture if you own a Sony SXRD line of HDTVs like me. I have the amazing Sony SXRD 50\" rear projection LCD TV which defies logic at how sharp the picture is and how vivid the colors are in HD. With that said, I have yet to enjoy a 1080p picture on it because: 1) My cable provider transmits only a 720p/1080i picture (which I believe every satellite/cable provider is currently limited to in the US), and 2) XBOX 360 can only \"transmit\" a 1080p picture through a VGA cable. Though my TV does have a VGA input, a 1080p picture can only be possible utilizing the HDMI inputs. Conflicting XBOX Helpdesk support- When talking to XBOX support, their helpdesks gave me conflicting advise about whether or not my TV would project a 1080p picture through my VGA input. However, when I touched base with Sony, they were quite clear that the VGA connection for my TV would only go up to 1080i. The HDMI cable was necessary for 1080p.You might say, \"So freakin' what?\" However, when you've paid a considerable amount of money for a TV that has 1080p capability over a substantially less expensive TV that can only go up to 720p/1080i - you get the drift.Hopefully, Microsoft can come up with a HDMI solution for current XBOX 360 owners (not just the rumored XBOX 360 version 2) and this problem will be solved.

It's a wonderful spinoff/streamline from the early SMT titles and has a lot of great character, vibe and good design.While it's true that it is a bit dated in certain areas, it's almost in a charming way. Your hand isn't being held, you're not being bogged down with nonsense and it's very smart and with a lot of dials to turn, so to speak. There are little bits of cludge, but they don't really detract and to be honest the 1997-era FMV is almost...cute.The narrative itself is very peppy, fun to follow and the characters are great. It's also wonderful to go back to this era of art, without all of the cherub faces and shiny skin and over focus of cute-ness or little girls we have today. Designs are very creative and full of character. Lots of grit and inspiration but while still being colorful and not pandering. It's hard to explain, but it's a nice trip back to a time where everything wasn't just a trope.Sound work is solid overall, not standout, music is largely filler-esque in most areas and a bit of a weak point for the series. Voice work is competent and easy on the ears but no one ever really goes above and beyond in any performances.Dungeons are great. Big, twisty mazes, lots of supplements to make them a great crawl for anyone, with new adjustable difficulties and automapping features. Combat is standard SMT (ie; more in-depth Pokemon, although let me clarify that Pokemon spawned from SMT, not the other way around, so I dont get yelled at!). I've missed standard SMT interactions, it's fun to go into a battle and not necessarily have to fight but just hold a conversation or do some bartering.Game has a few warts and some very mild bugs such as text scrolls, but that shouldn't take anything away from it. It's a meaty RPG classic and meant for fans who know what a good, mechanical RPG is and can appreciate the unique styles and vibes we got from the 90s with the genre.

For example, if you are more accurate with your shots,you get Marksman points. Using gadgets, such as breaching a door or using a grenade gives you Close Quarters points. If you successfully opponent's defenses of shield and cover, you get Assault points. This is just a hint of the points system. The more points that you get, the more you can move up in rank. Moving up in rank can unlock different weapons and gear. This has a little more to offer than COD4 because you can unlock differnt things, such as helmets, more heavily armored vest, uniforms, etc. They seem to be copying COD4, but they actually reward you more for your achievements.

The Disney Infinity System is far superior in the sense that the player isn't as limited in the gaming experience. There is more to do.  The graphics are better. The entire experience seems more fun. I'm saying this as on of the minority individuals who is not a huge Disney fan. It is a cute system.  Needless to say, as soon as his younger brother got a turn at Infinity, he no longer wanted anything to do with Skylanders.There is additional investment of characters and discs.  I think that, depending on the players level of interest and what they enjoy doing in the game, this may or may not be an issue.  My son has played extensively with the game and I bought one extra character and one set of discs. He could care less. He's doing something and he's having fun.  Whatever the additional dices and characters are needed for are not on his current agenda and my bank account is thankful for that.Great game.  I do know there will be some hoopla in the house when Agent P is available to order.  Regardless of the agenda... we must have Agent P. I do recommend the system, especially at the current price point.  I did buy my system locally but have ordered the accessories through Amazon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"austin_Larry","summary":"Really enjoyable, great buy as a greatest hit","reviewText":"I bought the PSP version right when it came out and did enjoy it. After having played that I was not in a hurry to get the PS3 version until it came down to greatest hits price.Once it did, I bought it and have really enjoyed it. There are a lot of things to like about Force Unleashed. Interactive environments (very interactive environments), enjoyable force powers, good story line, even some humor thrown in. The graphics are good, not trailblazing, and the game play is not all hack and slash; you need to problem solve and use your force powers creatively. But when you want to unleash your light saber you can.The game was well thought out and has if not super highpoints of the best PS3 games, a lot of solid and enjoyable points. At the greatest hits price, must get for a Star Wars fan and a very good get for anyone who isn't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2010"}
