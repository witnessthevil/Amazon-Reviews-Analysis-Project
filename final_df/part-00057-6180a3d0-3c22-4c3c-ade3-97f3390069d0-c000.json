The idea of a Luigi expansion pack seemed fun. Adding new levels to Mario Bros U also sounded fun. I have to admit I was very disappointed when I got my hands on this game.First of all do not expect any new areas.  This game is a rehash of Mario Bros U.  The overall map is the same as are a lot of the mechenics.  That only thing you really get in this game is an overlay for the actual levels.  They are all different and for the most part seem to be more challenging. Luigi himself is slightly different from Mario. He handles differently which may take you a while to get used to.The biggest disappointment I got from this game was the fact that it didn't feel like I got anything new. I didn't feel like the game was enhanced.  It felt like I only got more of the same. That's not something I want out of an expansion pack.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular","reviewText":"Square Enix comes out of nowhere with The World Ends With You, which ends up not only being a spectacular RPG, but also ends up being one of the absolute best games available for the DS.  Taking place in Tokyo, you start out playing as Neku, and are forced to complete tasks.  Failing to do so will do nothing more than just erase you from history is all.  Though you can't really tell from that small synopsis, The World Ends With You features a dynamic and engaging storyline that draws you in, as well as some rich characterizations.  The first thing you'll probably notice is that the game features some simply gorgeous art design and stylish presentation.  The game also features an innovative and easy to get into combat system that is a breath of fresh air for portable RPG's, and the uses of the touch screen are wonderfully done as well.  As a whole, The World Ends With You makes great use of the DS' technical aspects, possibly the best uses that a third party game has done for the system yet.  If there are any drawbacks to The World Ends With You, it lies in the game's Tin Pin Slammers mode.  While it is just a fun little extra, there isn't really much to it.  Other than that though, nearly everything else here is flawless: the music, the character animation, the effects; things couldn't be much better.  All in all, it's rare that a game like The World Ends With You comes out of the blue and ends up being something so special.  That alone makes the game worth owning, and here's hoping that this is the start of a bold new franchise that can only get better and better from this point forward.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2008"}

Rhodes","summary":"Get Lost in the Abyss","reviewText":"The Good:+A very good story filled with engrossing characters+Very well crafted dialog makes the story entertaining+Incredibly fun battle system with a lot of depth+A game that looks rather good on the 3DS+The voice acting is actually very good+A lengthy quest filled with lots of side quests and secretsThe Bad:-The story can get bogged down in exposition-The 3D conversion isn't very good-There is nothing here that will convince those who invested in the Playstation 2 version to invest in this one; there are no 3DS exclusive extras hereIn 2006 Tales of the Abyss was released on the Playstation 2.  It's release was, unfortunately, overshadowed by Square-Enix's Final Fantasy XII.  It's a shame because several gamers missed out on a considerable gem.  And strangely enough, six years later the game is still just as good as it was then.  It's aged well, and now those who missed out before may have a second chance to experience it.Tales of the Abyss takes place in the fantasy world of Auldrant.  A world ruled by \"The Score.\"  An enormous stone that more or less tells the fate.  A fate that can't be changed.  And the one who is likely to change this is Luke Von Fabre.  He's a rich young man living in a manor.  He was kidnapped seven years prior and when he was rescued couldn't remember anything.  As a result he has been kept in the manor and sheltered during this time.  When training with his mentor Van, a mysterious woman named Tear breaks into the manor and in an failed attempt to assassinate Van, is suddenly transported away with Luke.  For the first time Luke is in the outside world.  But why was Tear trying to assassinate Van?  And what does Luke have to do with the score?  It all comes together.There are a couple of things about Tales of the Abyss's story that work on a lot of levels.  The first and most stand out are the characters.  It's got a fantastic ensemble cast.  These are charming characters who will develop and change throughout the story.  They each come with their own histories as well as their own personalities.  Luke becomes more than just the \"spoiled brat,\" for instance.  And his entourage are there to fill more than just the steretypical role you first come to meet them in.  The story is helped even further because it's got a lot of well orchestrated dialog.  It's funny at times and heartbreaking at others.  There can sometimes be too much focus on character, though.  In between story segments you can view skits that let you know more about the characters and they'll sometimes discuss certain plot elements.  They're usually humorous or add more to the story, or let you know more about the characters.  They pop up a lot, however.  You can, at times, feel drowned out in character development.The story also tackles some heavy themes, but manages to go about it in a way that isn't preachy like so many JRPGs have a tendency to do.  Despite what topical issues Tales of the Abyss brings up, you never feel like the game is lecturing, talking down to you or trying to teach you lessons all the time.  It's primarily there to be entertaining and fun.The Tales series does, from time to time, have a tendency to get a bit wordy and drowned out in exposition, however.  As entertaining as the story can be you'll find moments where you'll go to a town, hear all sorts of exposition and then be directed to another town (sometimes with no dungeon or battles in between) just to be hit over the head with more exposition.  In Tales of the Abyss this happens primarily because there's so much to take in.  The story can feel overwhelming at times and convoluted at others.  It's entertaining, but gets bogged down because of how much is thrown in.  So much so that it slows down not because the pacing of the game calls for it... but because the story has to take a moment to explain things to the player.Don't think this means Tales of the Abyss is absolutely no fun.  It's a lot of fun.  Particularly because the battle system is so amazing.  Tales of the Abyss, like many Tales games, uses the linear motion battle system.  You come into contact with the enemy and are whisked into a battle where you can move around freely on a line.  Soon you'll be able to free roam all you want without being on a single line.  You can attack normally or use special techniques called Artes.  It works in such a way that battling is actually quite fun.  But even the battle system adds layers at some point.  This isn't just mindless button mashing.  If you don't begin to learn some of the finer points of the battle system, Tales of the Abyss just might crush you.There are two things that add to the battle experience.  The first are the AD skills.  At some point you'll get capacity cores that can grant a bonus to stats as you level up.  As you get these bonuses you may also get AD skills.  Get enough bonus to your strength, for instance and you'll learn an AD skill that might add to your attack string (so you have five swings to an attack instead of just four).  The AD skills serve as a slight boost to your characters.  They start off basic, letting you free run or recover form an attack that knocks you away.  But soon you'll have longer combos, or perhaps a boost in speed during battle.  Maybe even skills that will let you recover a small amount of HP as you take damage.  You don't HAVE to play with these perks on either.  If you feel they are making the game too easy you can turn them off.You second thing is the field of fonons.  As you cast certain elemental spells certain fields will appear.  Stand in them and use an arte and some of your artes will morph and turn into different and more powerful artes corresponding to that element.  It's amusing stuff.The only issue is that it takes a while before the game actually introduces you to the AD skills.  You'll learn some, but you won't get a capacity core for quite some time.  Likewise, the game doesn't even bother to explain field of fonons for a LONG time (but the game doesn't have to explain it in order for you to take advantage of it).  Other aspects get introduced slightly later as well.  Every character has an overlimit gauge.  When full and they go overlimit they take half damage and don't stumble.  Until you get Mystic Artes (more or less Tales of the Abyss's form of a super attack) it seems like a useless perk.You only control one character in combat, however.  The others are controlled by AI, but they're usually quite competent.  Usually they'll heal characters without question or exploit enemy weaknesses.  The exception is that they sometimes will use items a little too freely.  Luckily the game lets you customize some of these things.  You can select for characters not to use items, for instance.  Or to focus primarily on physical attacks or magic.All these elements give Tales of the Abyss some depth to the battle system.  And it's important to try and exploit them.  The journey is long.  It might well take you sixty hours to complete the game the first time through.  However, the game has a lot of replay value as well as tons of optional content.  In nearly every town you visit there is something extra to do.  Small tiny quests.  Some connect to an even bigger quest where the reward is a special item, a weapon for a character or perhaps even a title (which impacts a characters stats).  There's a lot to explore in Tales of the Abyss.  The main game itself can take around sixty hours, but do all the optional content and the game can be double that.  There's also a New Game+ and you can alter the difficulty level in it.In terms of what's changed from the PS2... there isn't very much.  Although you will be impressed that they were able to port a Playstation 2 game to a handheld.  The game certainly looks nicer on the 3DS as it looks a lot smoother and the presentation looks a little cleaner.  The load times are also vastly improved over the Playstation 2 version.  Most everything else is about the same, however.  The voice acting is still very good and well delivered and it's nice that they retained it here.  The music also still sounds good coming from the 3DS's speakers.  What doesn't work out so well is the 3D.  Like some of your favorite movies, some games just don't make the transition to 3D well.  Tales of the Abyss is one of them.  The 3D simply doesn't add anything to the experience.  It isn't bad in battle, but Tales of the Abyss doesn't offer many other moments where the 3D is likely to enhance the experience.  In most cases, you wouldn't even notice the game was in 3D at all.  You're better off playing with the 3D turned off.  Aside from that, the only other difference is that there is absolutely no multiplayer anymore.  Even if you and a friend own the game, it's completely gone.Aside from that, the game is virtually unchanged from the Playstation 2 version.  There are no extra bosses or new sidequests thrown in exclusively for the 3DS.  It's pretty much a straight port.  This begs the question... is the game worth getting if you already have it on the Playstation 2?  Well, that's hard to say.  It's a smoother looking and running game, but the lack of any real extras doesn't really make it worth while for those who have the Playstation 2 version.  Unless you really want it on the go or you just want to relive it there's no reason to pick it up if you've still got your Playstation 2 version.  Those who have never played it and happen to have a 3DS, however, will definitely enjoy the game if they're looking for something to keep them busy for a while.Tales of the Abyss is still a good game.

{"product_name":"B000OYITQO","description":"XBOX 360 WIRELESS CONTROLLER BLACK","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"No More Wires","reviewText":"The one thing that I absolutely love about this console generation is that the three companies have finally evolved past wires.  The days of having a chord plugged into your consoles are long gone, and I'm glad.  So many times when I was younger, I recall playing video games and having someone trip over the chord because they were in a hurry to get by.  This usually resulted in the console falling to the floor due to the force in which the control chord was pulled during the process.  Now, none of my consoles have ever fallen onto the floor since no one can ever trip over the chords.The Xbox 360 controller is great and feels extremely comfortable.  The two analog sticks have a nice grip to them, and the shoulder buttons are easy to access due to the curvature of the back of the controller.  The controller's curves make it easily fit the shape of the player's hands, and the positioning of the battery cover is out of the way yet still also gives your fingers something to rest on providing extra grip.  The four face buttons are a nice size, and the even spacing between them allows for quick hit and release and transition from one button to the next.  This is very beneficial in games that require large combos where the button range is widely varied.The center Xbox button allows you to quickly access the dashboard.  Once on the dashboard you can either sign in/out, load music, turn off the controller, turn off the system, and tons of other extra features.  The controller runs off of AA batteries.  A complaint that many have against the controller.  However, I find this to be a major plus for the controller.  Simply purchase rechargeable AA batteries for under 20 dollars and you won't have to worry about constantly throwing away batteries.  Since the controller does not feature a built in battery, this also means that you don't have to worry about taking the controller about to change the battery once it no longer holds a charge.  Instead, a simple change in rechargeable batteries and you're good to game again.The d-pad is rather awkward, and its design is my only complaint against the controller.  The d-pad is built exactly like the one found on the Sega Genesis.  The Genesis had a bad d-pad and this also reflects on the 360.  In fighting games especially is when you notice just how bad the directional buttons on the pad are.  In Street Fighter, for example, Ryu's special move is done by pressing down, down-forward, forward + Punch.  On the 360 d-pad, it sometimes mistakes the down for a down-forward, and the forward sometimes even for an up-forward.  This is the only problem with the controller, otherwise it is very stellar, very durable, very reliable, and free of all chords.  You can't go wrong with this controller, and you can't go wrong with choosing it any color either, I chose the black due to personal preference.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

McAdams","summary":"Wow, just, ... wow!","reviewText":"I didn't know it was possible to love a mouse this much!One of the reasons I keep coming back to Logitech as a company, is because unlike certain other companies who shall remain nameless (but not blameless), Logitech keeps making REAL efforts to improve their products every generation.  Sure, some of their ideas don't pan out well (hi track balls!) but when they figure out they have a bad idea, they tend to tweak it, or pull it.I am a proud owner of almost the entire history of mice from Logitech, dating back to their simple green and black mice with no names from the 1990's, to their MX 510 and MX 518 \"gaming mice\" to their G5 \"gaming mouse\" and now this one.All of the \"gaming mice\" had adjustable sensitivity levels.  The G5 and the G500 also have adjustable weights.  What the G5 had, which the MX series didn't have, was the rugged cord (which was also longer, which was quite nice), and the weights.  What the G500 has, which the G5 didn't have, is on-board memory, programmable macros for sensitivity, and the new easy glide wheel.  I think it is the wheel which I love the most.  You can click it back and forth between super-fast glide mode, and the more traditional \"clicky\" mode, which is slower.  It will also increase/decrease speed, depending on what resolution you have it in.Another bonus over the G5 that the G500 has, is that EVERYTHING works right out of the box, WITHOUT software.  Since I am not the type of user who will EVER be programming my mouse, or storing macros in it, I LOVE that!  I actually had problems with the G5 that I ended up having to contact their customer support about, due to the \"back\" thumb button not working properly (it only worked in certain contexts).  The G500, however, has none of those problems.  They also got rid of my other major complaint about the G5, namely the overly sensitive right mouse button which was always getting accidentally clicked when you held the mouse in any way other than a very specific way I guess the G5 designer assumed everyone would hold it (read: not naturally).  They have changed the angle a bit in the G500 to eliminate that, and also made the click slightly less easy to happen on that button.To top it off, the annoying rough texturing from the G5 has been moved to just the lower portion where your palm is, and where your thumb is.  It is back to smooth for your fingers, and the mottled gray and back looks very nice too.Overall, 5 star product, I love it!  Well worth the money!  I paid more than they are asking now for this model, when I picked up my G5 model.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B007FMSDU0","description":"","reviewerName":"Gargus","summary":"Why you should buy the Vita version instead of the 3ds.","reviewText":"I will dispense with reviews of the game itself since there is overwhelming positive comments on the game across the internet and I for one share in them and do like this game very much. I will however give the reasons as to why I recommend the Vita version over the 3ds. I own and have played the Vita version and compared it to my friend's 3ds copy.1- The vita has superior looking graphics. Partly due to the fact the game was designed around the Vita itself, partly due to the superior hardware of the Vita and partly because the Vita version has uncompressed graphics. It looks much nicer on the Vita. The 3ds version has compressed graphics when in comparison don't look nearly as good and if you try to play it in 3d the graphics take a slight dip even further as do all 3ds games. The widescreen aspect of the Vita also helps a lot. The colors are just more vibrant and sharper on the Vita.2- The sound is better on the Vita. Again it's due to the sound being uncompressed on the Vita while being compressed on the 3ds. It's slight, but noticeable.3- Game breaking save bug on the 3ds version. The 3ds version of the game in Japan had a bug in it which would destroy your save file and it has carried over into the American game. It's not guaranteed but a lot of people have run into it. If you save your game during certain portions of the game it will corrupt your save and you will have to start all over again. It's been verified by myself and others that the Vita version does not contain this problem.Other notes- The Vita version has trophy support if you're into collecting them. People have claimed the touch screen on the 3ds is far superior but what they don't understand is you can use a style on the Vita and get the exact same results, a simple and very cheap capacitive stylus works just fine on the Vita touch screen. I personally liked having everything on one screen instead of a split screen. You can take screenshots in the game. You get more save game slots while the 3ds has only one.All in all this is a great game and worth playing on either system but at the end of the day I cannot see any reason to not play it on the Vita as it is a better experience in every way.Sadly due to the numerous and glaring differences I could not rate the 3ds version higher.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2013"}

When I first saw True Crime: Hong Kong trailer on the Internet I really liked it since I enjoyed the very first game (Los Angeles) on my Playstation 2. But this game, even though it's a sandbox, it has its own identity. What does it mean \"own identity\"? Well, this game is not Grand Theft Auto clone, nor is it Saints Row one. It's very different from Niko Bellic's adventures we all have played in Liberty City (fantastic game, though).Wei Shen, our undercover police in Hong Kong, will captures us from the very beginning of the game. Action, melee attack specially, has a huge impact in this game. It reminds me Bruce Lee's films much more than Batman Arkham Asylum/City because Kung Fu is Shen's specialty.We have enough freedom to do anything we want in Hong Kong. The only thing I miss in a sandbox is to explore our map in a plane. Unfortunately, we have no planes here. Nevertheless, the map is not too big so we can explore it completely in our cars and boats. Skyrim has a huge map, right? And we did not need planes, right? lol Not a big deal, but it would be awesome to flight over Hong Kong, right? Just a minor detail, no drama here.Driving is excellent, so fighting is.You can upgrade your apartment, buy new clothes, new cars, learn fantastic movements that will help you to defeat your foes, etc.Graphics, on the other hand, are not impressive but this is the kind of game you should see as a whole. It's not as detailed as Uncharted, for example, but graphics are OK, not drame here either. The game, as a whole, looks well.Voice acting, in my opinion, is fantastic. It mixes English and Chinese very wise. I feel like I were in Hong Kong, for real.Overall, this is a terrific game that deserves a chance from sandbox lovers.I'm so happy Square Enix took it from Activision when they abandoned it. Even better, I have my Rico Rodriguez outfit for playing Just Cause 2 (Good game, but this is, my opinion, better because Sleeping Dogs has a good story).Sleeping Dogs is not perfect but I'm enjoying it so far. 4.5/5 because it takes risks (not many but it has taken a few such as melee attack) and it has succeeded.Enjoy it, believe it's good. Gamespot gave it an 8/10, and IGN an 8.5/10. It's a good and a polished product. You won't regret it since it's very fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

The last ones I found somewhat enjoyable but did not love were WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 and 2007. While not incredible wrestling games, they were much better than the games that would come out in the years to follow. I played 2008, 2010, and 2011, but I didn't stick with any of them, as I didn't care for the rosters or the gameplay. Due to the disappointment of recent wrestling games, I skipped WWE '12 entirely. But WWE '13 felt like a good time to jump back in since it brought back the Attitude era. I'm happy to say I jumped back in at the right time.While the graphics are still a bit off at times, because long hair still looks goofy and some wrestlers don't look quite right, the game's overall presentation is still really good. The lack of HUD features allows you to feel more immersed in the action, allowing it to feel more like a live wrestling show and less like a game. Some goofy animations and glitches still rear their ugly head every once in a while, too, but this is the best a wrestling game has been in years.As far as gameplay goes, honestly, I can't go too deep into this since I'm more of a casual wrestling game fan that just likes tight controls and smooth gameplay. It's generally a smooth game the majority of the time, but some animations are still pretty robotic and dated. However, I do believe the controls are much better than the controls in the 2008-2011 Smackdown vs. Raw games, as the controls in those games threw me for a loop and I didn't care one iota for them. The controls are vastly superior in WWE '13, in my opinion.The greatest thing about WWE '13, aside from the improved gameplay, is the roster and Attitude storylines. This is a game built for those of us with a fond remembrance of that era. The Attitude era was controversial, unpredictable, and exciting, which are all qualities missing from the current product. WWE changed their rating to entice the family and not the young male demographic, but it's lost a lot of its appeal in the process. Granted, you have some great wrestling talent like Daniel Bryan, CM Punk, Dolph Ziggler, etc., but it feels as though the product has become too dull, predictable, and, quite frankly, boring. Less weapons, less attractive Divas doing scandalous things, less top notch storylines and character building, less theatrics, etc. Most matches are pretty formulaic these days. Divas have definitely suffered under the current brand. Anyways, just because WWE's current product is lacking doesn't mean you can't find something WWE related that brings back the good ol' days, which is what WWE '13 does. Sure, they censor Austin's middle finger, which is pretty lame, and they censor anything that has to do with \"World Wrestling Federation,\" which is equally lame, but the rest of the Attitude mode is a top notch blast from the past that reminds us just how good that era of wrestling was.WWE '13 is a great game, but it's even better if your favorite era was the Attitude era.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

While I admit, it was an awesome game in its own right. I was anxious to round up the original for it. But, alas, I wasn't able to. Now, with the Gameboy Advance, I finally get the chance to check out the Classic. So, what can I tell you about Breath of Fire for the Gameboy Advance....Well, it's been an absolute blast to play. I hadn't been able to put it down since I got it for Christmas. I've even brought it to work with me a time or two to play. Graphically, it's very colorful and animated. There's alot of exploration, and things to do in the game. Hundreds of spells to do battle with and battles galore. You can even exchange items with your GBA link cable. For a classic RPG, I highly recommend it to all.Given it's not Final Fantasy but it's just as good. If not better in some respects. It's definately worth the price of admission.Do yourself a favor and check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Fun Game","reviewText":"This game overall is pretty fun. The campaign is really fun and has a great story. You start out as an ODST and you are separated from your squad. You wander around the city, looking for clues as to where your squad is, encountering enemies along the way. Every time you find a clue, you play as one of your missing troopers from your squad and find out how the clue got there and what is has to do with the story. When you play as one of the missing troopers, the plot played in is related to the plot from Halo 2. As always, Martin O'Donnell has created a great score for the game. There is a new game mode called Firefight, where you fight endless waves of enemies alone or with a friend. The further you get, the tougher your enemies get. The firefight mode is pretty fun, but none of my friends have ODST so most of the time I have to play by myself, which gets really boring. You can't do a matchmaking search, so you have to invite your friends in order to play. It also includes an extra disc which includes all of the maps for Halo 3, plus 3 great new ones, so you can do matchmaking, custom games, and forge on the extra disc (just not campaign). It's a great deal because all of the maps included would regularly cost about $20 or so. So unless you would do the campaign a lot, you won't need to get Halo 3 if you get this. Also, the extra disc isn't a download code; you have to put the extra disc in if you want to have all of the Halo 3 maps. I would recommend this game to anyone if their friends would play the firefight mode a lot or don't have the DLC for Halo 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"The One Who Critiques","summary":"A fairly decent addition to the Halo franchise","reviewText":"First off the game comes with all the Halo 3 map packs, so if your still playing Halo 3 multiplayer 6 years later well your in luck my friend!So let's get to why your reading the reviews, the ODST campaign. The game is about 4-6 hours long depending on how you play along with the difficulty setting. The gunplay is your standard Halo FPS the controls feel great for the most part and shooting feels very good. The setting is nice at first, but after awhile it becomes repetitive there is no variety of area's to explore which is one of the strongest assets in the Halo franchise. It sort of feels open world early on but soon you'll find out your pretty much restricted and it's really not worth straying off the beaten path unless trying to find recordings for achievements. The story is okay and it's pretty cool finding lost recordings in the city to learning how everything went down hill.For the most part the campaign is a solid addition to Halo lore and I recommend it for the price. It has its share of drawbacks but even so it stands tall over many recent FPS's in the market today.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2014"}

Although it is an open world game, its very linear.  Sure, you can steal cars and drive around for a while and pick fights with people, but that gets very old very fast.Good:1. Graphics are amazing.  I realize this game came out a couple years ago but the graphics are every bit as good as GTA 4 if not a little better.  One of the neat things is at the start of the game in Empire City its winter and you get the icey streets and snow and it looks really neat, then you go to spring later on and its a commpletely different feel.  I loved the detail.2. Compelling story.  It is very compelling, well written and very interesting.  Going through the story and discovering how it plays out and what happens is worthwhile and they were quite adept at creating characters we care about and are interested in.  Voice acting is very good as well.3. Cutscenes:  There were too many cutscenes in my opinion, at times it was like watching a movie rather than playing a game and I found that to be annoying.  That having been said, the cutscenes were compelling, interesting and did a lot to move the story forward.4. Scenario (Small Spoiler Alert):  I did like how things got changed up as part of telling the story.  You start out in WWII Italy as a soldier, go to Empire City at the tail end of the war, end up in jail where you have to play out a number of scenes, then you end up in 50's Empire City, etc with somewhat different cars etc.  The point is that you're playing a character's life from a given point and as the circumstances of that life changes, you get to play a little of it rather than simply being told Vito fought in the war or Vito went to jail.  You experience that and frankly this is one of the more brilliant aspects of the game and is something GTA actually could learn from.Another neat thing was how the music changes with the times.  I kinda liked that so instead of always hearing the same songs and stuff, in the 40's you get 40's music and war updates and 50's its more 50's oriented, etc.  Really helped create the mood.  Mood is very well done.  One of the reasons I suspect the 40's were dark, snowy, cold, bitter to create that feeling of war, poverty, hopelessness, etc.  50's get much sunnier and cleaner as there's more of a feeling of prosperity and hope, etc.  My point is that there are aspects of this game that are very well thought out that do immerse you in the feeling of this person's life.  That having been said, its such a beautiful world that is wasted by limiting your interaction with it to just the linear story.Bad:1. This is not GTA 4.  Meaning there is 1 story and you go through it in a linear fashion and thats it. There's no side missions, no side quests, no little things you can do here or there.  It's a track that goes A to Z.  I say this is unfortunate because the world of Empire City is so nicely detailed and has so much potential, that to have additional ways to earn and spend money and really immerse yourself into the city would have been nice.2. Faces:  I know I said graphics are amazing and they are. The faces are amazing too especially since this was a couple years ago.  That having been said, all the girls look the same to me.  Its as if they created 1 or 2 faces for females and then just copied it out.3. Interactivity:  There's not a whole lot of interaction in this world with various objects.  Sure you can run over signs and light poles and into cars and the cars do start to show damage fairly quickly and eventually stop working which is a nice feature like GTA 4, but other than stores, repair shops, etc, there's just not a lot of places to go and your options for interacting with strangers on the street amounts to picking fights with them.  I said this before but this is such a beautiful and interesting world, it would have been nice to be able to interact with it more on my own terms.4. You might mess around and drive for a bit which could chew up a couple hours before you realize its time to get going on the story.  As I said, its very linear so playing through the story gets you around 15-20 hours.  In my case a little more because of exploration and replaying chapters as needed to complete them.  If there had been side things to do, I'm certain this game could have gotten up to 50-100 hours in gameplay.  For a $30-$60 game, 20 hours is on the short side.  Since I paid $7.50 for my download from Amazon, I feel like I got a great deal and the game was well worth it.5. The ending.  This thing just came out of no where and was frankly pretty unsatisfying.  I finished the mission and before I knew it, credits were rolling.  I was like wait, what just happened?  It seemed like there were probably a few more missions left in the main story line to bring about some form of closure.  I mean what happens to this guy?  I have no idea.You can totally see that this game was built to be something more.  As others have pointed out, there  are a number of NPCs who seem to have been setup to give side missions, and there are references to \"more jobs\" from them, but no jobs are ever forthcoming.  I can only conclude that for whatever reason, and there are a lot of possibilities, all of these additional features that may have been planned on were never put in and the game was shipped as a more linear story.  If they decide to do a Mafia 3, I hope they learn from this and let the developers have time to create a game with all the parts actually working in it rather than stripping out anything that's not related to the primary story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003Q9RG9K","description":"","reviewerName":"PantsuPanic","summary":"Fighting the good fight","reviewText":"Valkyria Chronicles II is one of the most amazing strategy games I've ever played.  And I've been playing the genre since ye olde days of X-COM and Shining Force.  VCII is simply a wonderful evolution of the genre, thanks to its innovative BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones) combat system.  This method of turn based initiative versus real time execution reveals new stratagems that continuously improve in subtle ways the longer you play.  BLiTZ battling is just awesome, end of story.Speaking of story, a lot of people hated VCII's plot.  Well, by the end of the game, I actually cared about quite a few of these cadets, and the plot touched my heart in tangible emotive ways.  Not the least of which being the way this game handles racism.  I've never seen a game even talk about racism, let alone allow the player to witness first hand the effects of its ugliness and be affected by it directly.  That aspect alone proves VCII's story is more than just filler.Gameplay-wise, you will have a massive learning curve at the front of the game, all the way to the end you'll still be learning new tricks.  Granted I thought this game was too easy, but there are still times you'll actually have to use viable strategy to win, not just attrition.  My only true complaint against VCII is that it's ultimately all about quantity versus quality, insofar as mission design is concerned.  There are a TON of nearly identical missions in this game, I would have preferred less repetition and more variety in objectives and layouts.  Still, you're definitely getting your money's worth with this one, after you beat VCII the game unlocks bunches of new missions and extra secrets I won't spoil.All in all, I loved this game and I recommend it strongly to any SRPG fan out there.  After about 46 hours and a huge campaign, I walked away from VCII feeling like I'd had a wonderful experience, because VCII is all about the gameplay in the end.  It has a few flaws sure (Avan's laugh...), but not being fun is certainly not one of them.  Because when it comes to being absolutely entertaining, Valkyria Chronicles II is mission accomplished.  Do your part for the war... er, industry and buy bonds... er, this UMD today!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

The wait is finally over! From BioWare and the Microsoft Game Studios comes the ambitious and head-turning role playing game, Jade Empire.The game's designers have crafted an entirely new and unique world inspired by ancient Chinese myths and legends. In the primeval, arcane setting of the Jade Empire, you'll train under your master's watchful gaze and learn the mystical and magical powers of ancient martial arts. You'll travel widely -- from the rugged mountains of the Land of Howling Spirits to the luxuriant gardens of the Imperial City--as you make your way on your quest. Powerful human and supernatural foes will stand in your way, but with practice you'll learn to overcome your most powerful enemies. And as you venture forth through Jade Empire, you'll be challenged with questions that will ultimately lead you to discover the darkest secrets of the world.The game begins when a series of sinister events disrupt the peaceful harmony of an isolated martial arts school. You'll be forced to confront a slew of shady characters, evil warlocks, demonic beasts, and other atrocious villains that protect the Jade Empire's deepest secrets.Jade Empire offers you the chance to become a martial arts master. You'll assume the identity of one of six different characters and begin developing your skills. Each character has a unique appearance, voice, and fighting style. As you progress in the game, you'll decide whether to adopt the ways of good or evil, and your choices will affect your reputation.Jade Empire matches the frenetic pace and fury of Hong Kong cinema. As you progress in the game, you'll upgrade your combat ability and learn new, specially tailored moves for your character. Only by mastering your moves and defeating the most powerful enemies will you earn your place as a master in the world of Jade Empire.","reviewerName":"Preston L.

The problem this series has is that it tries to get you to care, only to not flesh out the characters enough over time. Just when you become remotely interested, certain people are taken away. This series uses death in the most senseless of ways. just because someone kicks the bucket, doesn't mean most will care about it. it should focus on being gritty, grimey, and as realistic as possible.

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward.

Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"D.

WWE All Stars I found hard to resist though: an arcade-style atmosphere with legendary brawlers like Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, Ricky Steamboat, Macho Man, Ultimate Warrior, Jake Roberts, and more besides mixing it up with current WWE superstars Randy Orton, John Cena, John Morrison, CM Punk, and others.  The game offers some great graphics and a hefty amount of gameplay modes (along with unlocking more wrestlers too) with the only drawback really being that the control scheme isn't easy to get a hold of when you first get into the game.  Maybe it's because I've stayed away from wrestling games for so long, but it took me a while to get used to it.  Once you do though, you'll have a blast with WWE All Stars.

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Robert S. \"geek hipster\"","summary":"Easy to Pick Up, Easy to Put Down","reviewText":"Been a fan of the series since Burnout 2:Point of Impact and on to Takedown and Revenge..

Playing against the computer however is a DIFFERENT story.  Playing under ROOKIE difficulty makes the game just that, but ridiculously easy.  When you set the game to PRO which is a step above ROOKIE, the A.I. is ridiculously too good! You can tinker with the A.I. settings so that the computer plays terribly, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I was using the Patriots and played against the CPU 49ers. Now, Alex Smith isn't exactly the best quarterback in the world, but with all the A.I. set to bare minimum, Smith consistently passed for 400 yards regardless of how well I played defense! Also, the 49ers were unstoppable and made my Patriots look like an NCAA team! I thought it was a glitch and just the 49ers in this game, so I picked Detroit. Same thing, Jon Kitna was passing on my Baltimore Ravens defense for almost 300+ yards and were unstoppable at PRO level. Of all the Madden games I've played, the A.I. is incredibly inaccurate and makes any team you pick for the CPU become very invincible.

You always make these simple ideas seem so grand and innovative yet when we play them they don't seem so. Why does Mr. Molyneux do this? No one may ever know, but it's probably best for him to keep him striving to make his games better, but Fable III isn't an amazing game at all, it's just a good game.Let's start with the story. Fable II had an awesome and memorable story, but Fable III tends to fall on a mediocre and typical one. You have to gather allies throughout the land of Albion to rise against your evil brother, but really there's a stronger force at hand (I won't say for spoilers). The whole story is generic and the characters aren't too memorable (except Reaver!), and following a nameless hero is getting old. Other than that it's decent and has a couple of twists, but it just treads on without doing much new to the series.Secondly is the combat, that Lionhead keeps changing with every game, is very simple yet there's a uniqueness to it. Each attack is mapped to one button firearm, melee, and magic. It's a mixed bag as to which you should use since magic is the deepest of the three. You can equip a different magic gauntlet to each hand and mix attacks, and there's 15 combinations in total. Holding down B will allow you to charge it for an area attack, but they made this weird control scheme where you have to press the analog stick toward the enemy to make anything go that way. This is annoying when using your gun because while you reload your walking toward your enemy so you have to stop pressing forward while you reload. There are some pretty gruesome fatality kills, but otherwise combat is a bit awkward and simple. On another note the enemies just swarm on you and don't really do much else and can lead to cheap deaths (mainly the Balverines), and there isn't a huge variety of them. Hobbes, humans, Balverines, wolves (early on only), Hollow Men, and pretty much every enemy from Fable II and not many new additions.As you kill things or do things in the game you can turn good or evil, and each weapon has three different criteria to make it a true heroic or evil weapon. This will also make it more powerful, but leveling up 50 legendary weapons? Fable III is full of unnecessary mundane things that only the hardest of hardcore will ever complete. The whole good and evil is used well here during the second half of the game when you become ruler. You decide the fate of people, cities, and other things to add money to your treasury (why you do this will spoil the story). It does make you feel powerful and is probably the best part of the story.The game features something very unique and that's your central hub. You can press the start button any time and you will go to a hub with your map, and everything else you need such as changing weapons, clothing, makeup, Xbox LIVE marketplace, Xbox LIVE co-op, the achievement wall, your treasury etc. It's very intuitive and unique (and there's no loading!) In the map you can fast travel to any city, and all gnomes, keys, and quests are marked so you can keep track of them. You can also buy real estate from the map instead or wandering around everywhere and doing it by foot.Secondly Fable is all about exploring and there is more exploring than there are main quests. There are a ton of side quests such as finding 50 gnomes, keys, and 30 Aurorian flowers. These are for opening silver chests, and just getting achievements, but you will need the strategy guide or some online guide because boy it is frustrating to find these things. You can find dive spots, dig spots, and books as well but it seems endless, and doesn't really pay off achievement wise (except the books).Another (almost) useless thing that has stuck around are relationships and expressions. Peter insists that these things are unique and innovative, but they really don't do anything except make it feel like something from The Sims. Expressions can be used to raise the like level or hate level. Go high enough and you can propose to someone. You can also have sex with people and catch STDs, but this only feels like it's for laughs more than anything useful. Another feature Molyneux pushed was the hand holding idea. This is not as great as he claims and is useless (and in disguise) of an AI pathfinding replacer. You only really use it to guide people around during certain quests, so don't get too excited about this.Lastly the game features a new way to acquire levels, expressions, jobs and other items through The Road to Rule. As you complete sections of the game you can purchase chests using Guild Seals that you get from defeating enemies or completing quests. This is an interesting way of upgrading, but you wouldn't miss it if it were gone. Secondly, the same goes for the those stupid jobs that you can do to make money. After you try each one you'll be done because it's mundane, and you don't earn as much gold after you buy up a lot of property.Overall, Fable III tries too hard instead of starting anew. The game looks the same as Fable II, and in turn, looks outdated with muddy textures, some low resolution models, and the only thing that looks good are far off vistas. The game also has a lot of British humor and may not suit everyone, but the voice acting is pretty good. With only a few side quests being memorable, a generic story, and some useless over hyped features Fable III is disappointing, but not as much as you'd think. If you liked Fable II you'll love this, but haters will still hate.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

These two become knights of the kingdom, only to be faced with a terrible war that threatens to doom their world.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Finding a Balance","reviewText":"Radiata Stories is a mission-oriented fantasy rpg set in Tottaus, a world which houses both humans, elves, dwarves and even orcs.  They may all live there, but they don't always get along.  Humans, the only mortal race are views with great suspicion and war is brewing once again.  In the background the dragons charges with keeping the world's balance begin the moves that will once again signal the destruction of mankind.In the midst of the disquiet, Jack Russell, the son of a famous knight, leaves home to find his on way to knighthood at castle Radiata.  He will make friends and enemies as he follows quests, builds his powers, and on day has to make a fateful decision about whether he will play on the human sight or join Ridley Silverlake, a young woman who leaves the knights to take up the cause of the fairy world.This is a critical decision.  On the one hand Jack follows a path of duty and destiny, and on the other path he finds love and community.  The choice is like a lightening strike in the middle of the story, as difficult a one for the player as it is for Jack.  Whichever way you decide to go, the game will never be the same.  For me this inserted an element of dissatisfaction in the tale, as one of the choices leaves you with disquieting doubts.  And you really do have to play both to get the whole game.Much of the game depends on Jack's efforts to befriend the people of Radiata and the surrounding lands.  This will be how he creates his teams for the missions and to recruit the better characters he must recruit many of the others.  Playing without a guide this is the real difficulty of the game.  Some characters are easily recruited with a word or a quick battle, but others take an effort to discover what they want and how to satisfy their needs.The battle system is real time, very much under Jack's control, with opportunities for him to learn skills from other characters.  It takes a while to fully understand the system, but once you do it becomes fairly intuitive.  Main story character interaction is primarily via cut scene, typical of mission game structures.  This is compensated for by the need to talk to just about every other character of the game.It is easy to understand the popularity of the game even though I much preferred one ending to the other.  Despite a tremendous amount of leveling up needed, I never felt the battles were overly repetitive.  Except when you're primed for battle level 70 team has to stop to demolish a couple of ants. Artwork, animation, and music are also well done.  A worthwhile game, but one that needs the addition of a guide for complete enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2006"}

Now, if you need more details, here's why:First, it's cute! The art style is just darling, and your animal neighbors (of which there are hundreds; every time you play, you get different ones) are all adorable. I'd take them over humans any day. Houses, trees, your own character; everything is pleasing to the eye and just darn kawaii!Second, the variety! Besides the vast number of animals that can coexist with you, there's an even bigger number of items to decorate your house, bugs and fish to catch, outfits to wear..the list goes on and on! Every single item actually has a use. The furniture can actually be moved and seen in your house, your catches can be displayed in the museum, and clothes are all clearly visible on your character. Speaking of clothes, if you can't find your own outfit, you can design your own, using a very versatile drawing program. I've designed dozens of outfits, and I still have more in my head. With all the variety, you could play as one character for years--or play as several different characters. The options are endless!Third, the special events! As time passes, all kinds of things happen. Special items can be collected if you participate in events on holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Halloween. Occasionally, visitors like a fortune teller, a clothes-designing giraffe, and a carpet-selling camel will come to town. If I described everything that could be done in this game, I would overload this site's database.I would say that this is the best simulation available right now. If you want \"adult\" humor, go to the Sims.

There is nothing wrong with this of course, it is just best to know before you buy that large portions of the game revolve around this.The story is fantastic, its not as far fetched as MGS2, and it has a real gritty 70s feel to it, without being too over the top. Playing through for the story itself is worth ride. The enemies are classic MGS, but some of the best in the series. Some of the boss fights, the End for example, are pure genius. It really shows how you can push game design when so many people are just worried about graphics.The game play can be frustrating at times, even on easy, until you find the right way to go about things. Every boss has some sort of weakness or strategy that works and once you find it you are generally fine. The weapons and equipment are great. They do very well in capturing the era and setting the game is trying to capture.Metal Gear Solid 3 is pure MGS, without being a carbon copy of the previous installments.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Enlightened \"Both Eyes Closed, see what u don...","summary":"Magical Experience!  Some people are just nitpicking!","reviewText":"I'm the type of person that does read the reviews of a game before it comes out (who doesn't??).  In general I know the reviewers of the big websites have to nitpick.  It's their job.  I also know that they have been playing the game for quite a while whether its early demos etc.  By the time they review the game they aren't really interested or engaged like a normal gamer.  However, when I purchase a game I don't have any background with it.  It's all new to me.  So how do I feel about it?I've read the reviews on here and some people have major issues with the game.  None of them related to how fun the game is though.The first major problem that people state about this game is the linearity and the absence of towns.  Whoopty freakin doo there's no random towns where you talk to random people and have random conversations about random relics that have nothing to do with the story.  Also the nature of what the characters are doing as well as the plot doesn't allow for \"exploration\".  First they are trying to find somebody and then they are on the run.  They are enemies of the state.  Is it really logical that they could just shoot the breeze in a town and chill at the inn???  Plus if they go to a town that area will probably be purged...it's best to stay out of sight.  And really....what is the point of a town????!?!?  Does it make the game not fun??In Final Fantasy 7 I don't recall being able to explore until the end or middle of Disc 2 when Cid fixed the airplane thing so is linearity that big of a deal?  Also in that game there was a point right before the finale where you could go level up your characters to your heart's desire and find all the materia you wanted before finishing off Sephiroth.Uncharted 2 is linear, Dead Space, Metal Gear Solid 4, God Of War, Call of Duty, Heavy Rain....all linear games whoopty doo.Another complaint about the game is that you only control the leader of the group.  That may be a problem for those micromanagers (who likes to micromanage anyway??  I have to tell you to fight this large thing that's about to kill us??? Be serious) but not for me.  However you do control what role everyone plays in battle and can customize armor and abilities to your heart's content.Speaking of battle, the paradigm switch is one of the best battle systems ever.  You must also be adept at switching as well and know what you're doing and who is doing what.  This is essential because each battle is graded...if you're slow and indecisive during battle the enemy will start to pummel you and after the battle the amount of stars and points you receive will decline.  The focus is on speed and effectiveness.  It's hard to explain and hard to learn  but once you get the hang of it, it will be second nature.Also some people state they just hit auto battle and win without trying but that is untrue because autobattle doesn't work all the time.  Sometimes you need to cast some spells, protect yourself, sync up hits with party members to increase chains and get the enemies to critical status, etc.  Maybe at the beginning of the game you can do that but where I'm at now (15 to 16 hours) doing that will get me killed.  Also when autobattle works it doesn't cast the ideal combination..it casts a combination that works but if you choose the actions yourself you will fare better.There are summons in the game but I haven't really gotten the hang of it yet (because you don't have to use them a majority of the time yet).The game's difficulty is right where it needs to be.  For a good portion of the game you only have two characters in the party (it goes to 5 for a brief second and then they all branch off).  You are going along destroying everything in your path until you get to a boss that will completely overwhelm you or a large horde of enemies that by themselves don't pose much of a threat but together provides a problem that you don't want or need.  There's also times when you should avoid an enemy because they are too powerful, you're too weak and you don't have enough people to compete.  There's also no fleeing a battle so if you get into some stuff you can't handle then you will just have to accept your fate.Auto-heal after battles is a love hate kinda thing.  You don't have to spend money on potions or anecdotes.  Personally that's one aspect of the battle system that I didn't like.  You should not magically heal after every fight.  I think they dropped the ball on that.Technical:Graphics, story, animation, characters and voice acting are all pretty good. The cutscenes are simply gorgeous...easily the best looking game I've seen on the PS3 thus far.  I see no slowdown, clipping, or screen tearing.  Movements are fluid, responses are fluid.That's pretty much all I have to add to everyone else's wonderful reviews.  This is a 5 star game, it's fun, has a great story and the best graphics to date.  Lose yourself in this world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}

This is my favorite.","reviewText":"I am a multi-console owner who also has a Xbox One (see my profile for Xbox One review). I was a huge supporter of the PS3/360/Wii and have the Wii U. I have to say of all 3 this is my favorite console of the next gen consoles. Why is that? It is simple in its user interface. It improves on the extended media bar by making adding another layer on top of it. Its like one media bar on top of the other. There is a lot of social aspects added into it that track your friends progress, not just by trophies but my special accomplishments and what they are watching. The trophies are now more special by giving an indication how rare they are. A new aspect is streaming your game live or making clips to post for others to see. It is easy to use and has a sleek simple interface.The controller is easily the most important aspect of the system. I am proud to see this is my favorite controller if this generation. It is very sturdy in the whole design, especially the triggers and the analog sticks. They are extremely tight which makes them feel they will last a long time. I was surprised how loose the PS3's analog sticks are in comparison and even compared to the Xbox One's controller. The speaker on the controller is loud and clear, more so than speaker in the wii-mote. The touch pad works smoothly and nice in games like Killzone: Shadow Fall.Now if anyone doesn't know, the PS4 is the most powerful console. It doesn't mean all games will look better than the competition but majority will. It was built with a lot of developer input and designed to get away from the difficult ridiculous design of past Playstation development tools which hampered it from being able to have the best version of games and not having enough RAM to compete to have the same quality of titles in games such as Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Sony has answered this with DDR5. It also has some of the leading developers such as Naughty Dog, Media Molecule, Sony Santa Monica, Quantum Dreams, and Sucker Punch.If you want the most powerful system, a greatly improved controller for FPS games. A console that innovates and takes rich with new IPs such as Flower, Journey, Unfinished Swan, and the LittleBIGPlanet than Sony is the choice who takes the lead and doing so with new games like Octodad, Rosogun (the best next gen game right now), and a lot of other indies but also one who provides a trend of bringing new big AAA experiences such as The Last of Us, Infamous, Uncharted, than the PS4 is a good choice. That trend is continuing with new games such as The Order: 1886 and old ones such as Uncharted 4 and Infamous: Second Son.Games Played (and own) on PS4:ResogunBattlefield 4 (beaten)Killzone: Shadow Fall (beaten)Assassin's Creed: Black Flag","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"terpfan1980 \"Barry\"","summary":"I'm very, very happy with my purchase of the Sony Playstation 4.","reviewText":"Main review here:As I note below, I'm very, very, very happy with the purchase of my Sony PlayStation 4.  I have been greatly enjoying the gaming that I've done on it so far (over the first week since its release).  Understand though, that despite my happiness with the system, there are some areas that need to be and hopefully will be improved in the not so distant future:* Bluetooth support for headsets (third party and/or Sony manufactured)* The release of a media remote control, either third party or Sony's own.  With the lack of support for PS3 peripheral usage, there was no way to use the existing PS3 Blu-ray remote control with the PS4 :-( and &#60; mad smiley! &#62;-- note to above, there is a third party media remote control due to be released at the end of December 2013 that should help in this area, but it adds a slight negative in that in order to use it, you must place a USB dongle into service that will mean losing the use of one of the available USB ports on your PS4* Sony's continued lack of support for IR remote controls.  As with the PS3, Sony insisted on NOT building in InfraRed remote control support, so the use of IR remote controls, especially useful for those with fancy 'universal' remote controls (such as the Harmony series) are left in the cold again.  I would have hoped that Sony learned their lesson about this with the previous generation, but no such luck.* No 3D Blu-ray playback at release of the system.  That should be resolved in the future, but it is yet another reminder that to some extent Sony (and Microsoft, who had the same limitation on their Xbox One platform at release) rushed to put out release date hardware that is not feature complete at the time they put it out on the market.* No MP3 or CD playback at release of the system.  Not that I intended to be using this device for such playback, but some people would and/or did with the PS3 and that is a drawback to the system until it is corrected.* No DLNA support at release of the system.  Yet again, hopefully fixed in the not too distant future, but lacking at release of the system.* The Blu-ray drive is a slot-loading drive that sits in the system in a manner that some might find confusing based on the way the system is assembled.  The drive sits to the left front of the device, partly under the shiny black plastic cover, and partly under the more matte plastic area, with the eject button and power button on the systems lined up over a portion of the drive slot rather than being completely to the left or right of the drive slot as one might expect.  This seems to have been a case of Sony being too smart for their own good in trying to hide or minimize the thought of using the drive.  While the future may be digital distribution of content, the drive in this device is likely to be used over and over again and hiding it shouldn't have taken precedence.  It should have been easy to find, as should have been the power button and eject buttons.* Speaking of which, yeah, the power button and eject buttons are easy to see, yet not so easily identified as to which button does what.  There are markings on the button for power that are there, but awfully small and not so easily seen.  There is no reason anyone should have to consult a cheat sheet or user guide as to what button does what and yet Sony has put the system together in a manner that doesn't really cooperate in that area.* At least initially there seems to be no way within the system configuration to turn off or mute the microphone that is built-in to the PlayStation 4 camera -- except for plugging in a separate headset/microphone that would have to have its own mute button on it.Things that I like about the system:* Less expensive than it's competition, even with the addition of the very nice PlayStation 4 camera (which I do recommend)* The controllers have a nice feel to them.  In the initial release of the last generation of PlayStation (PS3), the original controllers (Sixaxis controllers) were too light for my tastes and just didn't feel that comfortable for my taste.  I really like the feel of the DualShock 4 controllers, and the weight that they have.  I don't want them to be too heavy, but don't want them so light weight that I can't tell that I have one in hand (which was my problem with the Sixaxis controllers for the PS3)* Setup is pretty simple.  'nuff said in that area really.* The new interface is pretty slick and easy to navigate through.Neutral for me, but probably negative for others:* The need to have a PlayStation Network (PSN) membership for many gaming features.  On the PS3 the need to have an active PlayStation Network account (membership, fee based) was minimal.  Not so with the PS4.  Sony has basically copied their competition here and pretty much requires PSN membership which brings a yearly fee with it.  It is (to me, and to many others) worth the fee, but others might complain and so I note that issue here.How are the games?At the time of release, the games are good, but still a bit rough around the edges.  We are obviously at the start of the next generation in console gaming (at the time I'm writing this review).  A few years out we'll be (hopefully) seeing games that truly push the limits of the next-gen hardware, and we'll see the PS4 and Xbox One systems doing things that truly impress us, at least for a few years.  Eventually these/those systems are going to be 'old' and 'long in the tooth' and we'll be pining for the next next-generation to come along, but for now, the games that we're getting, well, they are pretty nice even if they aren't overly impressive.Graphics in some of the release day games are good, mildly impressive, but just not where we all expect they'll wind up being.  It really is a matter of the developers learning how to do things on these new devices.Games I like:  Call of Duty: Ghosts.  First person shooter that looks pretty nice and plays well.  Later we'll look back at that game as being one that seems so crude by comparison to later releases in that franchise. :-p  Knack.  Knack has proven to be a lot more fun than I had expected.  Very Crash Bandicoot-ish.  Easy to play (at least on the 'easy mode' that I prefer for now) and yet still a lot of fun.  Battlefield 4.  An alternative to CoD: Ghosts.  Assassin's Creed.  Beautiful game, looking forward to playing through it completely.  Lego: Marvel Super Heroes.  Just a ton of fun, especially for younger audiences.  Madden 25 is OK for a football/sports game fix, but isn't necessarily something that I'd recommend buying.  It is nice, but it continues to have issues that nag me too much to spend money buying it.End rating: 5 stars.  Note that I might also give the Xbox One 5 stars if I were rating it, but I'd be doing so more from my love of the systems as I expect them to be, rather than as they are right now.  Neither are perfect, both will eventually improve, and both should continue to push the other to be better for all of us to enjoy.History lesson follows:I'm very, very happy with my purchase of the Sony Playstation 4, though I must admit that when I made the pre-order I was really not sure that I'd be able to come back and say that.Let me start by saying that in the previous generation, I was very much a fan of the Playstation 4's main competition, the Xbox 360  I liked the Xbox 360 an awful lot.  To the point of 'when you can pry it from my cold dead hands'.  Despite multiple issues along the way, mostly the notorious red-ring-of-death that was experienced by most early adopters of the Xbox 360, I still very much loved that system.  Why?  Xbox Live primarily.  It was head and shoulders above anything that anyone else could offer.  The ability to quickly and easily socialize with other gamers that you were playing with or against took console video gaming to the next level.  In FPS (first-person-shooters) this was great because you could plan team maneuvers in the games, while in more social (arcade type) games you could sit and socialize with old friends or new that you happen to make from your travels (as an example, I wound up making several friends by sitting and playing the Xbox Live Arcade version of Uno for many thousands of games).I owned a PS3, a couple of them in fact, but I really only ever used them as media players.  Blu-ray players primarily.  Gaming on them just didn't feel as comfortable to me.  My friends were gaming on Xbox Live, and I wanted to be there with them.  The games seemed nicer/better on the Xbox 360 (though normally it would be a draw as to which system had the better version of any one game).  The whole experience just seemed nicer on the 360, so my PS3's sat lonely most of the time.Years later, when the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were announced I followed the news anxiously, looking for reasons to choose one platform over the other, and I fretted over which system was going to be the right one for me.  I wanted to stay with the Xbox line, but was leery of rumors of new features and/or new ways of installing and use the software on the system enough that I held back waiting for the official announcements of what was coming.  Once those announcements hit, I found myself unable to place any faith in Microsoft that what they were promising was not going to be incredibly harmful to myself and to other gamers.  The ability to trade in old software, sell off used games, and other similar things was going to be gone, or severely limited and restricted in ways that I just couldn't support.  A day or two later, Sony announced what they'd be doing with the PlayStation 4 and at that point, they were instantly the gamers best friends.  No restrictions on selling or trading away disc-based copies of games.  Yay!  Other seemingly draconian restrictions that Microsoft had talked about were also non-existent in the Sony world.  Double Yay.  I quickly placed a pre-order for a Launch Edition (Release date) PS4 system here and then waited impatiently for it to be released.Over the course of the next very volatile few days, Microsoft took a beating in the court of public opinion.  They wound up back-tracking on almost all of the new paradigm they had promised (some would say threatened).  In the end, they pretty much offered up a continuation of what they had done previously, but for me, and many others it seems, it was too little too late.  While I could still have placed an order for an Xbox One system, I had cast my die and my seething and hatred of what Microsoft had said they were going to do couldn't be quelled so easily.Here, (at the time I'm writing this), months later, both systems have been released, and I've been enjoying the use of my PS4 for the first week of it's life.  After installing the requisite launch day patch, there's since been one other firmware upgrade.  There are still features that aren't quite working yet, but should in the future, and certainly patches that will continue to come.  The competition between both major parties will ensure that continues to be the case.End of history lesson.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Some weak mechanics and plot points can't kill the shine","reviewText":"Dead Rising 2 follows Chuck Greene, a survivor of Willamette trying to make ends meet and support his infected daughter, taking up death sports to pay for her expensive medication. During an outbreak at Fortune City, Chuck is framed for the release of the zombies causing the outbreak. Why would a horde of zombies only be secured by one weak fence, and how could they spread to all points of the map in seconds?... And why is there only apparently one emergency shelter in place for such an outbreak?......Uhm... moving on.Dead Rising carry's over a majority of the mechanics from its predecessor with quiet a few improvements. Text is legible. The walkie is no longer as annoying, and can be ignored easily. Save points are more evenly sprinkled throughout the areas. Giddy points and disappointments are found with the combo weapons, which are tons of fun, but disappointing that you can't make them at their best until you unlock the \"combo card.\" The camera has been removed, and I rather enjoyed that about DR1. In its place are bonus points for a much larger variety of activities and using combo weapons, which means you'll be using mostly combo weapons once the opportunity presents itself.The Gameplay is otherwise just as you remember. Fight from group to group, grabbing new weapons as old ones break, collecting book powerups and hunting for rarer and more devastating toys. The number of weapons has gone up, though not as much as expected, though a larger area and more room to explore mean its somewhat easier to skirt groups rather than slog through everything. Levels and unlocks carry over as usual, making restarting almost strategic rather than frustrating. The level is much larger and more sprawling, but apart from being rather slow on foot, is easy to navigate and doesn't look cookie cutter from section to section.Audio and visuals are as crisp as to be expected. The only deficiency is how few lines are used by the survivors and bystanders. Cinematics are fully voiced and well detailed.Overall, the games what you've come to expect. Probably the most major downside is some of the times that were removed from the initial game that I'd have liked to see kept, and the lack of a sprint button. Those and some gaping plot holes right from the start are the only major smudges on whats otherwise a game thats just as fun as the original.Addendum: I was having internet trouble initially, but I've finally gotten opportunity to play the mini game Terror Is Reality online. They have unranked games for you to get no money and no achievements, or ranked games to win money and achievements with no appreciable down side. The mini games are actually a lot of fun, have enough variety that you must play through at least 3 - 4 games to even try them all, as they are random, and you can win more cash in 5 minutes than you can in 5 hours in the actual game, making getting that shot of Zombrex a piece of cake. Not only did they make games that're fun and easy to pick up, they have a very real, very large bonus for use in game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Stumbles at the finish line","reviewText":"Despite being called the Super Mario Bros, Luigi hardly gets attention. He starred in a lame SNES game(Mario is Missing), was in Super Smash Bros. Melee but his moves were exact same as Marios. He wasn't even in Mario Sunshine. Has a launch title, Luigi's Mansion shows off some of the Gamecube's power but the gameplay itself leaves something to be desired.Story: Luigi wins a mansion in a contest he doesn't even remember entering. He tells his brother Mario to be there. Mario in effect has gone missing and there's ghosts all over. But thanks to Professor Gadd and his Poltergust 3000, Luigi can vacuum up the ghosts Ghostbusters-style.Graphics: The best usage of the Gamecube's engine is in the lighting and shadow. Lightning strikes through windows provide perfect shadows as well as your flashlight shining the dark rooms. Everything else looks rather blah. Besides Luigi and the ghosts, the rooms looks almost unfinished and somewhat blurry in some cases.Music/Sound: Barely any music beside a slight reprise of the classic Mario dungeon theme. When you vacuum in a ghost, there's this irritating piano figure, it's literally one note repeated. As for voices, Professor Gadd talks in a faux Japanese almost as it sounds like it but way to short to be japanese, and by pressing B, Luigi cries out \"Mario?\". His health plays a role in how confident or scared he sounds.Gameplay: The control scheme for this is awkward. Shoulder L is for element firing, R is for the vacuum and the grey buttons are for your Game Boy Horror, which shows either your map or a scanning feature(almost similar to Metroid Prime's). To turn the flashlight on is A, directly beneath it is the right analog which determines where Luigi faces.The stumble at the finish line reference in my subject refers to the final boss. I won't spoil who it is or anything but I'll say what happens: you take on King Boo(this isn't really a spoiler) who's inside a big...thing. Anyways, to suck up King Boo you have to fire these big spiky rocks at the thing's mouth while it's attacking but he gets so close to you, the resulting explosion ends up damaging you. Once you hit him, King Boo flies out and you have to suck him in. He literally has 500 HP...compared to your 100. Not only that, while you're trying to suck him in, the thing is firing ice at you.This is an incredibly unfair fight. It's like the difficulty was evenly balanced throughout the game then bam, frustration alley. I'm no Johnny-come-lately newbie when it comes to gaming but I took well over 4 tries to beat the guy. Kids will be able to progress in the game with little hiccups here and there but that last boss will send them running for their big brother. But other than that, give it a try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Not quite as good as 1, but a great follow up to the game of the year","reviewText":"I've played every Halo game to date including Halo 1-3, Wars, ODST, and Reach. I would rank Halo 2 as 4th best after Halo, Halo Reach, and Halo 3. Still a great game that I would recommend to any fan of the first game or the series. The Master Chief's story is incredible.Gameplay: very similar to Halo, you fight the covenant and the flood in various locations, including a 2nd ring world and Earth. The difference in this game is that you alternate between the Master Chief and the Arbiter, an elite who was punished for the failure of the covenant to stop the humans from destroying the ring world in the first Halo game. New enemies include the brutes who are part of the covenant and later become the defenders of the covenant prophets. You can dual-wield certain weapons in the game, including smaller guns such as the plasma gun, needler, some rapid fires, etc. The AI Hottie, Cortana is still helping throughout the game, though her appearance is somewhat different from Halo 1.Story: continued from Halo 1, the covenant have located a 2nd ring world and are still trying to activate the weapon. Those idiots still don't realize it will kill all sentient life forms! As master chief, you try and stop the covenant from destroying earth and activating the Halo ring. As the Arbiter, you try and continue the fight against the humans, but soon learn about the ring's true meaning and then try and stop it from firing. The elites break away from the covenant and the new battle between the brutes and elites begin. The arbiter becomes an ally of Master Chief and they both try and stop the ring from firing.Multiplayer: You can play through the campaign with 2 players, but this game differs from Halo 1 by allowing you to battle out on multiplayer maps online. Something Halo 1 did not have. While certainly entertaining, I prefer the campaign mode.Overall: the game ending was a bit lame, and was actually not intended by Bungie. The game was rushed and you could feel it a little as certain points. This was because Bungie scrapped the first game engine they started with on Halo 2 and developed a new one, but it cost them the precious time they needed to polish the game to near perfection. They didn't want to delay the game, so it became what it is. Still a masterpiece but lacked in certain areas that could have used the extra time they didn't have.If you have never played Halo, pick up Halo 1 or the re-make in November 2011, and then pick up 2, 3, and Reach to see the full Halo story. Definitely worth owning.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00002STFD","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"An Unbalanced Game","reviewText":"For the past few months I'd been picking up old N64 games that I didn't get a chance to purchase during their initial release, and when I saw Shadows of the Empire I immediately grabbed it, being the big Star Wars fan that I am.Shadows was one of the launch games for the N64, and while it might have been a decent game in its day, maybe even a good game (I can't, however, believe it was ever considered a great game), it hasn't aged well at all. To compare, I also recently grabbed Super Mario 64, the original launch game, and still found plenty of charm left in that old cartridge.The graphics are a mixed bag. Our hero, Dash, is rendered rather nicely, with more polygons than one might expect. The levels, however, have ugly textures that will remind the player of early pseudo 3-D games like DOOM and Dark Forces. Hardly the graphical quality the N64 is capable of. Enemies such as the Stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details. However, the graphics on the flying missions and the speeder bike level are exceptional. With regards to sound, John Williams score has never failed before, and fortunately, the music combined with classic Star Wars sound effects is just what Star Wars fans want.Where the game really fails is the gameplay. Shadows tries to include many different modes of play, and not all of them work. The snow speeder level is a classic, as it inspired the game Rogue Squadron; the speeder bike chase is rather cool, as is the fight with Boba Fett. However, in other areas of the game, your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot. It's not much different from the Super Nintendo Star Wars games, and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long. Then there is the first-person levels, which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game. Though the game has multiple view modes, Dash is easiest to control in the first-person mode, but the player won't even see the tip of Dash's gun, as is customary with all shooters. There is no target reticle, making aiming irratic. The levels are too big and empty, and are too straightforward. It's a simple matter to walk from point A to point B, with few surprises. You'll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels, but unfortunately they're few and far in between.If you're a Star Wars fan, there's still enough here to warrant a purchase, but mostly it'll be for a piece of N64 Star Wars history. While I might have had different feelings about this game had I bought it at launch, I can't imagine feelings much more impressed by it. Shadows of the Empire is the most disappointing of all the N64 Star Wars games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2002"}

Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"A hilarious, irreverent and well-done tactical rpg","reviewText":"Most rpg games that I have played always have had a serious tone to them. This is understandable since most rpg games, especially those of the fantasy genre, involved defeating a Dark Lord of some sort and saving the world from destruction. This is not the case with ATLUS' Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Disgaea is one of the funniest and most irreverent game I have ever played.For starters, the main character in the game is a teenage demon by the name of Laharl whose sidekick Edna is a young demoness who seems to be constantly ridiculing Laharl and maybe even plotting behind his back. Laharl is clueless and behaves the way he thinks demon lords should behave, Edna and the rest of his courtiers barely give him his due respect and yet they still follow him for some reason. Weird and unusual cast of characters for an rpg.With Disgaea being an rpg in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle Tactics, there will be an inordinate amount of jobs you as a player can recruit to join your team. Jobs that can be recruited from can range from stereotypical fantasy fare like wizard, mage, cleric to more out there jobs like being a gunslinger of some type. There is even a a unit character one can recruit that is nothing but demonic servants in the shape of penguins that are called Prinnies and who always say &quot;dood!'.The levelling system in Disgaea is very extensive. If one had the time and inclination to do so, they can level up every character in their team into the 10000+ level. The same goes for the levels of their items. The good thing about Disgaea is that there are certain levels --- I will leave it up to the new players to figure out which --- that helps immensely in powerleveling a team member in the tens of thousands.The story for Disgaea is funny and doesn't make sense at times, but I think that may have been a plan of the developers from the beginning. But in the end, the story and its many subplots meld well together and everything starts to make sense. The dialogue ranges from downright funny, some sexual innuendoes thats either very mature or juvenile, and to very poignant and sad. I enjoy the option of keeping the voice-over in its original Japanese voices and using English subtitles. Or one can just go straigh to English voice-overs. More rpg games should make good use of this option. It'll save alot of gamers from having to listen to very bad English dubbing.The graphics is very simple and some may say dated for a PS2 game. It uses anime-style 2d animations unlike most rpgs that have gone the 3D-animation route. The animation looks very colorful and nice even if it's not 3D. The music ranges from operatic to J-pop in styles. Disgaea is really very simple when it comes to its visuals and audio. It could've been done better, but its a minor quibble when taken in context to the rest of the game.Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is a fun time of a game and one that doesn't ever get old or boring. For gamers who enjoy powerleveling their characters and who like to micromanage every detail of their gears and abilities, then this is a game for you. I hope ATLUS will continue with the success they had with this game and make an even better follow-up. I highly recommend.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2004"}

Cross Sale = Awesome.First I've played all the others on the PS2. Sly 2 being my favorite and still is.I think most people touched on the basics of what makes the game good/bad. but haven't addressed the Vita specific info, so i'll try here.Graphics:Looks great, for only being on a 5 inch screen, the game feels just right.  Frame rate can get a bit laggy in the later worlds though. but the colors and lightling in some of the set piece simply look stunning on the vita.Controls:For the basic jumping, running, climbing trees bit, the controls work great.  My two issues have to do with the touch screen stuff and motion controls.The touch screen is used to switch costume, weapon type, and use the binoculars.  For non emergency situation switching from costume to costume isn't that big of an issue.  But during boss battle i found it to be laggy and resulted in my death way too often. After a while i really wished i could change costume using a responsive button.For the motions controls they are used to solve puzzles, fire arrows, and a dance sequence with Carmelita.  The puzzles seemed to be actually made with the vita in mind and i bet feel better on the vita over the PS3 that said, when i have to twist and turn my vita and then my head to see what the hells going on i find it kind of annoying and jarring when i was just laying in my bed all comfortable and i have to sit up to roll a ball around.  As for firing arrows, i couldn't get it to work well enough to use it, and instead used the L stick.  Really wish there was an option to turn the motion control off and use the sticks instead.Oh and one gripe for anyone that uses inverted controls.  this game does give the option to change to inverted, which is awesome, but for some reason when I used the binoculars, gun, and arrows all the controls switched back to normal, which made me crazy during some of the more intense battles.Those are the two categories that i think would be vita specific, everything else should pretty much be same same. So here's just a list of the pros and cons of the game in general.Pros:*It's a true sly game.*10-15 hours of game play not including all the collectibles.*Sly, Bentley and Murray all control really well.*Some mini games are really fun.  often stolen from other games and modified for this one. Rocky Montage!!!*Costumes give it a good re-playability to find all the treasure stashed around.*Playing as one of the ancestors is really fun when the environment is truly tailored for them.  This isn't often the case though. Often you'll think to yourself, 'why am i not using Sly for this, it would be way easier.'Cons:*Annoying mini games.*Instant Deaths abound, which just feels cheap.*Mission heads are often no where near where the mission actually starts.  just seems like away to add game play time.*In the beginning the missions don't seem to be building to any grand heist like in the other games, and often don't, ending with a simple oops and boss battle.* Costume give you fun powers but can't be used in experimentation.  it would be fun to go around hitting bad guys with the jail bird costume's 'ball an chain.'That said everything good about Sly is back, good characters, fun worlds to explore, and random stuff to collect.  what is also back are a ton of mini games.

{"product_name":"B000035Y09","description":"Final Fantasy II, which was released in Japan (as Final Fantasy IV) in 1991 and in the U.S. in 2003, set the benchmark for the role-playing genre. Utilizing complex story development and deeper characterizations than previous games,Final Fantasy IItells the story of a malevolent emperor that has called on demonic monsters to take over the world. In the chaos that follows, thousands succumb to their evil attacks until four young, orphaned survivors take it upon themselves to stop the merciless rule and avenge the deaths of their parents.This Super Nintendo-platform reissue includes new cinematic movies, opening theme songs, event scenes (including updates of the original event sequences), enhanced graphics, improved sound quality, as well as new game-play modes, making the game accessible to beginners and veterans alike.","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"M-M-M-Meteo!","reviewText":"Seems like there's a score of different Final Fantasy games out there these days, but despite the grandeur of FF 7, the melodrama of FF8, or the outright eyecandy of FF10, there's really no beauty like that of a simple classic. If you find yourself surrounded by people who've been playing games for a while, and the subject of Final Fantasy comes up, you'll find that most probably veer towards the new ones, especially FF 7 and 10. But if, like me, you're asked which is your favorite and you reply \"Oh, I'll always love Final Fantasy II most of all\", you will get respectful nods from all directions. And why not?Final Fantasy II was a SNES game that came out in the beginning of the 90's, catering to the same crowd that was sucked into it's predecessor on the original NES. By this time RPG's were becoming more prevalent on Nintendos (owed almost entirely to the original Final Fantasy), old and new, and so Squaresoft threw this wonderful game on the US market. Unlike the first Final Fantasy this one had an actual plot, with characters that became an integral part of the story. New characters were introduced as the game played out, usually enticing you with answers to your characters' questions, but also leaving you with more questions. By the time you reached the last boss of the game you were really surprised at how much time you had put into the whole thing, and pleased with the payout.They never made an RPG game that gave the player the \"epic\" feel quite like the Final Fantasy games did. I bought Final Fantasy III for my nephew about 2 years ago for PS One, and it was like a real stroll down memory lane. I can't wait to add this one to the collection! :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2003"}

While the story is nothing new at all the gameplay and graphics more than make up for it.  This game came bundled with my PS3, so I figured it would be a dud that Sony just wanted to get rid of.  10 hours of gameplay later, as I was finishing up the game, I was wanting more.  I know the game is two years old now, but Uncharted looks AWESOME in HD format.  I was immediately glad that I owned a PS3 when I played this game because the graphics in Uncharted are amazing.  You can tell the developers spent a lot of time working out the little details, from the sun shining off water, to fluid movement of Drake.  It was a very fun game that I enjoyed thoroughly.  It did get a little tedious at times with its Tomb Raider-like qualities (the jumping, ledge-holding, vine-swinging was old hat and kind of boring).  But after playing the newest Tomb Raider game I appreciate Uncharted even more.  I would have liked more critters and animals to shoot; shooting the same thug over and over again became tiresome.A few improvements could be made for the upcoming Uncharted, but after playing Drake's Fortune I'm excited to see where they go next.

I played FFX three times so I was hoping I would be comfortable with this game right when I picked it up but I felt like I was playing something completely different. First of all, the music is down right horrid. Usually Square has these wonderful scores to go along with their games but this seems like it was taken right out of the disco era. It's horrible. The fact that they changed Yuna's character so much isn't pleasing either. She was an angelic woman in FFX and now she looks like a hooker who is also a BAD BAD BAD dancer. The battle system is bad also. I don't like the dress system. It's confusing and tedious. I would much rather have a bigger party and assign them each different roles as in FFX. The jumping system is another thing I could do without. Yuna can only jump in certain areas and it's difficult to tell exactly where those areas are. You just have to hold down the O button and hope she jumps somewhere. The camera system is also bad. Often times I can't see where I'm going. The graphics have been improved a bit and the voice acting is better this time and the vocals seem to be synched up to the lips better also. The best thing about this game is it continues where FFX left off and it manages to keep that magic going even if it's not as good as it could have been.Graphics: 5.0Control: 4.0Sound: 4.0Fun Factor: 4.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005043P","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for Sega Genesis, no case","reviewerName":"M. B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"4.5 stars - Part 1 of the biggest Sonic game ever...","reviewText":"Sonic The Hedgehog 3(1994). The third official Sonic game on the Genesis.February 2, 1994. \"Hedgehog Day\", as Sega so bluntly stated in the commercials promoting the next sequel of the series. Even Alex Trebeck used this bit of trivial information on an episode of Jeopardy once. Whatever all this means, the Sonic series had reached an all-time high with the major success of its classic sequel. If the first game introduced us to the next mascot in gaming, then Sonic 2 was the game that cemented Sega's reputation as a true 16-bit giant in the early 90s. Those were such great times, living in an age with two great systems, the Genesis and the SNES, which spawned so many 2D classics that are still enjoyed... err anyways, enough reminiscing. After the 2D zenith of Sonic 2, Sega promised fans that they would follow-up with what was to be the BIGGEST AND BEST Sonic game of the series. In the two year gap between official sequels, the Sega CD did churn out the much overlooked Sonic CD, a game which I hold in high regard, yet it unfortunately became forgotten once a Genesis sequel would emerge. The hype was as high as ever, and things were looking extremely promising for this massive sequel...However, in an effort to meet deadlines AND pack as much goodness into a Sonic game as possible, Sega was forced into dividing Sonic 3 in two separate parts: the game we all know today as Sonic 3, and also the rest of it packaged later on in the year into a special \"lock on\" cart known as Sonic & Knuckles. This aspect both pleased and angered some fans, though standing alone, Sonic 3 holds up extremely well. It has enough new features to keep the older fans happy, and anyone new to the series would find this game to be a great starting point. Besides, you can still play the \"full Sonic 3\" by popping this one on top of S&K;, so it's not like this scheme is avoided. Just separated like puzzle pieces, that's all. Here's the scoop on Sonic 3:PROS-YOU CAN MAKE TAILS FLY NOW! This is something I'm sure many fans complained about with Sonic 2, so now as the second controllable character, you actually have something to do. Plus, you can swim and lift Sonic up to otherwise unreachable areas out of his grasp. Pretty cool.-FANTASTIC GRAPHICAL UPGRADE. This means more scaling, more colors, and more fast paced action.-HUGE LEVELS TO EXPLORE. While there aren't high quantities of levels in Sonic 3 alone, the quality of them is astounding. They are so BIG and expansive that you can easily get lost in some of them, though there is always some sort of path to keep you on track. Each level is roughly 2.5 times the size of any stage in Sonic 2.-NICE VARIETY OF SHIELD POWERUPS. The standard blue shield was kinda getting boring, so Sega thought to vary it up with a bubble shield that lets you breathe underwater (and bounce!), a fire shield that does a scorch attack, and the electric shield which provides a double-jump in addition to attracting rings like a magnet. The \"insta-shield\" trick is also a noteworthy series staple.-MORE GREAT MUSIC. Sonic 2 is still king here, with Sonic CD and 1 right behind it, but Sonic 3 offers a bunch of memorable music. I particularly loved the Hydrocity Act 2, Marble Garden Act 1, and the Ice Cap and Launch Base themes.-And speaking of Ice Cap Zone, THIS IS THE BEST ZONE IN ANY SONIC GAME! Sega knew that all 3 of its previous games were missing an ice-themed stage, and what better way to introduce us than by having Sonic ride down a slope on a fast snowboard. Those were probably the greatest 20 seconds of any Sonic game.-GREAT SPECIAL STAGES. Unlike the time-based ones of the 3 previous games, Sonic 3's SS's offer a simple giant pseudo-3D sphere grid in which you must collect all the blue spheres and avoid the red ones. While the other games' stages seemed like you needed luck to win, these ones are based more on skill, which is a major plus. Also, these stages are much more accessible now in the game.-The BONUS STAGES offer a nice change from the seriousness of the SS's in that you don't have to win them, just collect powerups, etc.-NOW YOU FIGHT A BOSS AT THE END OF EVERY STAGE. None are too difficult, but offer enough of a challenge to keep things interesting.-Lastly, THE SAVE FEATURE IS NICE TO HAVE.CONS-VERY FEW ZONES. 6 to be exact. This is of course understandable given what I've explained above, but even if the stages are long, the game itself still feels brief.-YOU CAN EASILY TELL THAT SONIC 3 WAS MEANT TO BE LARGER. If the stage select menu didn't give it away, then remember all those \"unbreakable walls\" that you see every so often? Well maybe if another character...-2P MODE IS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT. Just run laps in very short zones. No playing through actual in-game levels or special stages like the ones in Sonic 2.-Big stages mean that THE TIMER IS A REAL PAIN IN THE ARSE for explorers.-Oh, and even though most of the music is great, the CARNIVAL NIGHT ZONE THEME DRIVES ME UP THE WALL. Trust me, it'll get very tedious after a few minutes.By itself, Sonic 3 holds up to be a very solid entry, but because it is clearly \"half\" a game, I'll only give it 4.5 stars. Do yourself a favor and get both halves and play the Sonic 3 & Knuckles adventure. It doesn't matter if you link the two Genesis carts or get it through Sonic Mega Collection. Either way, it's the best way to experience it. GOTTA JUICE!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2005"}

This game takes place in the old west.  The country side is experiencing a plague of the undead!  And you are the main character responsible for finding out what is going on and how you can save your family and restore sanity and health back to the country.Where to start.  The graphics are incredible.  Rockstar has it down.  Very detailed images to interact with.  The trees blow in the wind, dust gets kicked up when you ride your horse.  The weather changes over a period of time as you play.  From sunrise, to sunset.  Rainy, cloudy, clear or beautiful.  You don't know which.  It is amazing to me how the game does this.  And the changes are gradual also and unpredictable.  The only thing I would like to see is that they don't change as soon as they do.  I would like to spend more time in the day.This game has a lot more unpredictable side-games.  For example you'll be riding down a road and you'll hear someone screaming for help.  You pull over the road and there are zombies chasing a woman.  You can chose to ignore, or save her.  If you do save her, you get rewarded.  If you don't save her, well, she becomes a meal.  One time I used the wrong gun and blew them both away.  The outcome was not very positive, but the fact that you can come across these little episodes makes the game fun.The music and the sound effects are top-notch.  There's even a tumbleweed that blows across from time to time.Weapons are cool.  From a revolver, rifles, shotguns, torches, dynamite and many others.  My favorite is the blunderbuss which will literally disintegrate the zombie.  Leaving nothing but a stain.  The great thing is that when you kill a zombie with your rifle or pistol, you can \"loot\" the corpse and find undead items such as eyes, ribs, teeth, etc.  Then you these parts to build Blunderbuss ammo.  What a cool detail.Overall, I could go on about all that I have experienced, but, trust me, this game is incredible and you'll have no qualms about purchasing.  I highly recommend it IF you like zombies, shooting games and overall adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2011"}

The game's story mode is surprisingly gripping, and the boatload of unlockable content and extras is wonderful as well.  Though the game's online modes could be better, you won't be disappointed with Mortal Kombat in the least bit.

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks.

{"product_name":"B008CP6RWU","description":"","reviewerName":"Big Al \"Alan Rivire\"","summary":"A magical and spiritual journey","reviewText":"This review is on Journey.It is really hard to tell the genre of this game. It is unlike any video game I ever played. I like to call it spiritual adventure. The game involves the player in a journey from a desert to a mountain summit filled with light and ends with the player walking into the void, followed by a cutscene of a sparkling shooting star retracing the journey and returning to the very same spot where the journey begins. The story strongly hints at the endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth in eastern religions.The game is also fun. The player assumes the role of a cloaked figure with a magical scarf as she walks, runs, slides, and flies through various environments. The scarf is charged with magic every time she touches a cloth creature or the ground (in white cloak only) and the magic runs down as she flies. As she discovers glowing symbols along the way, the length of the scarf grows and hence enables her to stay airborne longer. In the final ascent to the summit, the player is challenged to stay airborne all the way by hitting the waving seaweed-like and jellyfish-like cloth creatures and the magical waterfalls.The multi-player mode can't be simpler. The player meets other players on the way and travels together. There is no competition. Players can choose to help each other by showing the way and the locations of glowing symbols and glyph sites, or by re-charging the magical scarf by touching or shouting at each other, or they can choose to ignore each other, just like real life. There is no spoken language in the game. Players communicate with each other and other cloth creatures with shouts and chirps of musical notes.The player is immersed in one of the best classical music score I have ever heard - inside or outside of video games. The music is composed by the famed American composer of film and video game scores Austin Wintory. His music score in Journey was nominated for a Grammy Award. Don't miss out on this fabulous and one of a kind video game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005THAX6K","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Terribly conflicted (3.5 stars ORIGINALLY - UPDATED to 1 stars and HATING IT at the end)","reviewText":"There is no mistaking it; Aliens:  Colonial Marines is a mess.  About 9 months ago, I witnessed a 20 minute demo of the game...and it looked good.  What happened in the interim is simply explained by a seemingly well-polished game upstaged by marketing and extra effort put into a demo.First of all, sound.  Yes, it's a strange place to start, but it's the thing that bothers me the most.  We first get a video summary from Corporal Hicks (from Aliens, of course) basically summarizing the survivors of the fated excursion to rescue colonists on LV426.  His voice is loaded with static and faint; very appropriate.  Then, you hear a typical pep talk from your CO...AND WHY AM I STILL LISTENING TO STATIC?!?  HE'S IN FRONT OF ME FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!  Then, however, the sound rights itself...sort of.  The musical score is underwhelming and sounds like it's coming from my bedroom with the door closed.  The gunfire (while authentically sounding like the movie) sounds like it was recorded from the original VHS soundtrack as opposed to the remastered sound that you hear on the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  Sound is just extremely unbalanced throughout and it's distracting.  I don't fault my sound system - I've been pretty happy with my Pioneer Elite and just listening to the thundering soundtrack on Inception was enough to put my fears to ease that my sound system was NOT the cause.The good.  I enjoy the gameplay immensely.  It's not frightening, but it's fun.  IGN and other game reviewers have noted that the AI blindly charges you.  Well...yes and no.  Sometimes Aliens just run right at me but I have found areas where I find them scrambling across walls and ceilings to avoid my fire.  It's not entirely accurate that the AI is completely mindless.  The guns themselves range quite a bit in variety and follows an old Doom style sort of inventory management (of course I can carry 9 guns!!!).  You'll find that some weapons are worthless (powerful, but with a very low rate of fire) whilst others, like Hicks' famed shotgun which shows up as one of several \"legendary\" weapons, are more useful than their standard variants and finding them is half the reward of playing.The not so good:  story.  I was wondering how Aliens:  Colonial Marines was going to tie into the sequel.  The Sulaco was spotted over Fury 161 (a nod to Alien 3) and then somehow reappears over LV426.  How does this happen, asks one inquisitive soldier??  Well, heck, we don't know but we don't care, so let's start the story shall we?  Oh, and there are Weyland-Yutani mercenaries on the ship for some reason!  By the way...remember that atmosphere-processing plant that went thermo-nuclear in a cloud supposedly the \"size of Nebraska?\"  Well, make that a family living room in Nebraska since one of the walls in Operations at Hadley's Hope suffered massive damage...and it might have knocked over a chair or two.  It certainly didn't take out Hadley's Hope.  There are certain gameplay elements that are frustrating as well.  I held my breath when I jumped into the claw-armed loader...and expelled it in disappointment.  The controls for it are clunky and I feel like I'm taking rapid baby-steps in the dang thing as opposed to the more powerful, slow lumbering walks that I'm used to seeing in the movie.  They simply got it WRONG.Graphically, it's sad.  Very, very sad.  When you look at games like Uncharted or Dead Space 3 (running at 1080p!) and marvel at how something could look so beautiful without tearing or framerate hiccups, one has to wonder how something that looks about as advanced as Doom 3 could tear and suffere framerate hiccups like this game does.  I don't judge a book entirely by its cover, mind you, but this is bordering on the \"frustratingly distracting\" when it happens.  It's also inconsistent - some areas look decent and then you wonder where that polish went in the next area.  Sadder still is that the PC game appears to have received the best treatment while the console ports seem to be a poorly developed afterthought.  Again, keeping in mind how good Uncharted and Dead Space 3 look...why oh why couldn't they have done a better job?But why do I love it so much?  It truly boils down to this - nostalgia.  This is the Aliens game I WISHED had come out as a movie game back in the late 80's...and the gameplay isn't too bad.  In 2013, however, it is a letdown simply because it could have been capable of so much more.  At $29 or less, I would say that it's worth a spin.  At full price, however, this is an insult.  Even though it may have been outsourced, Gearbox should NOT have slapped their name on this; this is not the quality of game that I would want my company name saddled with on my resume.UPDATE------I completed the game as I progressively became more and more disenchanted with it.  In the end, I had to downgrade the score overall since the game just kept getting WORSE.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThe final \"boss fight\" (and I use the term \"fight\" very, very loosely) involves the Queen (surprise).  But rather than it being a drawn out slug-fest, she is apparently immune to all forms of weaponry (hell, even \"10mm rounds...explosive tips, caseless\" don't really matter, right?).  So what does this final fight involve?  Well, it involves moving around a U-shaped room with conveniently placed (allegedly strewn wreckage caused by the Marine's air transport slamming into the side of a Weyland-Yutani ship to escape LV-426) cargo containers with openings that allow you to hit 4 switches to prep a \"cargo launcher.\"  Before you start into a series of laughing fits, think about this:  1) why would anyone create a cargo system that requires you to go to 4 rather inconveniently placed switches for such a system and...well, let me get to 2) in a second.  So once the launcher is prepped, you have to \"lure\" the Queen in front of the launcher so you can hit the switch.  Now I get to 2).  Who designs a cargo launcher that apparently looks like it was designed to jettison something as heavy as about 4 or 5 semis through the hold at over 100 mph at the door opening?!?  Yes, you hit the Queen with this monstrosity and then you're greeted with someone who looks like Bishop but it's actually Weyland himself...or is it?!?  This insipidly stupid ending treats us to the Bishop with the Marines plugging into the dead android imposter with our main character, Winter, saying, \"Did we get anything Bishop?  We really need a win here?\"  \"We got everything.\"  Roll credits.  WHAT?!?!??!??In addition to a stupid ending, we are treated during the course of the story to an attempt to save one of your squadmate's life because she has an Alien in her...but we knew where this was going.  Ultimately, I think that I was supposed to shed a tear, but I found myself groaning inwardly, \"Get on with it\" as the cutscene played out.As far as the story, the veering off from story canon does actually get worse.  We are treated with Corporal Hicks...alive!  But Hicks, weren't you found dead in the escape unit on Fury?  \"Well, that's a longer story.\"  THAT'S THE EXPLANATION WE GET?  For a game that barely played out at over 7 hours, you don't have time to explain that serious piece of tripe?!?On a completely unrelated note, it's weird that the cutscenes...which should be fully rendered movies, mind you...actually exhibit a great deal of framerate stutter and tearing than the actual gameplay itself.  HUH?The novelty of playing in the Aliens universe with the weaponry that fascinated me when I was 13 expels itself during the course of this slog-fest and I honestly wish that I could sue Gearbox for fooling us with the demo video that was presented last summer.  What was shown in that demo versus the final product are NIGHT AND DAY.Pass this journey.  If you're a die-hard, wait until it hits the $19.99 bin of disappointment.  Gearbox will NEVER get a pre-ordered red cent out of me ever again, even it they beat the only drum that they could possibly beat in terms of Borderlands 3.

It's not perfect, but when compared to the earlier Treyarch releases it is much better and with luck will keep the series moving in a direction fans love. I have this game for the PC and the XBox 360 and I've not only enjoyed both, I've been impressed with how well the graphics look on my desktop:  the XBox 360 version renders remarkably well but it can't touch the quality of my desktop PC.What I love about the single-player campaign is that the story is intricate and contains some surprising twists to it--and what seals the deal is the history behind it. The story is set during the Vietnam War and also touches on the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs incident. There are a couple of things depicted in the game that aren't quite accurate, but it's been enjoyable getting details from Vietnam veterans I know (and from the Internet). It's still a very plausible campaign and there is enough variety in each level and its goals that you don't feel like you're being handed a map and a paltry excuse to shoot it up from one end to the other.When it comes to multiplayer, on the PC it can be a huge disappointment.  If you have friends you can group with on a closed map, you're in for a great time--otherwise, my experiences trying random pick-up maps left me worn out by all the cheating.  This isn't a rant about people who move faster; I was running across players who could pull the trigger anywhere on the map and you automatically die of a headshot, over and over, as their stats climb the boards.  On the PC I went to bot-matches and saved multiplayer for the more locked-down XBox 360 platform. I really enjoy the way mutliplayer feels though: it's not just the fact that the technology is fairly accurate to the times, it's that even without Modern Warfare styled gadgets you can get a lot of tactical fun out of running and gunning across the maps. We still have airdropped care packages and we still have the occasional ability to light up the map with a radar sweep that tags enemies with red dots.So the only thing really keeping Black Ops from a 5-star rating are some minor cons. Like with every shooter, you'll have moments where your feet get stuck or you can't move because you can't see the treestump next to your ankle that's blocking you. I've learned to forgive those moments because they happen in any game. With Treyarch's \"World at War\" there were times that the enemies seemed to be willing to spawn forever if you didn't move to tag the appropriate hotspot on the map. This happens a few times in Black Ops and it can lead to some real Groundhog Day style moments. The other con that I'm hoping goes away in future Call of Duty games is that there will be times a checkpoint triggers at the worst possible moment--and if you die, you respawn into a bad situation that may take you a dozen revives to get past. I only had this happen a couple of times, but it left me thinking, \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" Frustrating, and sometimes it causes you to deliberately have to be foolhardy and rush in on a bad situation knowing you'll take a hit or two, because if you don't you'll be back to a bad respawn point. I'd rather push forward acting as if bullets are a bad thing that I can't just brush off by hiding for 10 seconds. It can get silly when some of the enemy AI are foolish enough to step out in front of you or stand next to cover, but at higher difficulties this happens less.Overall, if you like the Call of Duty series, this is a great entry into new territory. It's got an excellent storyline and while multiplayer is difficult without a closed group, both it and single player are loads of fun.TIP:  some people were having huge performance problems with this game (and may be still!)  There is a feature called 'Shader Warming' that will pre-cache shader graphics separately.  I enabled this setting, but some have reported that disabling Shader Warming helps them get better performance and stability.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

It isn't that TS2 isn't uniqute, because it is, and it's actually pretty cool going through time and venturing into all those far and away lands.  The real problem here is, well, the game is just too damn hard to enjoy.  This coming from someone who has beaten Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Solid on its hardest levels.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

This is not my first rodeo -- I have played just about every shooter out there. The saddest part of this is that I totally LOVED playing Far Cry 1 -- one of my favorite shooters ever. This sequel is awful! I played this game for about three hours -- plenty of time to get the feel and determine if its good or not. Most of the time I spent driving around -- or looking for a vehicle (or repairing a vehicle). When I did finally get to a fight, it was hard to see anyone in the weeds and I had to shoot someone a dozen times, unjam the gun, die, then drive forever to get back to that same location! Ugh!Yes, the graphics are well done, but eventually you have to look past the graphics and actually play the game. How can folks be rating this game a 5? Who, developers and their families?

Pikmin was an obvious choice. I played the original back in the game cube days, so I knew what I was in for.I must say, for a ten year old game, it holds up. The new play controls are very much intuitive,  one would think the game was designed for the wii from the start. The graphics look old, they come from the gamecube of course, and other than resizing the display to fit a 16x9 screen without stretching, no improvements there have been made. Given the cartoony style of the game however, there's nothing really wrong with that, although some anti-aliasing would've been nice.This game is challenging & compelling, yet completely appropriate for children of any age and therefore makes an excellent gift to a young child.

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Absolutely Incredible!!!","reviewText":"First off let me say I'm a huge fan of the Call of Duty series, I have literally played 6000+ games of CoD:MW.  I have been excited since the announcement of Modern Warfare 2, and apparently with good reason!I installed Modern Warfare 2 to my HDD and started it up.  Everything from the menus to the ambient sounds have been changed and enhanced...now of course these are just small details, but worth noting after you've been used to CoD:MW for so long.  I played a few hours of campaign, and its nothing short of incredible.  The visuals and sounds are razor sharp and make it hard to keep your eye on the prize.I found myself venturing off to look at level details and textures, but hey that's all part of getting a new game right?  I don't wanna ruin any of the story details but let me tell you, it doesn't disappoint.  And one note to parents: this game really isn't for kids under 16 in my opinion, its got some pretty brutal scenes which were even hard to swallow for me sometimes.Multiplayer is just as addicting as Modern Warfare and the levels in my opinion are a huge step up!  Levels like high-rise and estate are just fantastic, great size and proportion whether you enjoy sniping or full out run and gun each level has something for you.  I didn't get to spend much time with the online portion because of work but the digging around I did do was mind blowing!  The amount of perks, kill streaks, death streaks, and equipment is night and day with the previous Modern Warfare.  Just get ready to mess around with those configurations because their are tons of possible combination's.Anybody who's seen any Youtube videos or TV commercials knows this game is one of the best looking out right now, so I'm gonna let your eyes tell your brain how crisp and detailed the visuals are!  I am however gonna mention the audio, I'm playing with a 7.1 setup and the sound is hands down the best I've ever heard in a video game.  The little things that catch your ear, just wow you.  You hear crickets, flies, florescent light ballasts humming, guns reloading way off in the distance, seriously the amount of audio detail just surrounds you!The only problem I found with this game so far is trying to put the controller down, I literally kept saying \"okay one more game\", \"I think I'm gonna check out this perk then I'm done\"...this went on for well over 3 hours.  I would suggest anybody with a 360, PS3, or PC pick this game up, you aren't complete without it!*Update*  Just a quick update here and since Amazon wont let me change my stars just take my original 5 and multiply by 100!  Spec Ops mode is incredible!  2 player \"co-op\" game play that gives me back the double team game type I missed from Halo 2&3 and the action and excitement that far rivals Horde Mode (Gears of War 2) and Terrorist Hunt (Rainbow Six: Vegas 1&2).  Playing these scenarios over and over again is well worth the price of admission alone!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"My favorite among the GTA series","reviewText":"Pretty deep, especially for a videogame.I don't want to tell any spoilers, so here's the gist. You play as Niko Bellic, a veteran soldier from the genocidal war in Kosovo. While fighting in the war, Niko, his cousin, and their platoon mates are betrayed by one of their members, leaving only four soldiers alive. Niko's cousin Roman goes to the US to seek a better life following the war, but ends up becoming a cokehead with a lot of gambling debts. He entices Niko to come to the US with tales of the American Dream, but when Niko arrives, he discovers the truth about his cousin's activities.Niko has only two reasons to come to the states... to start over, and to find the remaining two soldiers from his platoon: Darko and Florian. There are no riches or comfortable accommodations for Niko, only the hunt for the betrayer.Niko rampages through the streets earning money for himself and his brother. All the while, he meets a few characters along the way and tries to cope with his past.In GTA3, you were a nobody. In GTA Vice, you were a tool. In GTA San Andreas, you are caught up in the worst storyline ever. In GTA LCS, you were Tony C. In GTA IV, you are a real, original character.Not only is your character genuine, he is also one hard-boiled mofo. His soldier background is present in the gunplay of the game. Niko can duck behind walls, blindfire, take cover, dive across gaps for cover, the whole shabang. Aiming is much improved from past GTA games. You can screw people up pretty badly if you want. Grenade tossing is spot on. The AI isn't too dumb either.Perhaps the most notable upgrade is with driving. You have a little GPS locater in your car and you can set your own waypoints. You can also take taxis to all marked locations and waypoints, very nice. The radio stations are brilliant as always. Car selection is sweet. Just be careful while driving...lots of terrible crap can happen to you. Sudden stops will send you sailing out of the windshield, and if your car begins billowing even a little bit of smoke, it will blow up eventually with wear. Lucky for us players, cars in GTA4 take a pretty long time to blow up once they catch fire. Just dive out of the car if it does.Finally, the graphics. The game is beautiful. The Liberty City skyline has never looked so alive. Take some time out to look around from a high perch or while driving across a bridge. You will be pleased with what you see.  I was actually able to use this to demonstrate the next generation of urban environmental modeling.  Yeah it looks great.I would have liked to see the same variety of available vehicles that was present in GTA San Andreas.  This was the one downgrade that bothered me about the game.  But the improvements in gameplay more than repaid for that change.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2008"}

I have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it. Now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down. Hell I love online gaming but 40 some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much. The adapter is fine within itself. The problem I have with it, is just the online capabilities. Now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your PS2 (...)takes way to much time. Another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel. In order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process. It is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult process.Another problem with this product is the capabilities with the games. First of the games are very limited...From that I mean the choice in which one has to play from. Eventually I know more games will come out...But eventually PS3 will come out won't it? Nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass!! Playing from several of my friends house and my own the lagging and time it takes to enter a game is extensive and overstrenuius. There are pleanty more things wrong with this including hidden fees with cables (not included in package) the games and routers (Which I needed).

Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Good production quality- but it's just not really fun","reviewText":"I really thought this game was going to be fun. It does almost everything right technically, but for some reason it just isn't fun. Perhaps it's because I've played far too many games of this sort. Whereas Jedi Knight and Jedi Outcast made you feel like a Jedi Knight- this game just doesn't make you feel like a Bounty Hunter. The only part of the game I felt like I was a bounty hunter was when I was chasing my bounty through the streets of Coruscant. But that was far too brief and once you've caught your bounty (ie tagged it) it just disappears and you are credited for the catch. This is the only time I have seen bounty actually try and flee. For most of the game, your bounty just stands there. The credits that you are awarded for catching your bounty are used to unlock different extras in the game (like an online comic book). I had hoped that the credits could be used to buy new weapons- but nope.This game would have been much better if it were designed more like Tenchu. Instead this game feels like Obiwan for the XBOX.Pros:- decent back story- explains how Jango got his ship and his involvement with Tyranus.- good graphics quality- good cutscenes - by ILM- good sound design - by Skywalker sound- good user interface except for the camera. Other reviewers complain about the difficulty in switching between scanner and weapon. It's actually very simple- click UP ARROW to activate scanner; RIGHT ARROW twice to go to pistols from scanner. You'll be doing this a lot.- Jango gets all the gadgets you'd expect for Jango- Jet pack is his best feature- you will depend on it like Force Jump in Jedi Outcast.- Frame rate is very high- AI seems to be better than Jedi Outcast.Cons:- Very very repetitive- Camera has a mind of its own at times and is difficult to override to see crucial elements of the game- like your character when it is trying hard not to step off a ledge.- Camera tends to swing by itself to create a \"good\" view. This makes you very motion-sick very quickly. This is the first PS2 game that has made me motion sick with the wild camera swings.- The only stealth component is that you can use your scanner to telescope out to find your victims, then shoot him/her from a long ways off. The stealth aspect doesn't really make the game more fun- like it does in Tenchu.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2002"}

The conclusion of the game is so poorly directed I didn't even realize I was watching the game come to a close. [-1 star]3. Arkham City is literally LITTERED with Riddler trophies/riddles.  It feels absolutely contrived and forced, as if they knew they did not have enough story content and tried to pump it full of inane extras.4. Side quests are at best boring, and at worst unbelievably tedious (I'm lookin' at you augmented reality training).5. The Arkham City mechanics are stretched too far.  The mechanics were not designed for sandbox gameplay, and it is painfully clear to the player: objectives are impossible to find, Batman clumsily fumbles around the landscape, and I've fallen in far too many water sources.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2012"}

I have played the entire Metal Gear Solid series, sat through most of the Resident Evil series. I've played the entire Half Life series, and the Portal series as well. I love video games. The thing is, I only have a PlayStation 3. So, I've missed out on some great series because I can only justify purchasing one expensive console. So, I've watched from the side-line as my friends enjoyed Halo, and Gears of War, as well as Alan Wake. But the thing that hurt the most was Mass Effect, I was totally intrigued by the deep story line and the intricate choice system.In a turn of events that rarely happens in the video game world, Mass Effect was released on the PS3 this year. And, holy hell was the wait worth it. Mass Effect has to be one of the most exciting and entertaining games I have ever played. The story is one of the best stories written across any medium. I passed and played through the original Mass Effect in about 3 days, logging nearly 30 hours, and receiving the completionist trophy. Needless to say, I had little to no life for those 3 days. It was fantastic way to unwind after a particularly tough semester in my university. I am now currently playing Mass Effect 2, and it is even better than the first. The graphical jump was impressive, and the modifications to the equipment and battle system are fantastic.I love these games, and I cannot wait to play Mass Effect 3.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

All 3 games are amazing in their own ways. ME1 has the best story, with twists and turns that will keep you playing past midnight, it is also the most RPG-ish of the three, giving you incredible amount of customizations. On the downside, the game is the most outdated in the visuals department, and the combat while fun is the weakest in the series.ME2 is easily my favorite in the series, it struck a great balance between the RPG elements and shooting, it offers the BEST characterization of any video game ever, I got to know and love every single member of my squad , the story is weaker than the first mainly because it feels like a &#34;side-story&#34; but the great characters more than make up for it. The combat is amazing, a huge improvement over ME1. The graphics are great as well. The replay value is incredible as well.ME3 , the biggest problem here is the lack of interesting characters, it is the complete opposite of ME2. Sadly I could not just care about any of the newly introduced characters or even the old ones. The main story is good, it is the most epic and finishes what ME1  started, the ending is OK but could have been a lot better. The combat is very similar almost identical to ME2 which is a good things. Overall it's the weakest entry but the series on a whole is by far the most fun I have had playing video games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

Cool.","reviewText":"Where to start with Dark Cloud?Firstoff It's available for eight  dollars  at most local gamestops in my area(Tax included) so try there first. Sure it's used but you can save a load of cash that way.The Rating.The descriptors are violence and comic mischief but I wonder if the ESRB missed a couple of thousand issues. Though they are not spoken the words \"Helluva\" and  the \"D\" word  appear in dialogue enough times to notice. The fortune teller  tells your fortune by leaping ontop of the main characters head and  grinding on it before screaming \"Pumpkin panty fourtune telling! here we go!!. No exaggeration. Luckily there are only a few  things she can tell you.  It isn't to graphic but considering the implications I think they  should've added language and ....something else as a descriptor.PlotAn ancient evil genie has been brought back to life via some bizzare dance. A human quickly steps forth and deems himself it's master on the grounds that he brought it back to life. The genie agrees before realizing it hasn't  eaten in years and swallowing a nearby human whole. Your character (Whom you get to name with the default being \"Toan\") Is having a celelbration  in his village  when the dark genie attacks, seemingly destroying everything and everyone. You are rescued by the Fairy King. He tells you that he rescued everyone by sealing them inside \"Alta\"  which are basically metal balls.He gives your character a special glove so he can wander the world, find the pieces of erach destroyed place and rebuild them. Ebbventually you'll have to defeat the dark genie with help from the friends you meet along the way.GraphicsThis game tries a little hard to mimic Legend of Zelda minus flexible limbs or even slightly realistic swordplay.When you attack your character literally just swings the weapon side to side. That's it.Weapons.Guess what? THEY'RE BREAKABLE. IF YOU DON'T CONSTANTLY REPAIR YOUR WEAPON IT WILL BREAK AND DISAPPEAR. The only exception is your very first. a dinky little dagger that  hardly does any damage. The fairy king \"Blessed\" this one so it can only break. Not break and disappear. You can also build them up to be really strong and cool looking.  There are a numbver of  different kins  you can discover. You'll also find glowing crystals called attatchments. These are very imprortant. Only by leveling up your weapon via attatchmens can they be built up. It's worth the work  but breakable weapons are  stupid to me especially with bosses to fight.AlliesIMPORTANT.In this game you will meet and get to name your allies. Just like you they have HP breakable weapons etc.  No big deal right? I mean you're obviously the star and you're the only one who can collect alta so you don't need to worry about whether they're in top form right? DEAD WRONG. You must, must, must , must, must level up the others. There are boss battles where the main character is completely USELESS. even in the very first you literally CANNOT win without help from your ally. So treat them like your main. It's been the case in every boss battle I've fought so far. Your allies are just as required as your main. It makes the game stand out and I found it to be both agonizing and awesome. when you meet flying monsters use the ally best suited for the job. it will pay off.Enemies  and BossesThe monsters often have pathetic names and cliche designs with the exception of the triceratops with a  huge spiked club.there are skeleton guards  and  monsters named after the days of the week. so you won't be Lookin' forward to the weeekend!Friday is just like the song annoying and hard to kill.First two  bosses are easy(again with help) but HEADS UP! for the third your main is useless so  when you get your first  three  allies  focus on leveling up their fire abilities and attack power via attatchments. You'll see why. Just do it. it is absolutely essential unkless you've got about four or five hours to spare. (I speak from experience.) again the fact you have to use the allies makes it unique.Biggest Con.Your Lock on does little more than make the camera go wild. Literally. It's so frustrating. It rarely ever works or shows you the approaching enemies. It's terrible.Overall the game introduces new concepts and stands out  because it makes sure every person has  an equal role  in the defeat of enemies.  Typical fantasy adventure with a cou[ple of issues. Ity isn't for kids. too complex and... the fortunetelling... ugggh so its definitely a teen game. If it were anything too bad I'd have returned the game or thrown it away but I'm still playing. I will update this review once I finish. right now it's simply \"Ok.\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}

I had high hopes for The Conduit - that it would be an outstanding shooter on the Wii that could compete with the heavy-hitting shooters on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Turns out this is not the case and The Conduit sinks to the level of just being a good shooter \"for a Wii game\".It's not the graphics that are the problem. I like to think that I don't let graphics influence my acceptance of a game too much (unless there are issues that seriously detract or distract from the quality or playability of the game). The graphics in The Conduit are actually rather well done, especially on the Wii's relatively limited hardware.The gameplay isn't all that bad either. It's a reasonably fun shooter, the controls handle well, and there are some interesting mechanics involving a device called the ASE, which allow the player to see hidden switches and even hidden threats like mines or cloaked enemies.It's the story. Ultimately, The Conduit boils down to being simply a \"generic alien shooter\". Aliens are invading, you're humanity's only hope, blah, blah. The Conduit attempts to put it's own spin on the story but really we've all seen and played this story countless times before in other games and movies. I just got so bored with the story I found it very difficult to continue and finish the game - I had very little motivation to do so because the plot was not engaging me or pushing me to play on.Being a shooter on the Wii, whether it's fair or not, requires something special to break free of the \"good-for-a-Wii-game\" stigma and truly compete with the heavy-hitters (like Call of Duty) in the inundated shooter market. The Conduit falls short. In my opinion, the Wii hardware limits The Conduit's ability to compete on a technical level by default. All that The Conduit has left to stand out with is it's story and art design, and I found that neither were original or engaging enough to make the game truly stand out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"David Allen \"Trust999\"","summary":"Really Great Job!! Excellent Game.","reviewText":"I've just completed the game, and I have to say, I was impressed. I'm an older gamer used to playing PC based games and not at all very good with a console controller, too many buttons. I've played most of the Tomb Raider series over the years, and have found them to be fairly interesting and not overly hard to play. There are many players out there that like their games to be exceedingly hard. I am not one of them. I like a challenge, but I want to enjoy playing, not become frustrated.At first I was apprehensive about buying this game. There was a lot of press out there about how the game was completely redesigned and game play was changed. This brought visions of multi-stick character control, which I loath with a passion. There is nothing more unnatural and confusing than to have to control your character with two different sticks while trying to battle, run, jump, aim, shoot etc., with the other half dozen buttons on the control. Sadly, a lot of games were going there, and I will not buy them, period. I was going to wait until I could borrow or copy or get a used copy cheap so it didn't matter and I could toss it or sell it back to Game Stop if the control schema had indeed been changed. I ended up getting a copy for Christmas from my wife. You cannot be a freebie!I was pleasantly surprised to find that the developers wisely kept the character control to one stick. I also found that use of the available buttons was kept to a reasonable minimum while still allowing for awesome game play. In a nutshell, you control Laura with the left stick, right stick pans your view when standing if needed. Left trigger causes Laura to draw her weapon. Right stick is used for aiming, and Right trigger is used to fire. On rare occasion you will use the Right shoulder button to perform special weapon options such as launching a grenade with the equipped rifle, of firing rope arrows. The X-Box letter button pad is also pretty simple with B for doing a dodge, X being interact, and Y being your Melee button. The A button is used for menu selection. I thankfully did not encounter any part of the game where I was using more than three control buttons or sticks at the same time. Good for my old brain and slower old hands. I did find the aiming to be a bit of a chore until I got more used to it. This was not much of an issue after I upgraded my skills and enabled the ability to draw and auto lock onto most targets. All I needed to do was spot an enemy, press the Left toggle to draw and the game would automatically place the reticule on the enemy in red, press fire, done. For multiple enemies, press Left toggle, fire, release Left toggle, press Left toggle again to get on to the next enemy, fire, repeat. This did not work in Boss Fights, and for some hunting.This Tome Raider is a reimagining of the series that the franchise thought was getting tired and stale. I didn't think so, but ok. The designers took us back to when Laura was an innocent young woman with no skills what so ever. She is on a research ship going to an island to research the mysterious goings on there and interview the inhabitants. Little did she know this trip was going to be the adventure of her life. A raging storm engulfs the ship, tosses it about the sea and it crashes on the rocky shoals of this very mysterious island. Most of her crew mates and friends survive, but they are across the beach from each other, and Laura cannot get to them directly. And so her adventure begins.There are multiple difficulty levels built into the game to appease both types of players, those lat love impossible hard game play and those like me who prefer a more enjoyable winnable game. The first few chapters are learning experiences. You have nothing when you begin except your wits. Laura discovers that inhabitants of the island are not friendly, and is soon captured and strung up in a net. From that point on you start earning XP (Experience Points), and eventually weapons, and Skill upgrades. All of these are important for successful completion of the game. You'll learn how to perform actions and eventually pick up a basic bow with arrows. From there you will learn more skills, obtain more weapons, and better versions of weapons. Ammo is scattered about, and may require some climbing to get to. Activities earn you XP. Finding food in the form of Bushes, and Food Crates will gain you XP. Cracking open salvage crates gains you XP. Sometimes you have to do things to get at the Salvage Crates like set them on fire. Each thing you do successfully gains you XP. You will also be given missions, once these are complete you also earn XP. Most levels also contain challenges. You may have to find and destroy flags or symbols to gain an achievement and win XP. When you have enough XP you can upgrade your weapons at any camp which are located in almost all levels. Some camps allow you to travel back to camps you've already visited once you reach a certain point in the game.There are puzzles in the game, but not nearly as many as in the older games where just about every move was some sort of puzzle. There are also various Tombs in various levels. These can be entered and pillaged after you solve a fairly easy puzzle. You will also have a special ability after your first Skills upgrade, Hunters Sense. This is enabled by pressing the left shoulder button while standing. The best way to describe it is it makes your surroundings look like a photo negative, and important things are highlighted so you can pick them out very easy. Things such as animals you can hunt will glow, salvage crates will glow, and enemies will glow.Gameplay I felt was fairly straight forward and easy to learn and do. A little practice and you should be set with most of the maneuvers. You'll quickly get used to selecting your weapons which is done by the left control pad. Up is Arrows, Down is Pistol, Left is Shotgun, and Right is Rifle. If course you'll have to earn the weapons, but very early you will have the bow to start. Laura only has one pistol in the game up until the very end where she gets her second pistol. Ammo you can carry is limited, but you can upgrade the magazines as you upgrade your weapons. Control of Laura was very well done. Extremely few miscues where she would not do what you expected. Almost all of those were not fatal. Save points are reasonable, and seem frequent. There are plenty of prompts in the easier game play settings. Well placed and they stay long enough for you to actually see what flashed up. The Melee worked very well, and is a fun aspect of doing battle with Laura, as well as the stealth kill.The story is believable, and the levels flow well into one another along the story line. Art and scene work was excellent, although there were some areas that were way too dark and you could not see the enemies. This was early on when your in the forest and a pack of wolves comes at you. I could not see them to aim and shoot, and they mauled me many times before I got through. Then as you are just beginning to get into the enemy stronghold, your in a dark room with an open area above where you had to take them out and you could not see them. Things are happening fast in these areas, and using the Hunters Sense will get you killed. There are two action escape sequences in the game. The first one is the hardest part of the whole game. You are required to parachute down off the mountain. You are flying on a parachute and have to steer left and right to avoid trees or you get impaled. The controls were very weak in this sequence and at some points you had to go hard right to hard left then hard right and the controls just were not there. The second sequence plays much better and its more of a timing thing for you to make it safely.There are two small boss fights, and one big one. None of them are overly difficult, just figure out what to do, watch for button push prompts and mash away, you'll be done in no time. One small boss fight allows Laura to get a special zip line tool, and another small boss fight gets Laura her signature second pistol. The big boss fight just gets you the satisfaction of kicking his butt!Overall I liked this game a lot. The key, as it is with any game, is to learn the game play, how to control your character, upgrade your skills, and your weapons to ensure your game gets easier near the end when enemies are more powerful and more plentiful. It helps a lot that the designers did an excellent job of game character control, art work, story line and all other aspects of the game. I highly recommend this game for those who want an good adventure, with some scary parts, some tense parts, some climbing, some tomb raiding, some puzzle solving, and some exploring with a few intense battles and fights tossed in once in a while. In the end Laura is a true survivor, heroine, and a matured young woman ready to take on the world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}

That's it. That's the con.The build quality of this thing is good - Sony could have put slightly better cameras in here, but I understand that they're trying to make this thing both affordable and long lasting. There are two lenses here, which means future connectivity with 3D content, and depth perception for applications that will use it.At this point, the primary reason for buying one of these is to stream your gameplay. You can either stream full screen, which will put your face in the top right corner (right on top of any HUD elements or gameplay) - which will make you unable to read any messages viewers may toss your way. Or you can crop the gameplay down to about 80% of the TV. The remaining 20% are for messages from Twitchtv viewers and your own face on the camera.At the moment, hundreds of thousands of players are streaming. You're going to need a VERY GOOD REASON for people to watch your stream instead of the other hundreds of thousands out there (This number is increasing. There may be more than a million streams by the 1 year anniversary of the ps4). Are you famous? Are you one of the best players in the world? If the answer is no to either of these - chances are not a lot of people are going to be watching you play. If you have an ego to sustain - well, just remember to wear some clothes - in the extremely rare event that someone actually does drop in to view your stream.Now, streaming aside, there are several other reasons to use this device:1. Voice commands. Not sure why you would rather say &#34;Show the world map&#34; rather than click the R3 joystick, but you have the option. Maybe some people want to play games with 1 hand?2. In game communication - theoretically, you could run a video feed with people you are playing against or cooperatively. This would be awesome.3. Skype/General communication. Also fantastic. It may be possible in the future (if not already) to communicate using a 3d camera. This would also be awesomeAs of now, many of the features/usability are very limited. I would wait until a future firmware upgrade to get more functionality out this device.

The game is shorter than previous installments, but not short because of laziness - the last two Infamous games felt overly long with reuse of game play mechanics (create three of the same mission to make a 10 hour game 20 hours long). The focus wasn't on length, but on quality of game play.The story is improved. Choices feel significant, in particular with the differences in ending - the indifference and hate with the Infamous ending versus the concern and care with the True Hero ending show true and varied evolution of the primary character, Delsin. Although his motivation is to save his tribe, he attitude about it and how he gets there is different.Cut scenes are great with facial wrinkles and subtle but key eye movement. They aren't overblown, but important enough to create an interesting story.Game-play is mostly unchanged with a few key exceptions - three are three different power types, the first power type feels like a natural evolution of the electricity powers from the two games whereas the other two power types and the final power type as a reward for game completion feel different and unique. I don't want to spoil these new powers, but let me say that although they have the same power types (hovering, a quick move, a simple shot, a heavy shot, and a grenade), each power caters to a particular play style (shotgun, machine gun, sniper - balanced, fast, even faster), Mobility is no longer a problem (scaling the buildings is a thing of the past), combat is more challenging now that power is consumed even by firing &#34;simple shots&#34; of power. The AI is wise enough to take cover to draw you into combat, and just as nimble and mobile as you are. Fast travel is introduced.The graphics are great. I did notice frame-rate drops, but overall the game is consistent. I don't think that the graphics are better than Killzone, but the artistic quality of the game (the ascetic) is well done. It is a beautiful game.This is a must-have PlayStation 4 game. Why there isn't a multi-player component is surprising - there is much opportunity here for that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"The Closest Thing to a Fairytale... Ever!","reviewText":"Prince of Persia is quite different from the other games in the series and the commercials are misleading.  If you've seen the ads, it looks like an ugly game that features a lone warrior.  The opposite is true!  It's a great looking game and you've got a companion through 99% of the adventure... and she's wonderful!Story 8/10The Prince meets a magical Princess named Elika, who's on the run from palace guards.  He comes to her aid mostly due to his own bravado, rather than her actual need for rescuing.  He gets drawn into a magical adventure where he must help Elika save her kingdom from an evil God who's contaminated the land with a black corrosive slime called The Corruption.  Comic Book Fans will recognize this stuff as Spiderman's Symbiotic Suit.  The story is epic and the romantic chemistry between the characters is great!  85% of the dialogue is really good and 15% misses the mark.  If you can ignore a few bad lines, you'll feel for the characters and enjoy a few laughs.  Most of the dialogue is initiated by YOU, the player.  An icon appears on the lower left corner of the screen and if you press LT, you talk to Elika.  She tells you about the history of the kingdom, gives you hints on puzzles, and flirts.Graphics 9/10The game uses the tech from Assassin's Creed to render some of the most beautifully crafted and fantastically designed levels of all time.  The game is slightly cell shaded which adds to the fairytale atmosphere.  Both the Prince and Elika look and move great.Gameplay:  Exploring 8/10The Prince and Elika must traverse the dangerous environments and get to the Fertile Grounds.  Once they get there, Elika heals the land and removes the corruption.  Navigating the environments has never been easier.  Elika is the best companion ever!  She's single, hot, intelligent, and she grabs you and teleports you to safety every time you fall.  The game doesn't record \"Deaths\" it records \"Saves!\" as in the number of Times Elika saved your life.  If you can beat the game with under 100, you get an achievement.  Good luck with that.  But having her save your life and saying something witty is much better than the old, fall to your death, continue prompt, Yes decision, level reload, 20 seconds of your life gone x 500 times.  Suck it - Prince of Persia Warrior Within!  Anyway, Elika can go wherever the Prince can go and they help each other get through the levels.  You guide the Prince through the levels, jumping, using magic, and props the entire way.  Moving the Prince requires the D-Pad and generously timed button presses to use the props.  You will climb on, over, through, up, down, around, some truly amazing levels!  There might not be enough challenge for the Hard Core gamers because you don't have to aim jumps.  You simply need to time your button presses well.  If you get lost, Elika can summon a magical comet to show you where you need to go.  She's the best companion ever!Once she heals the land, Power Seeds appear all over the level.  At that point, you and Elika can explore and collect them.  After you get a certain amount, Elika gains new powers.Gameplay:  Combat 6/10There aren't many enemies to fight in the game and when you find one, you fight them one at a time.  The combat system is modular.  The Prince has sword combos, gauntlet combos, air combos, and magic combos via Elika that can be strung together to create compound combos.  You're going to have to figure out how to link them yourself while you are fighting.  Despite this, the combat feels restrictive.  Too often the enemies enter a state which makes them immune to all but one of your combos or they initiate 'press the right button fast' or 'mash x' minigames.  At times, I just wanted to fight!  But the game had me jumping through so many hoops, I'd get frustrated.  If an enemy is about to kill you, it's Elika to the rescue.  If the combat was better, I would have given this game a 5.Replay Value: 4/10You can go to the levels in any order, but the path through them is linear.  The combat is also restrictive, so it's hard to have fun there.  The only reason to replay is for achievements.  Try to finish it without Elika saving you 100 times or collecting extra Power Seeds.  Playing through the game once takes about 12 hours.Overall, the game makes innovative leaps to reduce the frustration associated with platforming games.  If you're a casual gamer with a romantic heart and you want a fairytale adventure, this game was made for you!If you want the combat from the previous games or environmental challenges, you may want to skip this game... or at least rent it.If you've ever wanted a magical acrobatic intelligent witty attractive graceful romantic princess of a girlfriend, buy this game and you'll live happily ever after.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2008"}

The storyline was great and the characters instant classics.  And so when I got my Wii one of the first things I did was download this game--one of the best I've ever played in over 20 years of gaming.Needless to say this excellent game has stood the test of time.  It is side-scrolling--pre 3-D--but that is one of the game's strengths in my opinion.  There are some incredibly difficult levels (the mine cars are very tough), but the game is not impossible to beat and provides just enough challenge to really absorb you in it.  Control is fairly simple but another plus--you don't need a whole slew of button combos to master this game, just some dexterity and practice.I would recommend this game either on the Super NES or as a virtual game for the Wii.  Whereas some older games are good just for their nostalgia factor, DK Country is certainly one that can be played and enjoyed even 13 or so years after it's original release.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2007"}

Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four.

Have they learned nothing fromSpore?Modern Warfare 2 is the sequel toCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  I do not know why they dropped the Call of Duty\" from their name, but that is only a small mistake in a series of blunders made by publisher Infinity Ward.  I'll try to be objective about actual gameplay and start with the positives first:Single Player:Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) single player gameplay is absolutely amazing.  It is the most immersive single player experience I have had from an FPS since I first started playing them in 1993. Anyone who has playedCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfarewill understand what I mean by \"immersive,\" and you can learn to expect more of the same with MW2. This is the closest I've come to feeling like I was actually in the military and it is what every other FPS with a single player aspect should strive for.  The story takes place following the events in Modern Warfare, as you take on the characters of Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson and James Ramirez.  Gameplay has some great environments, including Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, and some decent urban environments.  Until you get to the American missions, the urban gameplay environments closely resembles what you find in Modern Warfare, with the exception of an airport mission that calls for some quick thinking.  One of the real standouts however is a snowy mountain, that many people have seen from the trailer.  If you've seen the trailer, you will know that there it ends with a scene that calls for a \"leap of faith\" of sorts.  I played the first time through on veteran and tried to really pretend I was within the game, meaning I took every precaution a real soldier would take not to die.  This heightened the experience for me, nowhere as much as this mission where you have to make that jump.  Without spoiling anything, I can only say that my heart was literally racing during this mission.  I strongly suggest that everyone consider playing the first time on veteran mode, which forces you to be (a lot) more careful and take your time.  This is even more important given that single player mode is over just as quickly as it was in Modern Warfare.  You're looking at an average of maybe 8 hours of gameplay.  I am not a very good player and it took me 15 on veteran.  If you lower the difficulty rating, it will be easier, but the game will be over before you know it.  There are enough save points where I think most players will be able to handle veteran without too much frustration.Disclosure: I have not actually played multiplayer through Infinity Ward's service, but don't feel that I need to to be able to comment and provide the below opinion.Multiplayer:Ugh.  Here is where the fun ends.  Bottomline: this game is a port from the console version.  I realize that Infinity Ward probably gets more sales from consoles than a PC version, and I also realize they lose sales on piracy, but this was NOT the way to handle this release.THERE IS NO DEDICATED SERVER SUPPORT IN MODERN WARFARE 2!Yes, you read that right. In an effort to combat software piracy, and more likely, due to general laziness, you can only play multiplayer on peer to peer through their Infinity Ward web site.  There is no console.  That means no player servers, no customization, and no mods.  IW said their reasoning for this is \"we would like you to play the game the way we designed and balanced it.\"  So they only want you to play by THEIR rules. Why do they CARE if players want to change the rules and add custom weapons or maps?  How does it possibly affect them in any way?  I'll tell you how, it causes them to put more work into the PC version instead of just porting it.  The max amount of players per map is 9v9, so forget about having large clan matches. They also removed the lean ability from the PC version, claiming that it affects game balance. WHAT?!  Is this game supposed to be realistic or not?  So now I have to jump out from behind a building because leaning around it gives me too much of an advantage?  IW's response about whether the PC version is a port or not, was that it is not a port, because it has custom features like \"mouse support and graphic settings.\" WOW, I can change the resolution and use a mouse!  I was planning on buying an Xbox controller and jamming it into my USB port, but I guess I won't have to with these custom mouse features!  IW has confirmed that average ping times of 100ms are acceptable (expect the peer host to have a significant advantage, regardless of what they say), and that there is no way to kick cheating players because IW's flawless system will ban all cheaters.Below is a comparison chart of the PC features between MW and MW2 (I did not originally compile this list)........................................MW....................MW2Networking architecture..........Client/Server.........Peer2PeerAverage ping.....................10-40ms...............100ms+Console commands.................Yes...................NoLean.............................Yes...................NoCustom maps......................Yes...................NoNumber of players................Up to 64..............Up to 18Competitive mods.................Yes...................NoMod tool.........................Yes...................NoAbility to record................Yes...................NoAbility to ban hackers...........Yes...................NoProfiles saved online............No....................Yes (the ONLY advantage MW2 has over MW)ISP/Clan hosted servers..........Yes...................NoBad language filtering...........Yes...................No0 ping advantage for host........No....................Yes (better hope he's on your team)LAN play.........................Yes...................NoFree demo........................Yes...................NoFree downloadable content........Yes...................No - you have to pay for itRequires patch to play online....No....................YesI understand companies need to protect their intellectual property, but getting rid of dedicated servers in a misguided attempt to curb software piracy is a huge mistake.  People WILL pirate the game. I am not aware of any game that has not been cracked by software pirates. The only people Infinity Ward is hurting with this release are legitimate PC owners, the same people who made the original Call of Duty so successful. Do not be fooled into thinking this is anything other than a direct port of the console versions. I do not want to deter people from playing this on Xbox and PS3 though, so my review pertains only to the PC version. As a consumer, you need to decide if the price of this game is worth an amazing 10 hour single player experience.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B009LEIUY4","description":"","reviewerName":"Crayonmuffin","summary":"Spectacular nostalgia","reviewText":"I'm an old school RPG fan. Old school as far back as the OLD first person, gridded dungeons that you had to make your own maps for ON paper in order to survive. There hasn't been really any games that scratched that RPG itch for me, except the Etrian series. I only played the third title before this one and it was alright, but this one completely blew me away. Granted these types of games are an acquired taste for some because of how watered down games have become this day in age, but if you can acquire such a taste then you're in for a treat.Main points of the game: First person dungeon crawling. This is a dungeon crawler in the truest sense of the term. You gather items, gear up, rest, and head to a dungeon to be punished by fairly difficult foes, especially if you run into the strong ones. That being said, this is also an ATLUS games, so you know it's going to be difficult. But the game doesn't punish you for no reason. If you're getting destroyed by a boss or even normal enemies, it's your own fault.Map editing: One of my favorite things about the games. I remember back in the day with old D&D; games and such where you HAD to draw your own maps on grid paper in order to remember your way around and ultimately survive. This game brings the same concept back with having to draw out your own maps as you progress through each dungeon. Having accurate maps is useful for knowing quick routes out of the dungeon if you're doing poorly and knowing if and where there are any item gathering spots, etc.The classes: OH THE CLASSES. I'm a sucked for stat crunching and unique classes and getting them to work well with each other. This is key to winning fights in the game. The starting classes are Fortress, landsknecht, nightseeker, dancer, runemaster, medic, and sniper, with two additional classes unlocked later in the game. Having a diverse team will do you well in the fights to come. Sure, you can have a team of 3 fortresses and they would be basically indestructible, but wouldn't you rather have a dancer to buff the party's attack stats and nightseeker to debilitate the enemy? Finding synergy between classes is key to being successful.The only downside to the game that I've found so far is lack of character story and main story overall. The characters you choose for your team have nearly no narrative or character themselves, they're just what you use to fight basically. Not a huge deal for me because I find the game fun and make up my own stories for them in my head, but it's a con for most.Secondly is the main story. I won't really get into it but it's kind of bland and there isn't really any depth to it.Other than that this game gets a near perfect rating from me. If it had a more engaging story it would be a perfect dungeon crawler, especially a portable one.TL;DR version: If you're on the fence about this game, get it. Give it a good try and I can guarantee you'll like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"michael jordan \"sucks\"","summary":"Aaaammmmmaaaaaaazzzziiiiiinnnggg!!!!!","reviewText":"First off, let me start by explaining the situation we have right now regarding the console wars. People seem to think we don't need Nintendo anymore since we have the two powerhouses in Sony and Microsoft, but man they couldn't be more wrong. I've been buying and playing Nintendo games on Nintendo consoles since the early days when they first brought out the nes. I'll never forget the great experiences I had with it. Then the SNES came out and it was an amazing successor to the nes. I didn't think video games could get much better and then came the beloved n64 which quickly proved me wrong. With games like GoldenEye, perfect dark, conkers, Mario kart, turok and the list goes on and on. Sony entered the console market at this time too by releasing the ps1. I bought one, as well as a load of games and I remember thinking, this is the peak for video games! I played crash, medal of honor, syphon filter and many more. Although the ps1 sold a lot more units than the n64, I still considered the n64 to be the better console overall because it had more classic games. Next, the GameCube and ps2 came out. I have to admit, I hated the GameCube and every game that came out for it. Heck, I even hated the controller and that stupid yellow peg leg joystick. The ps2 was amazing though and I probably bought 50 games for it. I honestly never touched my GameCube again after I bought the ps2 and I promised myself that if Nintendo continued down that path then I was going to be done with them for good. Then the Xbox came out in 2001 and I bought all the exclusives and every game I had on ps2. That's right, I wanted to see the differences in both consoles. The differences were incredible to say the least. The Xbox had better graphics, controls, load times and was just more fun overall. Aside from a few ps2 exclusives, Xbox was just a much better experience for me and that's why I give the crown to Microsoft for that generation. The next console I bought was the Wii. It was perfect and seemed to be the holy grail of video game consoles. It won sales wise last gen and rightfully so because it had the best games and the most innovation. That brings me to the main issue I have with the gaming market now days and gamers in general. Why are we so concerned about graphics to the point that we'll pick graphics over innovation. If you haven't noticed, it's already almost like real life, so there's really not much more room to grow graphically. However, the sky's the limit for true innovators like Nintendo or whoever else wants to step up with new ideas. I'll be the first to admit that Nintendo needs some new franchises to stay relevant, but you still can't deny their ability to make amazing games and even durable hardware for that matter. Lets face it, if Nintendo dies then gaming could very well die too because we can't rely on Sony and Microsoft to pave the way with new innovative ideas. It's nothing against either company because I'm not a fanboy and I own every console thus far except for ps4 and xb1, but facts are facts. Their content with more powerful hardware and slight controller changes whereas Nintendo brings an entirely new experience everytime! It's hit or miss for them, but at least they're taking chances and that's what leaders do. So, stop all the Nintendo hating and everyone get out there and support them, so we can see what they'll do next. OK, as for this particular game, I love it and I think it's the best Mario game ever made. I really have a feeling this gen will be like the n64 vs. Ps1. By that I mean the ps4 will win in sales numbers, but I believe the Wiiu will have more legendary experiences. Only time will tell, but I just wish for a great generation of gaming despite what console it's on. Happy gaming!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

Getting through the game doesn't take too long and might not present the greatest challenge; close encounters with enemies are the only time you'll really have to be tactical. The charm of the game is it's unique presentation, and everything stands and falls on your willingness to take on something different. You have to readjust from your typical shooter experience, because this is nothing like it. The timing and tactics are vastly different. After a few days, when you've made it through the campaign, there are also some time attacks and trials to face and unlock; but therein lies the problem as well, it would've been more fun to go into any of them whenever you want to, find your way around your favourite and then fine-tune your time based on that. Attempting the time trials, I was quickly discouraged to continue. It was just too tricky to make that perfectly timed leap or sprint, and unless you find the concept of speedruns and time trials absolutely gripping, there's little incentive to keep on failing (as I see it). If you just love shaving that extra second or five-hundreds of a second off your best time, this is the game to get. If you just want to have fun and play, perhaps you're inclined to save some money by loaning or just renting it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}

Although Dead Space is not perfect (The missions are all very similar (objective-wise), and the mini-games were few and unoriginal) the build up in suspense and the visuals take the helm here. I played it on Normal with the lights off and surround sound in full force and it's an experience to behold. It's like being dropped directly inside a Sci-fi horror movie.There's one more thing I'll note that I don't see anyone else has mentioned.

This is extremely annoying in the higher difficulties when badguys can kill you with fewer shots.No replay mode.  You can't replay a previous save with all your weapons and moves unlocked so in the early levels your relying on alot of the same moves to get the job done, especially if you want a high multiplier.  (which looks cool at first but after awhile it gets kinda boring if you do the same moves over and over)Things i DID like:Game is very easy.  Worst thing you want is a game that plays great but is impossible to enjoy because the game is too hard to play at times.Once you upgrade all your moves, the game is extremely fun,  Even if you have to double back to the same spot for a wall run that leads into a wall kick and a perfect springboard off a enemy.  It's extremely satisfying to pull those moves off.Alot of weapons to choose from. Just in case you get tired of unlimited ammo on your pistols you can burn through limited supply of shogun , SMG or exploding crossbow ammo.Game has a movie feel to it.  It pretty much plays like a movie in certain spots and some recognizable actors have some voice spots in the game as well.Overall its a 4/5 for me. Its a very fun and enjoyable game towards the end and what keeps it from not being great is some of the clumsy platforming and the inability to use your unlocked abilities and weapons on previous levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}

Number of game mags said \"A few bugs\" , a few which means more than 3 turned out to be many.Some of them lied about searching thou the game for 400 hours, it's false , at 100 hours on a profile the glitches get worse and worse, after 5 or so months of playing a single profile, i was 12 mega bite and took 2 minutes to load up , then it would freeze, i had almost 300 hours on it, just to see about this \"400 hour life\" the only way it could happen is to have it sit for 400 hours not moving.The game overall is crap, waste of good money if you bought it new, and all the later add ons just add to the problem , the only add on that went pretty smoothly was Point Lookout, and that is the only one.So before you company flag wavers and hired guns that watch out for the product's progress on popularity began to attack my email, take a long hard look on YouTube on the dozens of people posting proof of these claims before you try to attack me.

MacMahon","summary":"Underrated Old School Fun For Launch Day!","reviewText":"Knack isn't going to light anyone's gaming passions on fire. What it will do though is usher in a new generation with impressive visuals and fun, time-tested gameplay.You play as the title character Knack, a jumpy punch batch of pebbles basically that runs and punches through the game with reckless abandon. The game is trying to bring back the feel of a Crash Bandicoot or Jak and Daxter, and largely succeeds at times. There's tough jumps here and there, tough combat everywhere. Timing is super important, even in the most basic fight. It feels old school when you die on a random enemy because you didn't bother to time your attack between his swings. It's engaging and keeps you invested in the game in a very classic way.Basic gameplay string: jump over some stuff, enter an enemy area. Three or so enemies attack you in various ways (range, large swings, close swings, etc.). You have to focus on dodging because you're extremely vulnerable, so the gameplay focuses on movement, waiting for patterns and timing your strikes. People say it's hard but it's more that the game demands your attention, rather than being tough in general.The visuals being amazing or disappointing will probably depend on what you like in gaming visuals. The game looks insanely, insanely clean and crisp. You won't see a jagged edge or muddy distance view anywhere in the game. It looks like a Pixar movie in the cutscnes and even often in the main gameplay, and the vibrant colors will really impress if you're used to the darker color pallets of last-generation. I was pretty impressed overall to be honest, but if you're someone that wants a ton of detail and doesn't care about crispness, you might be disappointed.Overall I am glad I took a risk and picked Knack as my free game for launch with the buy two get one free deal. I'm not sure it's worth $60 compared to other titles out there for launch, but it's fun and very old school in a way no other launch games are. If you grew up on NES, SNES, PS1 and PS2 platformers and combat games there will be a lot in Knack to appeal to that kid inside you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit.

Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

E Jackson","summary":"Sega goes bye-bye","reviewText":"Finally, Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity!  Sega is famous for all kinds of failed (and embarrassing) video game consoles they brought to the world, but this time they actually \"kind of\" got it right with the Dreamcast.Unfortunately, Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success.  They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999.  Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before, and people weren't going to be fooled again.  This was now or never for Sega.  If the Dreamcast failed, Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer.  It was in September of 1999.  People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming.  That wasn't the only thing going on.  Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2, which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for.  It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business.  Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that).And so, the release date for the Dreamcast arrived.  With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game, what would happen?  What would happen to Sega?  The Dreamcast would hit the market and... nothing.  No sound.  No noise.  So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there.  An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999, and people didn't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior, soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems.  Sega also failed because of their long, frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems (such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn).  Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works... only to end up not supporting it.  They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes.  Sega would always fall asleep on the job.  This would happen time and time again, with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average, incomplete gaming consoles.  It's like the people who worked for Sega would always say \"let's start something and not finish it\".When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn, people finally couldn't TAKE anymore.  Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope.  Sega was now the enemy and they had to go.  A gaming console needs a giant selection of games, and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history (with the Genesis).  Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.In the case of the Dreamcast, Sega tried to support it but it was too late.  Sony had defeated them.  Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One.  Hard to believe but it's true: the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast  off the market, making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.In 1999, Sega knew they wouldn't be able to compete with the Playstation 2, so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console.  Sega was DONE.  They admitted defeat.  That, my friends, made milions and millions of people very happy.  No more junk on the market.  That announcement was the best thing that could have happened, and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion.  I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony.  Now I can laugh at it.  Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony.  Didn't work.  Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense.  I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation's creation were laughing in piles of money over the \"fly, play thing, fly\" commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate.  Ha!  That ugly, gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast, and I hope Sega fans never forget it.It's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2.  Why?  Because they are successful video game consoles.  People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles.  No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point.  People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around.  Sega's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them.  If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles, maybe they'd still be around today.  As it stands, they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them.  Nintendo and Sony didn't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.With the release of Nintendo's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November, along with the Playstation 3, we don't have to laugh at Sega's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world.  Goodbye Sega.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2006"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Mark D.

The other thing that bothers me is you can't leave things behind like RE0 lets you do. Still, the graphics are good and the game is fun, but it's not the best game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

A little more than two years after the original Mass Effect, players will finally get a chance to save the galaxy once more. But with your odds of survivability as low as the stakes are high, combat as visceral as some of the best shooters out there, and a larger, darker, and more complex cast, BioWare has succeeded in upping the ante, and the aforementioned description certainly fits. Mass Effect 2 is an intense, and engaging experience that delivers on its promise of a universe which is truly shaped by the players' actions.The story starts off with a bang, and barely slows down from that point. I won't dare spoil how the game starts off, but soon enough you'll find yourself working for Cerberus, a shady organization focused on protecting humanity's place in the galaxy. An alien race known as the Collectors has been kidnapping human colonists, and it's up to you to find out why.The intensity of the story, and the effect of your actions is vastly improved thanks to the game's basic scenario. After you finish the opening few hours of the game, you'll spend the rest of your time essentially preparing yourself for the end-game experience. This time around, Shepard and his team are on a suicide mission, but the more you do in terms of side quests, exploration, and recruitment will serve to up your chances of survival. This concept makes for a very tightly-wound narrative in which everything you do seems important, exactly the feeling you'd want to get as the savior of the galaxy.Shepard's dirty dozen make for an excellent cast of characters to whom you really grow attached throughout the events of the game. Shepard is out to recruit the best of the best, which doesn't always lead him to the most pure-hearted people in the galaxy. In fact, most of the characters in the game are, on the surface, pretty bad people (or aliens), but once you get to know them, you'll find out just how three-dimensional, and memorable they really are.The conversation system largely remains the same, although it has a few nice new touches. You can still select dialogue options to further your Sheperd's status as the badass renegade, or the noble paragon. This time around, however, conversations are much more dynamic, and the interrupt system add some great bits of action.Combat is vastly improved. Action is intense, and fast-paced, easily on par with some of the best third person shooters in recent memory.The basic formula is that of a stop-and-pop shooter a la Gears of War. Playing it smart, and using cover is a must if you're to survive. But what makes Mass Effect 2's combat so unique is its mastery of the various abilities each class has at their disposal. From the Vanguard's in-your-face abilities which focus on putting as little distance as possible between you and your enemy, to the Sentinel's Power Armor, which adds another layer of defense.Classes vary dramatically to support different play styles, so that those who like to run around guns blazing, and those that like to take a more tactical approach will both be satisfied.BioWare seems to have admitted defeat in regards to planetary exploration on the Mako. The result is the loss of a rather mediocre gameplay component, but it still comes at the cost of less variety. Exploring planets now consists of either landing in a more enclosed area to complete a side quest, or playing the rather tedious mining mini-game.Even though Mass Effect 2 isn't as varied as its predecessor, its conversation system is nearing perfection, and its shooter gameplay is far more fleshed out, and all around satisfying.Mass Effect 2's graphics engine hasn't received a significant overhaul, but the art-style is quite improved. The shiny chrome environments of locales such as the Citadel contrast very well with the dark, twisted nature of places like Omega, a seedy space station, and they all evoke the feel of a classic space opera. The graphics department is not without its flaws, however. Facial animations aren't what they could be, especially considering the heavy emphasis on conversation, and there are a few clipping issues here and there.The sound department, similarly, is great, but not without flaws. The voice-overs, and sound effects are superb, but the real star of the show is the soundtrack, which provides an excellent mix of classic ambient science fiction tunes, to truly memorable scores. I did have multiple instances of sound dropping out during cut-scenes. Again, in a game that is as dialogue heavy as Mass Effect 2, that kind of flaw really sticks out.Mass Effect 2 is a game that will last pretty much as long as you want it to. You can easily blast through to the end-game in about 15 hours, but if you're a real completionist the experience could easily last over 35 hours. Although your ability to rush through the game comes with a wink and nudge, as being ill-prepared before the endgame might not go over well. Luckily, the game's sidequests have been very much improved upon, and upgrading all your squad members becomes addicting.Mass Effect 2 is an achievement alone in just how much it improves upon its predecessor. The combat system goes above and beyond the call of duty, plot and characters are much more memorable, and the overall structure is the game is pure genius. Though the game has technical flaws, you'll be too absorbed in the narrative, and action to care a whole lot. Mass Effect 2 is a suicide mission that is well worth embarking on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Behold, the survival genre wanes","reviewText":"An impregnable darkness lingers within the corridors of the haunted hospital, a faint yet disturbing crackling sound echoes close by, then the shuffling of feet.  A silence wells over the man plodding through the blood dried halls.  Handling a crude pipe and a trusty flashlight as he's only means of protection, James Sunderland goes on.  The impenetrable mist of fog harbors unseen monsters, they hunt him, leaving hints of their presence with distorted cries.  His flashlight emits limited visibility.  He is rapt to find his former love, who supposedly wrote him a letter to convene at the ethereal town of Silent Hill.  A letter she has written from the grave beyond. . .When my big ol' ears chanced upon the story behind the exaggerated gore game, I was surprisingly head over heels.  Inspired by Hollywood gore-fests and perhaps Resident Evil, Konami's suspenseful game was something to get all school-girl about.  Irresistible screenshots from various zines slapped me in the face, saluting it as revolutionary.  Presenting one devil of a pessimistic setting, Silent Hill 2 looked to have everything going for it; an absorbing story, a mix of hair-raising visuals, and an arsenal of, oddly enough, attractive undead nurses.  Needless to say, I expected a spine-tingling crusade into Hell, and the game delivered just a little too much of unpleasant Hell.  My definition of Hell, you ponder?  First, the apparent dizziness from the camera scheme.  Konami initiated  phase \"super artsy\", incorporating a futile attempt to capitalize on the aspects of horror films.  The last time a director went artistic was the disaster known as \"The Cell ,\" starring the no-talent Jennifer Lopez.  Unfortunately, Konami nearly ranks on \"The Cell's\"  verge.  Secondly, the gameplay identically mirrors the exact setup to its predecessor.  Basically the player must chronologically progress from point A to point B while eluding monsters along the way.  Other than the flashlight and the pipe, there are guns with very limited ammo.  Akin to Resident Evil, the player should conserve ammo and sling em on mutant bosses.  Once you play an hour of Silent Hill 2, you pretty much played the whole thing; player's feel heartbeats stem from the controller, stumble on a grousing oddity playing hide-and-seek in the midst of excessive  fog, scramble from vomiting enemies, flirt or dart away from stalking nurses, collect an item here and there to unlock a door, crack plenty of conundrums, equip your game face for an upcoming boss, and finally, if you`re a vet to the horror genre, you'll  feel the wane of the scare moments.  Corresponding to the rules of the now dreary survival genre, tactical options on gameplay is naught.The only distinguishable difference in Silent Hill 2 to that of its predecessor is the dazzling facelift.  A sheer novelty, the PlayStation 2 refines the graphics to the director's own dark, morbid world.  Konami's underscore has to be the highly polished environment.  Shadowy and stark, the town is heavily congested by indolently flowing fog.  The atmosphere is so detailed that it can probably manifest a life of its own.  There areas where pure darkness shrouds the room with nothing more than a flashlight guiding the player.  Animation on both the characters and monsters are parallel to the fluidity of water.  PS2 harnesses the best facial expressions I have ever seen.  In each CG sequence the mugs on the characters are superbly distinct, showcasing a uniquely designed emotion.  Graphically, Silent Hill 2  has attained an otherwise unreachable ascent, until now.In the audio department, there's the fundamental elements found respectfully for this type of genre.  There are downright disquieting silences mainly found in the game.  The music is commonly suspended as the player focuses on the presence of threats by sounds of movement or verbal noises.  The few tracks of music suit and correspond to the mistrustful setting.  Sound effects are wonderfully rendered like the scraping of metal, the shuffling feet, and the bizarre crunches.  Although the sound effects and music are excellent, the voice-overs in the CG sequences have not improved over the original.  Again, the Japanese creators have mistakenly selected incompetent actors who sound insanely cheesy.Despite the promise Silent Hill 2 had going for it, the evils of gameplay slipups tarnish its potential.  If Konami were to patch up the wounds on the inescapable camera crisis and append a fresh sheet of innovations, this would have been passed up as the king of the survival genre.

Wells","summary":"Play to Your Strengths and Rewrite the Fate of a World","reviewText":"Kingoms of Amalur Reckoning is a 3rd person RPG that combines fighting hordes of minions, epic boss fights, tons of loot, and a blacksmithing / gem-crafting / alchemy system into gorgeous world filled with bright colors and spectacular detail.  The result is fairly deep and customized experience that is a lot of fun to play.While there are 3 basic classes to play (rogue, warrior, sorcery) skills can be selected in any of the the classes to create your own customized character designed around how you like to play the game.  This customization fits well into the meta-narrative of the game.  The game begins with you resurrected through a Gnome's machine, and hence unbound by fate/destiny.  Your lack of a predetermined fate allows you to alter the fate of the world.I picked up the game because I had read that RA Salvatore had written the story/history for Amalur and Todd McFarlane had designed the art.  On both counts, Amalur shines in a unique brilliant way (like the many gem shards you'll collect and craft).  The story is a world ravaged by war.  The lorestones throughout the world and coversations with NPC give the player the sense that Amalur is alive and has existed for a long time.The artwork is fantastic.  The world is colorful.  Even the dungeons often have bright eerily glowing plants in them.  I loved the detail that some of the plants bloom in the presence of magic, so as you walk into a room the floors and walls sometimes come alive.The looting system is quite addictive. Basically enemies drop items that you can salvage for parts in order to create your own items.  Or you can \"socket\" gems to enhance dropped loot. There are also sets of unique armor that can be found throughout the world.At any point in the game if you decide that you spent skill points or ability points incorrectly, you can re-stat your character at Fateweavers.  If you have the right gear (and enough coins), you can be a great-sword wielding tank for one mission and a stealthy assassin for the next. I personally have been playing largely in the sorcery build--lots of fun especially when you get the meteor spell (be warned there are lots of critters that more or less immune to various kinds of magic, so make sure you have some Chakrams or a staff that can do some physical damage as well).I have played for many hours at this point, and as far as value this is a 5-star game.  There are very few games you can log 100+ hours and still have plenty of places to go and things to do.  Great art, a pretty engrossing story/world, fun play, addictive crafting and looting, lots of places to explore. 5-stars all the way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"Can't wait to play the next!","reviewText":"Without a doubt this is the best comic book game I've ever played. Granted, I've only played a handful, but I've been wanting to play this game since it was first released. With so many games in my backlog, it took me a while to get to this, but I even bumped it up so I could play it sooner. I was not disappointed.Playing this game is the best iteration of what it's like to be the Batman. From his gadgets to his stealth, Arkham Asylum's Bruce Wayne employs the best of the franchise. From his chiseled Michael Keaton chin to his grotesquely buff body to Kevin Conroy's voice talent to the simple costume design, this is one of the best animated visualizations of the dark knight, only bested by the comics and the animated series themselves. Not to mention Mark Hamill's expected supreme voice acting, everything is done meticulously to make you enjoy the game to its fullest. The use of the mythos' villains is creative and fresh, even if you're very familiar with them.The only gripes I have about the game are that I felt it was too short, though the Riddler's challenges make it a tad bit longer, and the boss fights were extremely easy. The toughest fights I've found in the game, besides the challenges, were the group brawls with the inmates. The final battle was sort of a disappointment, but that still didn't deter me to get excited about the next installment, to see what more Rocksteady had to offer. And from what I've heard, I've only just begun to enjoy their Arkham franchise.The gadgets are handled well in the game, and the third-person perspective is excellent. The game is as realistic as it gets, though it's a wonder how much incredible stamina Batman can have in one night.It's a must play for any video game aficionados, especially those who enjoy Batman. And who doesn't?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

The detail is amazing, and the locations are beautiful. At times, though, you get the sense that you're playing a last-gen game, because there are things that look 3-dimensional, and you think you should be able to jump onto a ledge, but it turns out to be 2D without any ability to jump or grab onto things.  The cinematic cut-scenes are great, and the voice-acting is excellent.  The balance of cut-scenes within the game is great, and helps move the story along.  Finish a puzzle, and you get a great cutscene.Lara moves and responds excactly as she did in the first Tomb Raider, and I was really comfortable jumping back into her role.  At times, the controls seems a little sluggish, especially when she needs to wind-up when swinging on bars.  Her character animations are excellent, though, and I feel the interface between the controller and what you see on the screen is really smooth.  She's an easy character to control, but sometimes lining her up in 3D space on a ledge can be tricky.  And there are times when you can't judge how far away she is from something, so expect to die along the way here and there.The load times are acceptable -- when you first start a level.  However, if you die, the entire level loads again, which seems odd and slows your progress.  You would expect Lara to respawn immediately, but that doesn't happen.  If there is a cut-scene at the reload point, you'll start at the cut-scene, which can be skipped.  In essence, it's hard to keep the action moving, especially when you want to get right back in and correct your mistakes.  You get stuck waiting for the reload.The puzzles are the best challenge of the TR series.  They are hard enough without being frustrating.  However, it does get tedious at times trying to do things over and over again, especially if you get close but then die.  Figuring out a puzzle without using a guide is very rewarding, however, and in this game, you really feel like you're doing something...you're in the adventure and playing the role of Lara.This is more than a shooter -- it's a great story with great controls and great graphics, with just enough puzzling to keep your mind going.  There really is nothing like Tomb Raider, and this is a good outing for the 360.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2007"}

Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"Skip this year's Madden","reviewText":"If you're looking for a good football game for your PS3 or 360 and don't want to spend much, get Madden 09; perhaps one of the best.  If cost is no issue, get Madden 11; from what I've played, ranks right up there with 09.  But this year I feel like EA took a vacation.After the release of Madden 11, the price of this game dropped and motivated me to buy one, hoping that it would be all the great things of 09 and more.  Sadly, it was not.  Every once in a while, EA sports does something that makes me wonder if they have a second set of eyes look over a game before it's released.  In 08, it was the fact that you couldn't edit a custom team after you created it.  This year, it's the fact that you have NO CONTROL over who is on your custom team.  One of my favorite things to do on a football video game is make a custom team with some of the greats of that year and some custom players of my own.  But for Madden 10, you can't do that.  I've heard rumors that there's an elaborate way to trade players off of pro teams to yours, but I don't want to mess with other rosters.Another downside is that even though the graphics seem to be an improvement, occasionally their movement is very unrealistic.  Walking through objects and sliding on the field without moving their feet, things that didn't bother us 10 years ago, but now are things that we watch for.The mini games and extras seem to be recycled from last year, and none of them are entertaining enough to play.Still and all, it's a great game with easy controls and good graphics and worth buying if you're in the market. Madden 09 set the bar pretty high and was a vast improvement over the previous year, but the trend did not continue for Madden 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The Legend of Zelda does it again! Simply amazing...","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, and arguably, it's *thee* greatest. With each release, Nintendo has showed us the magic of journeying through Hyrule's beautiful kingdom. Now, they have done it again, greatly injecting innovation into the tried-and-true formula of past titles. This is a Zelda game unlike any other, and feels all at once both an incredible nostalgic celebration of 25 years of history, and a wholly new adventure full of wild, awesome new directions. Get ready for a fairly long review, but please know that this is written from the heart of a young man who loves the series above most others in his favorite pastime.The story and characters present in Skyward Sword are very different among the other Zelda titles, despite the obvious recurring ones. I don't just mean the amazing setting of Link's home, Skyloft, a fantastical city floating above the clouds where everone is bonded to their own guardian birdlike creature, a loftwing. No, from the start, Nintendo truly changes almost everything of what you'd come to expect from a Zelda game. This is the earliest tale in the series chronologically, acting as a prequel, making way forOcarina of Time'stale to come. Zelda is not a princess here, just another common schoolgirl. She and Link have been best friends since childhood, and may even have feelings for each other (it's pretty obvious, and incredibly touching. My wife and I were both pretty moved by it). In Skyloft, the local school is essentially a knights academy, the uniform being a tunic that is easily recognizable to fans of the series. After completing a ceremony to become a senior in his class (the senior tunic is, you guessed it, dark green), Zelda and Link ride together through the sky to celebrate. Out of nowhere, a malevolent tornado knocks Zelda to \"the surface,\" a vast, unexplored land below the cloud cover and once again, Link takes up the mantle of being a fated hero, destined to save the day. I'll stop here, because this is virtually spoiler free and if I say more it won't be. Just know that Nintendo has really changed up the formula of story and characters we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise, and as a result, Skyward Sword feels incredibly refreshing.Another immediately noticeable change is in presentation. The story is much, much more cinematic than Zelda has ever been. Cinematic shot angles are much more dynamic than ever before, character expression is stunning, animation is smooth and realistic, and the writing is just fantastic. If anything, this feels like a very intimate entry in the Zelda series, not just epic or grand like past titles. It's a lovely direction for the Zelda series, if you ask me. The characters all come to life thanks to this presentation, of course, but the writing present certainly helps too. Each character has so much personality, and talking to each of them is a joy. Link is a somewhat distracted dreamer with his head in the clouds, loves to sleep, but has tons of courage and kindness, a true hero. Accompanying him in his journey is Fi, a new kind of companion to the series. Fi looks like a ceramic doll, her \"speech\" sounds likeGLaDOS, and is purely logic driven. She is amazing. Zelda is a strong-willed, tough tomboy of sorts, and very lovable. Lord Ghirahim, the new villain, is *extremely* compelling and creepy (Ganandorf makes no direct appearance). All of these characters, as well as the plethora of side characters, are written and presented beautifully.The art design and graphical implementation is awesome here. The game has married the art design of two past masterpiece Zelda title styles into one wholly unique direction. You have more realistic people and settings, like in the dark, matureTwilight Princess, but you also have the vibrant color and imagination ofThe Wind Waker, and it is a joy to behold. Nintendo EAD designed the game to look like a water color painting, and I must say, they did a fantastic job doing so. Draw distances are fairly short, and anything beyond is purposely blurred to look exactly like a water-color painting of the impressionist style, full of  brushstrokes of beautiful color. I am deeply impressed here. The Wii is a painfully underpowered system in comparison to its two competitors, but it is genius art design like this that shows why the Wii has had some of the most beautiful titles of this generation (Metroid Prime 3,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Super Mario Galaxy,Super Mario Galaxy 2,Okami, now this game, the list goes on and on). To put it succinctly, Skyward Sword is one of the most beautiful games in recent memory, and that is totally thanks to the absolutely brilliant (and well implemented) art design.Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai; any fan of Nintendo will instantly recognize these names as two of the greatest musical composers of video gaming. They are almost unrivaled as composers, writing some of the most iconic music in the entire medium. Koji worked as musical supervisor in this title (as well as composed the main theme and some other songs). Hajime was in charge of music composition. This may be, and I *do not* say this lightly, some of their very best work yet. The music here ranges from the entire spectrum of musical emotion: epic, intimate, touching, sad, meditative, dark, joyous, achingly beautiful, uplifting, goofy/doofy (for a certain character), anything you can imagine. Each theme, whether for an event, a character, a place, whatever, is absolutely perfect for its place and can greatly change depending on the situation. It takes something special for music to not only define the experience for any gamer playing the game, but also convey the emotion and thought its supposed to, and the soundtrack here does so perfectly. Like most Zelda games, Link acquires a musical instrument that helps progress the story (Ocarina of time had... well... duh. Wind Waker had a baton), here it is a harp. You can play it at any time, and when you do, you can actually accompany the beautiful background music of wherever you happen to be on the harp. That's very, very cool. Great job Koji and Hajime! You're amazing.The gameplay is what you're probably the most curious about. Does the Wii-Motion Plus work? Yes, it does very well, for the most part. You'll have to deal with calibration from time to time, sometimes actions won't register the way you hoped, but it's not too big a deal and doesn't happen nearly enough to mar the experience. The 1:1 swordplay works pretty flawlessly once you become acquainted with it. Link will seamlessly swing his sword however you do. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, it all works quite well. Pretty much every enemy you will encounter will require a different strategy to defeat, and I have found that the swordplay grows more enthralling with each hour I play (Boss fights are outstanding). It took me quite a while to get used to it, but I must say that this is truly the game the Wii was made nearly six years ago for. It's about time. The quest items you'll find are also a blast to use. They give you some new ones right off the bat, and they're all awesome, feeling completely new yet appropriate for the franchise. Also, Link now has stamina that runs out as he climbs and dashes throughout the world (yes, Link can now sprint around if you'd like). Link's stamina actually adds a small layer of strategic depth to the game, and the concept comes into play in many scenarios throughout the game. This gameplay concept worried me at first, but it's actually really enjoyable, and implemented excellently.So far, I have been through three temples in about 20 hours (I bought my copy at a midnight release \"party\" and have been playing ever since). Gone is the field-dungeon-field formula of past titles. Instead, here you have a hub world, the realm above the clouds, with Skyloft as your main town to visit. Here you can restock supplies, buy or upgrade your shield and other equipment using items you've scavenged in your questing rpg-style, and go on very personal side quests that feel very much likeMajora's Maskdid, making for a character-driven experience. A great change of formula, one I was *very* skeptical about beforehand.You can ride your loftwing and drop to the surface world below at key rifts in the clouds. Here, you have more concentrated lands you can adventure through until you get to a dungeon/temple that will advance the story. The world below, and its temples, feel quite a lot like the Metroid series. The land is more condensed and concentrated, feeling like dungeon of sorts by themselves, but as you acquire newer items, more and more dimensions will open up in those places as you revisit them. It's a huge change-up to the Zelda formula, but one that feels surprisingly good. As I've said, I've played through three temples so far and I am amazed at the ingenuity of them. Yes, you'll be pushing blocks and shooting targets to open doors, but you'll also encounter brilliant new puzzles. I mean, the puzzles are challenging and downright laugh-inducing in their ingenuity, and feel very satisfying when you figure them out. Combine this with the totally awesome new items, stellar swordplay, and ease of use and you get the feeling that every area feels like an innovation, in much the same way playing through Super Mario Galaxy 2 felt like standing before a firing squad of brilliant new ideas. I am downright astonished. I did not think it could be done, honestly, but this game really has reinvigorated the series through great change to the formula rather than refining it further like Twilight Princess did, and trust me when I say no one is more surprised than me.This is a brilliant game, even among the other entries in what has been for 25 years a brilliant series. It takes Zelda in a plethora of new directions, while miraculously feeling *exactly* like a true-to-form Zelda game. Color me surprised. If you're a fan of Zelda, then you don't need me to tell you to go get this right now. This series has some of the most diehard fans of any gaming franchise out there, but just for emphasis' sake, I proudly, and loudly proclaim that this game is incredible! Buy it, soar through the realms above, and dive to the vast, mysterious lands below and fulfill your destiny to save the world once again!* I know this review is quite long, but honestly, this game has so much that merits attention, the review could be much, much longer and still be appropriate. I will edit my review as I play through the game more if I feel there is something worth mentioning that I come across. However, I feel that this is a pretty good summary that hopefully gives you a good picture of the game. Seriously, go get it, like, right now. You won't regret it.Final Update, 11/27/11:Ok, after playing the game for roughly 50 hours I have finally beaten Skyward Sword. In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Each and every hour spent in this game was filled to the brim with brilliance and excellence, and not one single minute felt like boring filler that artificially extended the game. This feels like the Super Mario Galaxy 2 of Zelda titles, where there seems to be an exciting new gameplay/puzzle element at every turn. The story is incredible, with a lot of twists that genuinely thrilled and surprised me. This game essentially acts as an origin story for the entire Zelda series. Pretty much every element that you're familiar with from Zelda games see their true origin here, and it is spectacular (I won't give any spoilers though, you'll be blown away when you experience it for yourself). I have to say that I have not been this entranced and enthralled by a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time or The Wind Waker, and I am a HUGE fan of pretty much every entry in the entire Zelda series, so I don't say that lightly. The music is among the series' very best, which by itself is a massive accomplishment. The visuals the art design are incredibly beautiful, some of the most gorgeous and brilliantly inspired of the past decade, despite the underpowered system it is on. Because of all of this, I was compelled to play this constantly until beating it, AND there's a new game plus mode that adds substantially to the game as well! For fans of the series, this game is an immediate must-own. I give it the highest recommendation possible. I absolutely love this game, and I'm fairly certain most of you out there will too.*That's my final statement. This is meant to finalize the points I made from my original review, which I think will be as detailed and informative as anyone would want or need. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Totally overrated...","reviewText":"From what people make this game out to be, it was supposed to be the &quot;best game of all time&quot; perhaps, but I saw it completely different. I dunno if it is just me, but I found this games storyline incredibly boring, the battle system was OK in some areas, and the music was absolutely dreadful. Let me break it down for you....Music: 1/5...Why? Because it repeats the same tunes over...and over...and OVER AGAIN. The reason I gave it one star, is because when you first hear the music it sounds good, but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game, its tedious and very annoying. And when it comes down to it I wasn't very satisfied with the music to begin with. Like for example, most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music, so it gets very repetitive.Storyline: 2/5I found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating. Not once in the game did I really care about the characters or what was really going on. And there is so much talking in this game I could probably fall asleep after drinking 10 glasses of cafe mocha...To be blunt...there is way too much talking...and the story isnt explained till the end. So throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going on.Entertainment- 3/5Why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment? Well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interesting.Playability- 4/5This is probably the only good part about this game. You can actually jump around here (unlike most RPGs) and there is plenty to explore in your environment. This sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeons...not so dull.Graphics- 3.5/5The graphics are alright, not good enough to give four stars, but pretty good for when it came out. I am a sucker for 3d playstation one style graphics...kinda the old-school style that playstation RPGs used to have. If you are looking for final fantasy 8 graphics....you wont find them here.Overall- 2.5/5If you have a lot of time on your hands...or like playing games for extended periods of time...this is for you.I however, do not enjoy playing games for 80 hours just to see the ending.

Mullins","summary":"It could have been so much more","reviewText":"This is the game that has been promised to those who have spent hours each day dreaming about how awesome it would be to be a truly powerful Jedi. It was supposed to allow you to experience the role of an utterly powerful Jedi/Sith like no other game. And it does, sort of. Overall the game does a pretty good job of maintaining the illusion of being a super powered bad dude. But its the minor imperfections, and there are a lot, that drag it back down towards mediocrity.As an adventuring game with a large amount of platforming the camera gives me a large amount of trouble. There are situations where it will fix in place and make maneuvering very difficult. It will also occasionally cause you to miss landings and fall to your death. There are also a large amount of spaces that you would think you are able to maneuver your character to, only to learn they aren't part of the stage as you fall to your death. Without good camera control you aren't able to ever get a good look at these areas before you commit.The combat can be fun, but suffers from very poor targeting. There are so many times you try to scoop up an enemy only to have your target change. So you lift a rock as a droid pummels you. And for being a guy with a light saber there are a huge amount of enemies equipped to fight against you. You would think that after watching the movies you should be able to cut a bloody swath through most of your enemies. But not so. It turns out a large amount of things you face in combat just happen to be lightsaber resistant. Which manages to kill the fantasy a bit. There is nothing like being unable to get past the guard of a bug creature because he claw can't be cut. You would think everyone in the Empire fights lightsaber wielding Jedi everyday. For finishing the tougher enemies there is also a button sequence you will have to go through. I often find myself hoses as I go from madly attacking directly into the sequence with no warning. Which causes my poor guy a world of pain until I get on the right page. It also distracts from the action on screen. The boss fight sequences are some of the best of the whole game and its easy to be caught up watching the action and miss hitting the right button.I experienced a number of glitches during my playthroughs as well. I managed to get stuck in walls several times. And there were a few stages I wasn't able to force manipulate items needed to complete the stage. For the latter issues I was forced to quit my game and load it again to sort out the issue. Not too bad but with the poor save system it could mean playing through the entire stage again.Overall I did enjoy my time with Force Unleashed and will probably take a couple more play troughs. But being this game is already short I would recommend it as a rental most people. On the plus side once you do max out your character you can play through on easy and truly feel like all powerful force user you are supposed to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0000A2MCN","description":"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyis a dynamic single and multiplayer action experience featuring an all-new epic story. Players are immersed in the role of apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy where they learn the power - and danger - of the Force. Amidst a multitude of complex and richly detailed Star Wars environments, including twice as many unique locales as those inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast, players face a variety of powerful and insidious enemies.For the first time in a Jedi Knight series game,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academyallows players to create and customize their own characters by choosing various characteristics including species, gender, clothing, and physical attributes such as hair and facial features. In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color. As apprentices progress in their training, different lightsabers will become available, such as the double-bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academybegins shortly after the conclusion of events inStar Wars: Jedi Outcast. Players create a Jedi apprentice character and join the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to learn the ways of the Force under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn. While the young apprentice embarks on various missions to hone their skills and abilities, a mysterious group is discovered creating havoc throughout the galaxy. Until order is restored, the fate of the Jedi Academy - and the future of the Star Wars galaxy itself - hangs precariously in the balance.While players are able to accomplish more by using the lightsaber inStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they also will have a variety of weapons - new and old - at their disposal including a blaster, blaster rifle, Wookiee bowcaster, Imperial repeater, and a Destructive Electro-Magnetic Pulse gun. A unique level selection system allows players to choose their own path through the game as well as the missions they undertake to improve their Jedi skills. The game adds new multiplayer modes and bring back the most popular modes fromStar Wars: Jedi Outcast.","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Jedi Outcast Addon Pack","reviewText":"This is essentially an add-on pack intended for fans of the original.Fans have always been creating their own game levels and mods since Dark Forces 2, but what keeps people buying the LucasArts add-ons is that they are always so much better than fan-created levels. The runaway tram level in this game is one example.Pros:- JA has some exceptional new levels with new locations to explore.- More jedi powers and moves- Ability to customize your own padawan.Cons:- You don't really feel like part of the academy. I remember in Wing COmmander, you really felt like you were part of the team because you got to go on missions with them and talk to them. In JA, you spend most of your time alone or with Kyle.- Each mission feels like an add-on module rather than part of a whole story.If you have played thru all of the Katarn series, you will probably like this one too. It doesn't add much new but it is still quite enjoyable after a long day at work to come home and choke a few stormtroopers and Force push them off a ledge :)But I think the next generation of the series has to innovate the game significantly to keep the fans interested. Perhaps a series of training levels, like in a less tedious version of Kengo, that will allow you to increase your force powers and build your own saber fighting style, would be good. THen you could practice them in a Jedi Dojo.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A sturdy Capcom title packed full of multiplayer fun","reviewText":"Tatsunoko VS. Capcom, the latest addition to Capcom's VS. series, seemed highly unlikely to ever reach western shores, but come January 2010 and we American gamers at last have the pleasure of experiencing this (mostly) awesome game. More or less a sequel to the highly successful Marvel VS. Capcom games, Tatsunoko VS. Capcom cobbles together characters from anime production studio Tatsunoko (likely best known in America for Speed Racer, none of whose characters are present in this game, ironically, surely due to licensing issues) and popular game publisher Capcom in an arcade-style crossover fighting game.Having only previously experienced the Marvel VS. Capcom series in arcades myself, I headed into this game assuming it would be little more than endless nonsensical button-mashing, but thankfully the wide array of controller options it offers (naturally, being a Wii game) allows the player to essentially customize their playing style to whatever he or she feels comfortable with. The Classic Controller gives the most classic experience and is more or less the best bet for those highly familiar with Capcom's technical, elaborate style of playing, but for newbies and those a little more familiar with the Super Smash Bros. style of battling (particularly, feeling a little more in control of your moveset and easily pulling off specific attacks) should stick with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. The basic premise of the game is to select a duo of combatants to bash opposing teams into oblivion-or more accurately, until their health reaches zero. There is a versus mode which allows for 2 players (just a heads up, no more than 2 people can play this game at once, unless you're planning on passing around controllers) to battle in customizable settings, a 1-player mode in which you must fight a series of duels leading up to a boss fight and is also customizable, a training mode to practice, and an online mode in which you can fight friends or random people using Nintendo Wi-Fi.The versus and online modes are the two players will likely be getting the most enjoyment out of, so if you haven't got an internet connection or friends interested in playing this with you, you may want to think twice about purchasing it. The primary 1-player mode, Arcade, is fun but repetitive, and although there are a small handful of other single-player modes which allow you to see how many battles of progressively increasing difficulty you can make it through or require you to finish fights within allotted amounts of time, it ultimately all kind of just adds up to the same experience, which is one that gets vaguely tiresome after a certain amount of time. The good news is, as in many fighting games, there is a vast array of goodies and unlockables you can nab after accomplishing certain tasks in the game, and a good majority of these are unlocked by progressing through the 1-player modes. You will be able to gain new character outfits, game artwork, short movies, and of course hidden characters (there are a total of 4, all of whom can be unlocked moderately easily, which is both a good and a bad thing, since they tend to be the only unlockables casual gamers will care about).Anyone familiar with fighting games should pick up the basic Wii Remote or Wii Remote + Nunchuk controller schemes fairly quickly, but using anything else brings a bit more of a learning curve. Becoming truly good at this game requires the knowledge (and proper use) of advanced techniques like Baroque combos, Variable Air Raids, Assists, Variable Counters, and more, all of which are explained in the instruction booklet but will on average take a little time and practice for certain players to pick up.TvC offers a vast array of playable characters, and minus perhaps Tatsunoko's Speed Racer, it's unlikely that anyone will complain about any characters or series not being accounted for. The game boasts three Mega Man characters (Zero, Roll, and the man himself, albeit in his Mega Man Legends' Volnutt form), three Street Fighter characters (Ryu, Chun-Li and Alex), Darkstalkers' Morrigan, Viewtiful Joe, and more. Most American players won't be familiar with many of the Tatsunoko offerings, and although some of the anime characters may seem goofy at first, they are in fact bursting with personality and bring a lot to the gameplay, and may actually garner players' interests in checking out some of the hilarious, action-packed and incredibly cool shows from which they originate.One of the most relevant aspects of the gameplay and an essential factor of winning matches-particularly against more skilled adversaries-is the combo. Whether it's the basic combo or air combo, both of which string together an inescapable series of attacks when executed correctly, or the Hyper Combo, a super-move which comes at a price but can deal massive amounts of damage, combos are the key to finishing off opponents in TvC. Throughout matches, your characters will build up `meter' as they land hits and take damage, which will allow them to execute different moves but will primarily be saved for Hyper Combos and the Mega Crash. 1 meter allows characters to execute basic Hyper Combos, while 3 will allow them to pull off their final Hyper Combo, which generally deals massive damage (and comes with a spiffy cutscene animation) if it hits. Mega Crashing is a technique that can be hugely helpful but must be used with extreme caution-if you're caught in a long combo of damaging attacks and find yourself unable to retaliate, you can Mega Crash to break any opponent's combo (except Hypers) and send them flying to the other side of the screen. This comes at a steep price, however-upon Mega Crashing, you will lose 2 meter and a small portion of health. Learning and making proper use of all the available techniques are key to winning online and truly mastering this game.On the negative side, as with most fighting games, some of the characters feel cheap and disproportionately overpowered, occasionally making for obnoxious gameplay mechanics and match outcomes (spamming moves that pack too much power, too much range, or too much speed-or all of the above-like Ryu's Hadouken, Saki's endless slew of projectiles, and several of Tekkaman Blade and Zero's moves, is an unfortunate commonality in certain online matches). Meanwhile, the 'giant' characters, Gold Lightan and PTX-40A, are a little ridiculous and really rob battles of their strategic elements and fun-you generally just feel like you're fighting a boss when you're fighting these two, and although they do have some specific weaknesses, if you're not prepared for them you're completely and utterly screwed, which can make things obnoxious during certain online ventures. Also, some of the assets of the Japanese version sadly weren't carried over-many of the mini-games were scrapped, and instead of a fully animated short movie upon completing Arcade mode with different characters, we're given a moderately cool but significantly less satisfying slideshow of pictures.On the plus side, the artwork for this game is absolutely gorgeous; the stills and pictures offered throughout the instruction booklet, box, and as purchasable goodies in the game store are anime-style art at its very best. The in-game graphics, on the other hand, aren't quite as satisfying, but that's a given, since this is after all a Wii game. For a Wii game, however, the characters and backgrounds do look detailed and pleasing enough, and it also boasts rich, vibrant colors and scenery throughout. Arguably the game's biggest asset is its online experience-it really offers what Super Smash Bros. Brawl should have; the online mode is mostly lag-free, allows for free battles for less competitive types as well as ranked battles which allow players to progress through different rankings and fight progressively more skilled opponents. There's also a leaderboard which displays the best of the best, and you even have the option of registering worthy adversaries you come across online on your friend roster so you may battle them again at your leisure. Overall, TvC is a great gamer's experience and a general must-have for fans of fighting games-and like all good games of its type, it has loads of fun to offer to both inexperienced beginners and seasoned veterans alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

When the Gamecube was first announced it seemed that it would be a fierce competitor to the Xbox and the PS2.  It had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems.  Sadly over time, the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatform.The Gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard CD sized discs.  This has its pros and cons.  It gives GC games a faster loading time than the PS2 and Xbox but it prevents CDs and DVDs from being loaded into the tray.  Minidiscs only hold 1.5gb of data while a standard DVD holds 4.9gb.  This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube.  Now you know why you're seeing so many games that come out on both PS2 and Xbox but not the Cube.  The choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting Nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the N64.As for the control design, the Cube's controller is pretty good.  It looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the Xbox controller.  However, when it comes to controllers Sony has dominated that territory with its more simple, yet effective design.As for online gaming there isn't anything available other than Phantasy Star Online.  A couple of years ago Nintendo stated that gamers didn't care about playing games online.  They have since retracted that statement and ironically the Nintendo Revolution is expected to have online capabilities.As far as graphics go, the Gamecube has the edge over the PS2.  The Gamecube is capable of Dreamcast quality rendering which the PS2 doesn't have and has 640x480 resolution like the Xbox and Dreamcast.The games department is where the Gamecube fails miserably.  The Gamecube has a smaller library than the Xbox (even though they were launched around the same date) and the PS2's library trumps both systems.  If you like lots of great fighting games, sports games, action games, or RPGs then look elsewhere.  One can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the Cube.  Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s.  Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18.  Developers like Capcom, Sega, Square, and Namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of Japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the Cube.  As a result, many former Gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the Xbox and PS2.  Over the past year the number of games being released on the Cube has dropped significantly.  I hate to say it but it seems as if the system is already dying out and Nintendo's next-gen console isn't even close to being released yet.While it has better graphical capability than the PS2 and is more affordable than both other systems, the Gamecube has been crippled by its poor game library.  I came up on the NES and SNES but with 2 failed systems in a row, I have to say that I will not purchase another Nintedo console.  What really disappoints me is the fact that Nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the 80s and 90s (who made the NES/SNES sucessful) and continues to cater to the younger crowd.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2006"}

Lets get this out of the way first off - Story mode is very short, and can be beat in one night if you fly through it. That's not to say it's disappointing, however. Several new aspects are introduced to us through story mode, and the level of innovation really gets you excited for the possibilities in the new Community levels. That's where this game shines, and why it's worth the price of admission. The Create and Community features were pretty impressive in the first LBP, but they're flat-out incredible in this second installment. Virtually every improvement I could think of was implemented - the folks at Media Molecule really did pay attention to what the community wanted.One of the biggest improvements is the new music creator. In LBP 1, many people made community levels specifically for the user to ride through on an automobile of some sort to play the notes of a song. It was interesting for a while but got repetitive, and we knew there had to be a way to include an actual music creator to create background music for our levels. Well, now we got it, and it's all there - virtually every instrument and sound you can think of, to recreate your favorite song or create a new masterpiece, and insert it as the background music for your level. This is just one of many improvements made to the Create feature, and already there are hundreds of impressive new Community levels to play and rate. Once users really get comfortable with the new Create features, the sky is the limit for this game.Even if you're not big on trying to learn how to create a level, the incredible amount of high quality community levels and mini games will keep you playing this for months... and if you happen to take a break from the game for a few weeks, rest assured that when you feel the urge to play again, there will be many more new levels for you to try out. Don't forget your friends, as well! All levels in story mode and community support both online and local multiplayer. The fun never ends for everyone!Because this game will keep you coming back for more time and time again, I give it my highest recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"The best installment in the GTA series","reviewText":"Back in the late 1990's a friend of mine invited me over as he found an awesome game. The game allowed you to steal cars, shoot people and just cause chaos. The game was Grand Theft Auto and it raised the bar in gaming as every sequel has been more ambitious than the previous one. Now Rockstar has raised the bar yet again with Grand Theft Auto V but is this game worth the hype?This installment goes to the state of Los Santos (which mirrors life in Southern California) but unlike it's predecessor the scope of this game is vast. From the rich neighborhoods of Rockford Hills to the sunny beaches of Vespucci Beach this has to be the biggest GTA game released to date. The single player experience follows three people as the stories are intertwined between these three individuals. A former bank robber Michael De Santa , his partner in crime Frankie Clinton and the psychopath of the group Trevor Phillips.While this might seem like a typical setting for a Grand Theft Auto game this is where the developers decided to throw all that out the window. You can plan each of the heists that you go on and decide which way to approach them. You can go in all silent and not choose to kill anyone or go loud and cause chaos in the traditional GTA sense. In these missions you can select between the three characters effortlessly. So if you are in a firefight and need some support you can switch to another character to provide sniper cover.But you might be asking what about in between missions are there things to do? There are PLENTY of things to keep you occupied in the vast environment that Rockstar has created. From exploring underwater off the coast of Vespucci Beach to taking up a round of golf there are more than enough to keep you occupied for hours and hours. And that isn't even scratching the surface on the multiplayer options as Rockstar  as you can create your crew and even transfer them over from Max Payne 3.With tons of missions, three characters to jump between and loads of content to be experienced offline as well as online it is a no brainer GTA V is one to get. For more information on this game go to [...] and get ready to have some fun in San Andreas.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

InNeed for Speed: Shift, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel.For Racers By RacersInNeed for Speed: Shift, EA has brought together some of the world's best racing game talent and real race drivers. Developed in a unique collaboration between Slightly Mad Studios--developers and designers of the critically acclaimedGT LegendsandGTR2games--Michael Mann (executive producer at Black Box) and Patrick Soderlund, senior Vice President of EA Games and part of a racing team that recently competed in the fourth edition of the TOYO Tires 24H Dubai 2009, the result is an authentic driving experience unmatched on any game system.Additional Screenshots:","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"Need for Speed Shifts in the Right Direction!","reviewText":"Need for Speed: Shift is this year's iteration of the annual Need for Speed Series.  Forgoing its dependence on the underground street racing scene, this one moves the series into the realm of simulation real world racing.  Pretty much, this game relies on the sense of speed and the forgoing of police chases, nitrous boosts, etc.Need for Speed Shift is definitely a step in the right direction for the series that people claim has been losing its thrill in recent years.  Although fans of Underground and etc may feel like a foreigner to the series when playing this game; Shift stands to appeal to fans of simulation racing.  In this game you can buy a myriad of cars, unlock them in greater tiers of races, or mod them to your hearts content.  The game has about over 50 different cars that are equivalent to their real world counterparts (with extremely detailed cockpit views).  There are also over 20 different tracks that all have a variety of race types on them.  You can take part in Drifting competitions (like the real world Drift events), car battles, races, timed laps.  A player will go through all of these events in the career mode as they work to earn money, and reach the Need for Speed World Cup.Shift excels in the presentation department.  The cockpit view is the best racing perspective in this game (there are the usual options here) for it adds an extra element of personality to it when you are in this view and the screen blurs if you crash, or if you crash quite hard your in car driver will grunt.  You are also able to see them shift gears too.  The game has damage so in this cockpit view your cars screen will crack, or you will see your hood fly off.  The tracks look amazing and one would be fooled into thinking it is an actual real life representation of the track.  For example, one wouldnt believe how much the Laguna Seca corkscrew mimics the actual real life track. The track themselves, you will see spectators waving their flags, the blurring effects look great as you pass them by as well as others.  The thrill of speed is accurately felt in this game too.  Other minor details are noticiable such as the Ferris Wheel spinning in one track too.Soundwise, the games soundtrack for in race music is set to be off by default but one can turn it on for the usual variety of picks from Electronic Arts and licensed music.  Sound effects are accurately represented and vary for each car.  If it is a low powered car then the engine will sound low powered and vice versa.  The English narrator is quite excellent in explaining various items and for items where his explanation is off, you can press L1 to hear it, such as on the customization screen when you need to upgrade the car (helpful if you dont know why you would pay $12,000 to upgrade your engine, etc).Mechanics wise, the game will start you off by having you race one practice lap to determine your settings.  These settings can range from having the racing line turned on, auto steering/auto braking turned on, and whether or not it will have your damage set to \"visual only\" or full damage in which your driving will be affected.  After doing this it will determine a difficulty setting and move you on to the career mode. In this mode there are several tears and more tiers can be unlocked by gaining stars. Stars are earned on each race by winning, meeting the points requirement, or meeting a speed threshold.  You earn points by performing \"Precision\" actions or \"Aggressive\" actions.  Which this ensures is that while everyone may not be able to achieve first place, each race will net you points for your driver profile (which is an ingame achievement system which gives you a driver level which nets you access to more money, events, and upgrades).  Precision actions are those in which you overtake an opponent without touching their car, following the race line, mastering a corner, while aggressive actions are those in which you try to ram cars off the road, spin them out of control, etc.  The AI will cater to your style as well.  You can also use the profile to search for races with other players just like you.Ultimately there is much more to Need For Speed Shift than I can put into writing, however, this game is a pretty amazing offering from EA and is a nice new direction for the Need for Speed Shift series to take.  Apart from only offering the 50+ cars, there is nothing that negative about the game.  It could even be comparable to that of GT5 Prologue, GRID, and Forza.  For the first of its kind from this developer, I would say this was an amazing undertaking that doesnt fail to please racing fans.*Controls:  I play the game using the control pad.  The control setting that is set by default may not be pleasing to most players however, in car customization and such you can undertake advance settings to change extremely meticulous settings to allow for more changes that will cause you to drive less \"jeeringly\" and more smoothly.  Try it out. A wheel would be nice to have too!Pros-Nice, new, fresh direction for Need for Speed Series-Detailed SIM racer-Detailed Car Customization-High production values-Decent DualShock 3 Controls-Love the trophies-Driver Profile is addicting-Tracks from around the world-Upgrading Tier 1 cars is rewarding in later tiers and events.Cons-People who expect police chases, traps, an \"arcadey nitrous rush\" will be disappointed-Controls take getting used to-Would have been nice to have over 100+ carsEdit: Patch 1.01 released on Sept 24, 2009, which corrects damage, offering Full Damage model being able to be turned off or on, and actually shown on the car.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2009"}

The 3D effect does give it a different look and feel, and it's challenging with hidden scenarios in stages and how to get to them.  First challenging level comes as early as World 2-2 in obtaining all Star Coins.CONSThe 3D effect takes some getting used to.  Be sure to use the minimum level of 3D if at first it feels disorienting.  I fell a lot of times, because I couldn't pinpoint where the exact landing point was where there was no shadow to guide me.Also, the reason why I gave this game a three star rating is because the wolds are SO short, and I mean really short.  Where before you'd see up to 8 levels in a world, in this game you see as little as 4 or 5.  Some levels must be unlocked but upfront it does feel a lot skimmer as compared to the New Super Mario Bros for the DS.There are new additions to Mario's powerups, but nothing really new.  For example the high jump back flip feels awkard and a little more difficult accomplish as compared to previous Mario titles with a simple movement of the Z and nunchuck stick to the other direction.  In this game Mario has to gain momentum before jumping and does not really backflip, unless I still haven't mastered the jump after playing mario games since I was 12 (a good 22 years going on 23 playing up to this point).I still have expectations for the 3DS on Mario Kart 7 and Kid Icarus Uprising.  Ocarina of Time?  Meh!  Same thing remastered.  I already have the GC title for the Wii VC.NOTE:  Had given it a ONE star, but did reconsider, for after all, I did enjoy the game, and didn't put it down until I beat it twice.

Project Gotham Racing 2 is the textbook definition of an arcade racer. It's stuffed full of the physics, modeling, real world location selection and intense competition you'd expect to find in a simulation racer, which results in something of a sim-flavored credibility, but streamlines most of the meticulous, detail-oriented specifics that usually turn off casual gamers and anyone, really, without permanent oil stains on their fingers or a rice burner in the garage. This is a game that excels at delivering the sensation that you're really behind the wheel, with the force of several hundred horses behind your right foot, but also at keeping away from the monotony and mindless repetition that's usually associated with a race of more than one or two laps.Separating it from straight sims, such as Sony's Gran Turismo titles, is PGR's heavy focus on the acquisition of \"Kudo Points.\" The driving force behind each of the two previous chapters in the Project Gotham / Metropolis series, Kudos are gathered through a variety of methods, some common and everyday, others more difficult and unpredictable, and always center on the theme of \"driving stylishly.\" In short, you're expected to drive an exciting race every single time you hit the track. While almost every other racer in the history of the industry concentrates exclusively on the clock and the ongoing pursuit of faster laps and more efficient driving, Gotham 2 places a much higher emphasis on showmanship and flashy tricks. You'll gain a flat sum of Kudos for passing an opponent's car or taking a turn properly, but more elaborate maneuvers, such as drifting wildly around a curve or catching some air, reward with higher sums depending on the duration of the trick and your willingness to go on longer and longer stretches without complete control of your vehicle. If you aren't leaving behind a patch of burnt rubber and a cloud of foul-smelling smoke, PGR wants you to think you've done something wrong.The idea is to shake up the usual formula of \"drive three identical laps and don't let anybody pass you,\" and on the large, it works. Instead of enjoying a track the first few times you drive it, then giving in to brainless replication, you'll find yourself constantly challenged and interested in a course. Actually racing is a lot more fun when you can make the most of your big lead by firing off a few donuts at the finish line or allowing the back end of your car to slide well beyond the point of good reason while taking an easy turn. The key is finding a good middle ground between a dull, straightforward race and an excessively daring, mistake-filled hunt for bigger and better tricks, since most of your opponents' cars are merely looking to win the race and couldn't care less about looking good in doing so.Actually racing in Gotham is largely very enjoyable, despite a few snags, and though it can make you almost blindingly filled with rage, there's just a certain something that keeps you coming back for more, looking to improve and show the game who's boss in the end. There's a vibe you'll get from controlling one of these cars that's difficult to put into words, something that's perhaps not immediately obvious when it's there but absolutely glaring when it's missing. It's something of a sense of reality, that feeling that you're actually moving as fast as the speedometer says you are, that your car really is as powerful as it claims. It's... well, it's really cool, for lack of a better phrase. When you accelerate in one of Gotham's more thrust-heavy high end machines, you'll feel something pressing down right in the center of your chest... that, and just a tiny bit of adrenaline.As I hinted, however, the gameplay isn't always wine and roses. There are a few aspects that leave me scratching my head, for instance the decision for the player-controlled car to always, ALWAYS begin the race in last place, without any sort of a qualifying lap or anything. You're always fighting an uphill battle, as you must work your way around the painfully slow cars that start just in front of your position while the speedy pole-sitter gets a chance to create as much distance between himself and your car as possible.One area in which Gotham 2 really makes its case as a front-running title is the amazing variety of its maps and race tracks. You'll find yourself globe trotting from Moscow to Barcelona to Sydney and back, driving on tracks that vary in length from excessively minute to inexplicably long. Seriously, one course allows the driver to finish four laps in under three minutes, while another demands fifteen minutes of dedication per lap! The environments are incredibly lush and detail heavy, and each course is allowed several different racing layouts, providing endless hours of replay value on courses that look similar at a glance, but are laid out completely differently.In \"Kudos World Series\" mode, rather than giving players a course, a rundown of opposing cars and a quick \"good luck,\" Gotham shakes up the status quo by not only introducing a few new (and almost universally successful) game types, but by making them an integral part of the single player experience, to boot. As you'll progress through \"World Series\" mode, you'll work your way through a healthy mix of seven different spins on the traditional gameplay model. Each variation seems to emphasize one aspect of becoming a successful driver in the straightforward street races, which remain the bread and butter of individual play, and surprisingly enough, none come across as forced, unnecessary or aggravating.The multiplayer aspect of the game is a nice addition, if occasionally underdeveloped, but should never be mistaken for the star of the show. The online multiplayer does allow for more than straightforward head-to-head matches, but could have done with a little more thought when all is said and done. The actual system of joining a race online is a tedious, boring affair. You'll find a room with slots available for more racers, find that a race is more than likely already in progress, and then find yourself relegated to observing the remainder of the race from a stale, overhead map with tiny colored squares to indicate the location of each car. There's no fly-by observation mode, or really any kind of visual flair in the slightest. If you have the misfortune of attempting to join an excessively lengthy race just after it's started, your options are either to stare vacantly at the screen for upwards of ten minutes or drop out of the room and look for another race. In short, the multiplayer mode is quite weak and borderline unfinished, which stands in sharp contrast to the polished, beautiful nature of the single player game it accompanies. Very disappointing, and something that brought my opinion of the game down a notch or two.The amount of work that went into every visual aspect of this game is obvious from the very first moment you boot up. Everything from the menus to the surroundings to, obviously, the vehicles themselves is unspeakably gorgeous. It's a shame the HD output is limited to 480p, because I can't even imagine the kind of impact this would've had at 720p or 1080i. The little touches are what grabbed me the most: they didn't have to include that flock of birds, flying ignorantly over the roads, or that enormous, spindly ferris wheel off in the distance, but they did, and they take unprecedented steps toward furthering the illusion that you're actually there, in person, participating in these races. Nothing about this game's visuals seem forced, even areas that have provided nightmares in other games. The glares and reflections off your car's exterior, which could've very easily been tacky and overdone, seem just right. My sole complaint is that the dynamic lighting is sometimes too realistic, as it occasionally becomes difficult to see where you're going when racing among the long, dark shadows of a dusk-time race. PGR2 is just a gorgeous bit of digitized visual realization, something that set the bar way too high for any competition to even hope to match.In summary... well, I'll say this in no uncertain terms; this game is a hell of a lot of fun. The controls are simple, easy to comprehend and staggeringly easy to pick up on. The courses, set in landmark cities throughout North America, Europe and Asia, are challenging and varied without completely throwing the player for a loop every time they load a new track. The incline of opposition is steep, progressing upwards from relatively simple-minded Sunday drivers to blood-hungry maniacs who know exactly what they want and precisely how to get it. Even the gameplay, which is largely relegated to simple \"race against the computer or race against your friends\" in other titles, gets a breath of life here, in the form of half a dozen different modes of play. It lacks the fine, fine details of tuning a racing auto to perfection, but seeing as how I'm not all that intrigued by that aspect of the business as it is, I didn't miss those options one bit. If the multiplayer mode had been just a little more well-developed, I'd be giving this one a nearly perfect rating, but as it is right now it's still far above average. This one is definitely worth adding to your collection if you have even the slightest interest in driving a car around a track at insane speeds, and remains one of the most visually stimulating experiences I've enjoyed in gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2006"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"phoongdan","summary":"A near-perfect game...","reviewText":"It's hard for me to fathom how someone can not love this game if you enjoy the RE series or are into the horror genre. Reading some of the negative reviews, yes it would be nice to be able to carry a few more items. I liked in RE4 that you were able to upgrade your suitcase as you went along so you could carry more items. I wish they would have implemented that in RE5. Yes, the game play is similar to RE4, should it not be? RE4 was an awesome game for the PS2 (I actually played it on the Cube), so I think Capcom did the right thing by not changing too much for RE5. The setting changes from Spain to Africa, so of course the environments change, but the game play and feel is virtually unchanged from RE4. Personally, I liked that. Really I have no complaints of this game that would have me rate it anything less than 5 stars. The game was not too difficult on the normal setting though it of course got more challenging in the last chapter, as expected. Personally, a minor critique is that in RE4 there were little side games you got to play while you were doing the main game - remember the shooting galleries? Those were fun, and I wish they would have done that in RE5 too. But what I liked better about RE5 is I thought the whole RE story comes much more into focus in RE5 and I really liked the addition of the Tricell company and that whole angle. Some of the research/labs sets were awesome!And I was surprised there were so many complaints about the AI for Sheeva. I have played many other games where the AI was just awful (I love the SOCOM series, but can't tell you how many times those fools in Bravo company wouldn't budge when I gave them an order or they'd get stuck trying to walk into a tree!), and I found Sheeva quite helpful on a few occasions. In fact, I think she saved me more than I saved her!I take people's point about the series moving from being more focused on horror to action. I didn't play all of the earlier games, but I did play RE-0 and I agree that was a creepier game than RE4 or RE5. However, I feel as though whatever the series lost in creepiness, it more than makes up for in action & a well-developed storyline.Not much you can say about the graphics except WOW! This was my first game played on the PS3 and what an upgrade from the PS2! Fantastic. If you have enjoyed the RE series in the past you should love this one too.Re: The Mercenaries (unlockable game): The Mercenaries was also featured in RE4 and is brought back here for RE5. I love this game maybe even more than the main game! It's a very familiar format to RE4 with some different characters. I recommend you purchase the extra chapter for RE5, \"Lost in Nightmares\" - this will not only get you an extra chapter to play in the RE5 game (it's where Chris & Jill go to the Spencer mansion and confront Wesker), but it will also get you an alternate version of Mercenaries called \"Mercenaries Reunion\" with characters Excella and Barry (leader of Alpha team). You can also purchase Character Pack I and II for $1.99 each on the PS Network and pick up additional costumes for Chris & Sheeva. The Lost in Nightmares is $5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

Something rarely seen on the Wii except maybe by the big publishers and even then it has mixed results.The combat while somewhat confusing at 1st is simple yet very fun. It seems to mix Gears of Wars with Japanese RPG elements.The Graphics are amazing. Hard to believe the Wii could do that but then you see the bad framerate during cut scenes and gameplay and it reminds you of the limited power of the Wii. While annoying at times I personally appreciate the effort put into the graphics and for them pushing the little white system to it's limits. Some scenes are breath taking.Music is beautiful and appropriate with some catchy tunes.What really gets you hooked though is the Characters and story. The characters while nothing special are fun and charming and the story simple enough and to the point that it doesn't get in it's own way or you are bored with tons and tons of background story and exposition like other RPG's. The voice acting is great and the accents add to the charm.The hours fly by with this game and I like the main romance in the game.This game needed a more polish for it to truly be elite. The aiming needed the Wii pointer and the frame rate is far from stable and there are rough edges but even then the game is entertaining and a great experience.

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Robert evans","summary":"Jak III is gonna' rule.....","reviewText":"Having played and beatin Jak II I read the cover story onJak III and it is looking to be the best Jak game ever.Jak is once again arrested and taken to a wasted city far fromHaven city.

Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"A Good Game But Ultimately Too Easy.","reviewText":"Enslaved: Odyssey To The West is a good game but ultimately I found the experience somewhat disappointing as it could have been so much better. My biggest problem with this game is that it was simply too easy and this is a problem I see with a lot of the games released these days. Developers make the games easier so they appeal to a broader market and in turn make more money. Don't get me wrong, some games should be aimed at this, more casual, segment of the gaming population. The problem is that we are now seeing a disproportional amount of games made this way and that leaves hard core gamers who are looking for a real challenge very few places too go.Enslaved is actually worse than most in this regard as one of the games key play mechanics, that of climbing around on things, is basically death proof. You literally cannot fall off of ledges even if you try as Monkey, the main character you control, comes to a screeching halt and does this little \"almost lost my balance\" routine before stopping. It really takes what could have been one of the games funnest elements and turns it into a button mashing routine that requires absolutely zero skill whatsoever. Think Prince of Persia: Sands of Time taken to the extreme. All that is required is that you point in the right direction and push a button and Monkey jumps from ledge to ledge without any proper timing or skill required. Also, despite the convincing look of the game's rather large environments, the game is completely linear, and Monkey's course is always perfectly clear.One of the best aspects to this game is the cut scenes and interaction between the two main characters. Its one of the better games released this year in this regard. Its well scripted and for the most part you actually care about the characters and the story that is being told. Its really a AAA game in this regard and ultimately this really makes the weaker aspects of the game more disappointing as its apparent to anyone who plays this that this could have been and should have been an all around AAA game. It was the poor choice of making it easy and thus appealing to a broader market that ultimately takes the AAA status away from this game.The combat is fun but ultimately it also suffers from being too easy. Once you learn the mechanics all you have to do is block followed by a wide clearing sweep attack when the enemies move in and then follow that up with a powerful attack on one of the enemies and finally rinse and repeat. This will take out 95% of the games enemies with ease and I was playing the hardest skill level. I didn't even try the lower difficulty settings so I cant even imagine how easy it is at those skill levels. Of course there are the boss fights and turret stages to help mix things up and for the most part the boss fights are the most challenging aspect to the game and in turn the most entertaining.Ultimately Enslaved: Odyssey To The West is a good game but it could have been so much more. Some aspects are without a doubt AAA quality while others are.....well, without a doubt not AAA quality. Casual gamers will no doubt find this game far more enjoyable than hardcore gamers after all, this is who the game was designed for. Had they made a deeper fighting system and gotten rid of the automated/rail climbing mechanics, this game would have been vastly superior. The good news is that the story is so well done that it really makes up for a lot of the games bigger problems and ultimately it makes this game an enjoyable venture. I would give this game a 3.5 stars out of 5 but since Amazons grading system doesn't allow for half point increments, I rounded it up and gave it 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2011"}

Not even close. I think after the infamous teaser trailer, I pretty much got it in my head that the game would end up being a really \"meaningful\" zombie experience. All the themes of a really good zombie flick spread out over the canvas of an open world video game. Desperation, survival, and banding together to keep the horde at bay. A game with a great story, a lot of opportunities to explore, memorable characters. I don't know, I was really hoping for the moon.But the opening moments of the game have you waking up from a bad night of partying and running around a zombified island resort at the behest of \"The Voice,\" all the while collecting teddy bears, champagne, etc. All of this done for a group of quest-givers who seem to believe self-sufficiency is taboo. All the while, people are referring to you as if you were more than one person, as though the developers were outright opposed to making a game that allows for a seamless singleplayer experience. No, DEAD ISLAND is all over the place in terms of what it does well, what it is, and what it's trying to be.Despite all of that, it does indeed do some things very well, but I'm gonna go over the bad stuff first.Disappointingly, there's not much of a story here. In the beginning, what appears to be a struggle to escape the infected island of Banoi quickly tailspins into a convoluted mess of sidequests involving everything, from the aforementioned teddy bears to delivering supplies to arranging luggage into a giant \"HELP\" sign on the beachhead. There's a lot going on in this game and not a lot of it's connected to the whole escape-the-island plan. I'll be darned if your character won't be the most unfocused survivor on the island.That's not to say that the sidequests aren't fun or interesting from time to time, but in an RPG (especially a zombie RPG) you can't help but find yourself wondering, \"What would I do in this situation?\" Would I make a run out to an abandoned gas station to bring back food for my fellow survivors? Probably. Would I fight off a zombie horde to reclaim a teddy bear? Probably/definitely not. It's a funny quest, and there's certainly room in this game for good humor, but there are many, many quests that seem so out of the realm of possibility that I had to stop myself a few times and question, \"Why am I doing this?\" Why do these quest-givers seem so indifferent about sending me out into Zombieland so many times for odd little reasons?But then again, DEAD ISLAND is not trying to be FALLOUT or OBLIVION; unfortunately, it's trying to be BORDERLANDS. That is to say, the entire game is built around its co-op mode, to the point that all four selectable characters will pop up in all of the cutscenes regardless of who you choose to play. NPCs will constantly refer to you as though you're in a group and you may be constantly hit with notices that pop up when you're playing in the same area as someone else online. Now, I love BORDERLANDS, but it's tough to play games that generally feel less-than-whole if you don't have a buddy to play with right then and there. I would have greatly preferred the game to have a strong singleplayer element with co-op as an option.You might also notice that if you do choose to play a solo game, DEAD ISLAND will not show you any mercy just because you don't have backup. I can't believe I'm saying this, but there were too many zombies in this game. Running around the different parts of Banoi quickly becomes a chore when different quests have you crisscrossing through veritable walls of the undead. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the zombies didn't respawn as soon as you leave the area, but as it stands, you might just fight the same group of undead several times as you sprint from quest to guest-giver and back again.Having zombies absolutely everywhere makes exploration seem unappealing, which is very, very disappointing, since developer Techland made sure there was no shortage of places to seek out and loot. But in my case, the thought of tackling additional walls of zombies on top of what I was already dealing with in the main storyline was very off-putting. (My stats say I killed over 1000 of one type of zombie during my first, semi-rushed playthrough.) I thought that maybe once I got up there in levels, going back and poking around all the places I missed wouldn't be such a bad idea, but that was quickly shot down. I'm not sure why this is becoming a trend among most RPGs these days, but I don't find it very fun when the enemies' level scales to your own. So going back to places where you'd just fought 4th level zombies, you will now find 20th or 30th level zombies, depending on your own level.I can absolutely understand enemies getting more difficult to kill as the story goes on, but I can't for the life of me figure out why everything else has to progress with you. So we end up with an RPG where progression and improvement amounts to just barely keeping your head above the water.So where does that leave us? Well, taking into account the many graphical glitches and the odd quest bug you're likely to run into, I would put the game at around 3.5 stars as an objective rating. Definitely do some research and see if this co-op-centric game is what you were expecting. But personally, despite all of that, I did have a really good time, because DEAD ISLAND is a very big step in the right direction in terms of the zombie game of my dreams.Banoi, for all its social imperfections, is an absolutely gorgeous place. Walking outside for the first time edged very close to that OBLIVION or FALLOUT moment, when the whole world (island) is in front of you, and there are so many possibilities. Everything is just so competently designed. The beach resort feels like a place you'd want to visit, the town feels lived-in, and the inland jungle is easy to get lost in (literally and figuratively). It's all very top-notch, so much so that I was hoping for a lull in the attacks so I could do some decent exploring, but that kinda gets derailed by the \"Infected\" class of zombie, which spawns in packs only a few yards away from you, no matter where you are.And even though the quests can run the gamut, there were many that were well thought-out and written, and some that completely capitalized on the post-apocalyptic setting. (Who wouldn't want to ride around in a reinforced armored car or run around abandoned shops?)DEAD ISLAND was a rollercoaster ride of post-apocalyptic wish-fulfillment, amazing visuals, and wasted potential. What could've been the OBLIVION of zombie RPGs ended up being the BORDERLANDS of zombie RPGs, where the story and gameplay all show signs of being compromised in order to make co-op the absolute focus. But even with that working against it, this game is still one of the best zombie titles out there. It's not quite the zombie game I've always wanted, but it's certainly gotten closer than anything else on the market.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"4.5 stars...the spiritual successor to Goldeneye N64","reviewText":"Wow...this game brings back a lot of great memories. :)This game is the reason why you bought an N64, 4 controllers and bothered with investing in the Expansion Pack to unlock the entire game itself. This is Perfect Dark...the spiritual successor to Goldeneye. Rare was the company behind such favorites as Donkey Kong 64, the Banjo Kazooie games, Jet Force Gemini and Diddy Kong Racing. Perfect Dark set out to be better than Goldeneye and provide everything that you needed in a first person shooter. They succeeded and went beyond that.Perfect Dark was released in 2000 and you control Joanna Dark, a secret agent who sets out to investigate a shady corporation and it is set in the future. It packed twice the punch of Goldeneye in the way of better graphics, awesome music, smarter A.I. (pretty impressive at the time), better weapons and nearly limitless customization of multiplayer matches and fun multiplayer modes. Perfect Dark was so much fun to play, with or without your friends.The single player mode has a great story and keeps you motivated while playing through it. The graphics and sounds are great. The enemies are smarter than in Goldeneye and depending on the level of difficulty will bring the fight to you. The music sets the mood and keeps you going as you shoot the enemies. The 2 player cooperative mode has you taking on the enemies with a friend and with the split screen you can take out objectives together or opt to pick out which objectives you and your friend to do and meet with them somewhere else in the stage. It works very well. The 2 player counter-operative mode puts a twist on the 2 player coop mode: the first player takes control of Joanna while the second player takes control of an enemy walking around in the stage you choose to play. The 2nd player must take out the 1st player by any means necessary. If the first player eliminates the second player, then the second player assumes control of another enemy in that same stage and tries to eliminate the first player etc. etc.The multiplayer modes are the reasons you keep on playing after you beat the main game. You can customize just about anything: the music, the number of players, the time limit, the kill limit, weapons you can use, the character you use (as well as the name and attributes), handicap settings and the number of simulants (the bot controlled characters) as well as the difficulty level and role of the simulants itself.So many great things to say about this game but there is one flaw that made me give it 4.5 stars...the graphics get crazy ass choppy when there is a lot of action going on. This is especially true when you have 4 human players and 8 bots playing in the same match or when you get punched in the face as the screen gets blurry to mimic your vision after it happens to you in real life. If you don't have it and you love FPSs, get this game and be sure to have the expansion pack or you won't get to play everything. ********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Who knew a bow could be this much fun?","reviewText":"You can't go too wrong with giving the player a suit packed with all sorts of fun toys like stealth, super-strength, super-speed, hacking abilities, etc. and not expect them to have fun. At its core Crysis 3 is built around giving the player a big playground to play around in where they feel both powerful but still vulnerable enough to keep the challenge up. One of the big additions of this game is the new compound bow and it is just an absolute joy to use. In fact I almost exclusively used the bow without relying on guns at all. Mostly because the bow was just that much fun to use. And it introduces some new tactical elements since though the bow is a 1-shot wonder, it's not very common to find new arrows. So you have to sneak around to go get the arrows you've already used on fallen enemies.The alien Ceph also introduce their own unique challenge and keep the action exciting and fresh with a mix of enemy types. I don't think the overall story is anything too memorable personally, but I can easily overlook that just given how much fun it is to play through all the various action scenes. They easily carry the game and are what sell it. The multi-player is alright, though to be honest I didn't spend much time on it just because of other games I wanted to play. Its all pretty standard from what I could tell with deathmatch and the like, but with a couple unique ones with mercenaries vs. a crysis-suit player. If you want to be a super-powered cyborg with an even cooler bow to go hunting with, definitely consider picking up this game. I guarantee the first time you go hunting with the bow you'll have a smile on your face.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"PT Cruiser","summary":"A great way to exercise","reviewText":"I've only had my Wii Fit for a little over a week, but I'm addicted to it already.  The first thing I do each morning is weigh myself on it.  It has a very accurate scale, down the a tenth of a pound, even on carpeting.  It always has encouragement and I can see my daily progress on a chart.The exercises are divided into four groups:  aerobic, yoga, balance and strength.  My favorites are the balance games and the yoga.  I love seeing if I can beat my previous scores on the short games and end up trying them over and over.  The yoga is more difficult than I had imagined, but I've never taken a real yoga lesson so maybe that's why.Some things I really like about the Wii Fit is that I can do my weigh in first thing in the morning and then do the training later.  And if I only have time for 15 minutes of exercise, I can come back later in the day and it will add the additional minutes to my total time.  Sometimes I end up using it 2 or 3 times a day.  And there is a place to add exercise other than the Wii Fit games and training into the log.  I really like having an accurate picture of what I've done each day and what I weigh without having to worry about writing it down.The interface is so darn cute!  I love the little voice that says, \"3,2,1 measuring!\"  This product is motivating in a way that other methods aren't.  Some of the exercises aren't that strenuous, but you can always add a walk, run or an aerobics DVD to your exercise log.A nice \"game\" or group of small games that compliment the Wii Fit is the Active Life Outdoor Challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00DHF39KS","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Love/Hate","reviewText":"I love the action, story, weapons and overall concept.  This is a fun shooter that also incorporates elements of stealth.  Graphics are decent but more PS3 than \"next-gen\" looking.  In general, it's a fun game and I don't regret the purchase one bit.  It is also the only game in my PS4 library (which is over a half dozen games at this point) that I've played not once, not twice, but three times already.  So, replay value is very high.  All in all, it is probably the most fun game I've purchased so far.However....This game can be hard, and not in a good way.  It is way too difficult at times and that difficulty starts almost immediately.  A combination of occasionally poor camera angles, terrible (as in practically non-existent) ammo monitoring/alert system, auto-aiming that does more harm than good, and sometimes whacky controls can induce a controller smashing rage in no time at all.  Throw in ruthlessly distant checkpoints and you'll find yourself like I have numerous times: ready to hurl the PS4 controller through the 60-inch screen after wasting ten minutes slaughtering two dozen enemy soldiers and a handful of heavily armored and armed robots, only to have some little cowardly guard or commander dart out and finish you off with one shot because you have like 5% health left after the battle.  Sometimes the game will get really cruel and just send an entire new wave after a particularly hard battle with not nearly enough food and ammo for you in comparison top the enemy.Now, it wouldn't be too bad if the checkpoints weren't so ridiculously spaced and the game so unrelentingly cheap at times.  Like, did I mention that the enemies seem to know your every move and always seem to time a full out assault perfectly as soon you run out of ammo or get critically low on health?  If you try to take cover and fight with some type of strategy, then they'll usually just lob grenades at you until you die or finally give up and come out into the open armed with 19 bullets against twenty foes.  As I mentioned earlier, it doesn't help matters that the game does an absolutely terrible job of alerting you when you are out of ammo.  Another extremely irritating quirk is the strict rail system. This is gaming by numbers where familiarity and memorization win. The enemies will attack in the same manner, same pattern always.  Once in a blue moon, an action that YOU take will alter their attack, but if you confront them the same way, they will attack the same way. My last gripe is the programming.  There are some serious bugs in this game.  The most loathed issue, at least by me, is the terrible navigation and environmental detection AI. I've lost count of how many times my character had to just sit there completely exposed because he couldn't jump up a two foot embankment to take cover. I think this may be a nasty byproduct of the play by numbers rail system because this anomaly usually happens when I try to backtrack to scoop up items I attempt to preserve during one of the many one against 500 men, ten virtually indestructible robots, cyborg dogs and even regular foot soldiers who seem to withstand an increasingly startling amount of damage before falling.  I lobbed three grenades and pumped 5 shotgun rounds into one so-called regular soldier, not even one of the hulking iron-clad monstrosities that are supposed to stake tons of damage.  He STILL did not fall.  In fact, one of the so-called boss soldiers was ten times easier and quicker to kill than the regular soldier.  Did the damage detection AI get screwed up or something?  A couple other quirks are the ammo wheel (make sure you look at the arrow, not the highlight. Can't tell you how many times I've chosen the wrong weapon in the heat of battle because the weapon being highlighted is independent of the arrow pointing to the weapon.Now, with all that said, the game is still extremely fun and highly addictive. I simply can't stop playing.  Do I think you should buy it?  Sure.  Just invest in some of those Wii strap thingies and maybe a soothing cup of relaxing tea before playing.  Unless you're a Wolfenstein master or just one of those lucky people with nothing but endless hours of free time per day to devote to mastering FPS, this game WILL tick you off several times eventually due to cheapness.  May not hurt to take a blood pressure pill or two before playing as well...  Excellent game, all out fun but definitely infuriatingly frustrating at times.  It has greatly increased my vocabulary of things I can call a game out of anger.  It's a great game but it could have been a class if it were more -evenly balanced and some of these glitches were patched.  Seriously, unable to jump up a two foot embankment to get to cover, so BJ has to stand there getting blasted because he's surrounded on every side and that two-foot embankment is the only clear area????  Lame...*July 12 update*Now, the more you play, the better you become at overcoming these little obstacles.  That is also what helps make the replay value so high.  Now that I have a good feel for the mechanics and the game engine, this elite glitches have become less bothersome.  However, they were infuriating on the first play through.  I waffled on my original rating, giving it a three-star because I was so mad at the initial shortcomings.  However, After playing the game several times, I still want to play it when I need a quick adrenaline fix.  No other game in my library has that kind of attraction.One last note regarding a choice you will be forced to make at the beginning of the game.  I won't spoil it with specifics but you will need to nod to either your left or your right.  If you are a newbie like me, I strongly suggest you nod to the right.  The basic differences of the choices are as follows:Nodding to the right will give you health upgrades which are permanent once unlocked.  Your health capacity will stay the same for the entire game.  It also gives you the ability to hot wire items.Nodding to the left will give you armor upgrades which increase the amount of armor you acquire by 10% with each upgrade.  For instance, after the first upgrade, if you pick up what was previously a 10+ upgrade, it will become an 11+ upgrade.  The problem is, unlike the health upgrades, it neither increases the total amount of armor you can wear at once (it always stays at 100%) nor is it permanent.  In fact, sometimes, I lost armor between chapters whereas when I played with the health upgrade, I never lost health.The story stays basically the same with a few necessary minor changes based on your choice but they are very minor.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2014"}

I'm not going to go into the specifics inside the PS3 as one reviewer did it perfectly.Take away my Nintendo Wii and the last gaming console that I own, is the Xbox (the original one). I saw the demonstrations of both next generation gaming consoles at Best Buy. I was amazed at both. Basically, if you don't own a Blu-Ray player, you might want to buy a PS3 instead of a stand alone Blu-Ray player (that's if you are a gamer also). This PS3 model doesn't accept most PS2 games (very few if any). Since I don't own a PS2, I was fine with this.I didn't own a Blu-ray player but I do have a upconverting DVD-R player. When I heard of rumors that the Xbox-360 might come with a Blu-ray player, I waited to see what would happen. A few years ago I was going to get the Xbox360 since it had a HD-DVD player. I read a lot of forums and magazines to see that HD-DVD was weakening. I waited and waited until a month ago. I wanted to finally get a Blu-ray player.I bought this PS3 version. Although it doesn't have any memory slots, 80GB hard drive is plenty for me. I've spoken to several people including my brother and they are in love with the blu-ray player that is included on the PS3. I agree. The picture quality is amazing (Blue-ray movies). The dualshock 3 joystick is easy to use and the fact that it's wireless means that I don't have to stretch a wire trying to reach the couch to get comfortable. When it's plugged into the console via the USB cable, then watch out. Make sure you give enough notice or else! (Sorry dear!). The PS3 supports up to 4 controllers. This PS3 console is quiet as a mouse and runs cool. It does accululate a lot of dust so keep it in an area that doesn't get that dusty (if possible). Then again, I just wipe it with my LCD cloth. I have a 50' ethernet cable that I use to connect my Wii and the PS3 connects quickly to it (as long as you have it connected before you turn on, or else it takes slightly longer to recognize that you are connected). Finding updates is easy. The minor issue is when your games require an update. Sometimes, the PS3 will reset 5 times and act weird. It would reset, go to the game, and then reset. I took out the disc and turned off and on the console once; then it was fine. I'm not sure if this is the same for all the PS3 games, but the 3 games that I have are slow loaders. If your sweetheart's favorite program is on and you try to sneak one more game...trust me; don't do it. I created an account while on the internet which was easy. The internet was perfect; no stutters. Also when I was updating my games or getting updated rosters, no stuttering also. I played a few games online and everything was fine; no lockups, stuttering and/or lag.Finally, I am using a $1.50 6' HDMI plug and it works perfectly. I get a great picture and it's of amazing quality. I have my PS3 plugged into a Sharp Aquos 42\" LCD TV.Plus+You get the wireless Dualshock 3 controller that I see is retailed at $45-$54+A great Blu-ray player which retails from $179-$399+Play games online for free+80GB HDD+Games and movies look amazingMinus-Slow loading times-Updates can be annoying and cause some weirdness (but manageable)For a next-generation console with all of these goodies and a price of $399; this is a steal! If you are in the market for a Blu-Ray player and are a gamer, then get this. Great Value! Overall, I would give the PS3, 4.7 stars. Also, if you aren't a gamer, it's a great deal as well.

Paslay","summary":"Starting to reach its prime.","reviewText":"If you're reading this review, you've probably read plenty of others so I'll just cut to the chase. The major reason I waited so long to get the PS3, as opposed to getting the 360 and Wii shortly after their launch, was due to the lack of first party software support. Basically the PS3 was getting all the same games as the 360 but not nearly as many exclusive titles.Recently though there's been an increase in quality software. Check out Little Big Planet and Folklore to name a couple. Most of the Xbox exclusives are making there way to the PS3 as well. Not only that, but I too have been burned by the red ring. My faith in the reliability of the 360 has faltered. Finally, with the upcoming addition of Home and various firmware updates, the appeal of the social networking/online play of the PS3 has greatly increased to the point of being competitive with Live.The issue I have is Sony's \"Consumer Confusion\" strategy. There are 6 different consoles out there that all have varying capabilities and have only been available for certain amounts of time. Let's break them down:The original 80gig: 4 USB ports and software based PS2 emulation, No DualShock 3, WiFi. (No longer in production.)The MGS4 80gig edition: Comes with the original 80gig and MGS4 game. (No longer in production.)The MGS4 Limited Edition 40gig:4 USB ports, NO PS2 emulation, WiFi, No DualShock 3. (No longer in production.)The new 80gig: 2 USB ports, NO PS2 emulation, DualShock 3, WiFi (Currently in Production.)60gig console: 4 USB ports, PS2 hardware-based emulation, WiFi, No DualShock 3. (No longer in production.)20gig console: 4 USB ports, PS2 hardware-based emulation, No WiFi, No DualShock 3. (No longer in production.)40gig console: 4 USB ports, NO PS2 emulation, WiFi, No DualShock 3. (No longer in production.)160gig console: 2 USB ports, No PS2 emulation, WiFi, DualShock 3. (In Production.)So consumers have no idea what they're buying without doing a decent amount of research, especially if they're taking refurbished ones on Ebay into consideration. Furthermore, consumers have to make the decision to buy one now, or what to see what they'll release in 3 months. Make up your mind Sony.I ordered the new 80gig thinking it was the same 80gig as the MGS4 pack that was on the shelves only a few months ago. I figured they just weren't including the game anymore. To my surprise, it has 2 less USB ports than I thought and no PS2 compatibility. This is irritating because I have PS2 games that I enjoy playing from time to time, but my PS2 barely works anymore. (I was one of the unfortunate that bought one on launch day.) I really can't justify buying a new PS2. I can only hope that they release some software emulation in a future firmware update.All in all, it's a good system that's starting to get its act together. I would have given it five stars but the lack of backwards compatibility irks me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2008"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Zardshark","summary":"I love nintendo but the wii is just horrible","reviewText":"I have always been a big fan of nintendo and I have a NES and a GameCube but the Wii was just awful.  First, you have to use batteries for the controller.  The batteries need to constantly be replaced.  It also needs sensor bar to hook up and the wire is very fragile.  The systems tips over easily and is made out of cheap plastic.  The controller sucks so bad that the Super Nintendo had more buttons.  They say you can play GameCube games on the Wii but it doesn't come with a GameCube controller and it is not the same experience.  Most Wii games suck too, like Mario Party 8 was just a gimmick for the motion controls.  Also the motion controls don't work well and because they are wireless it takes forever to change the player numbers.  On the GameCube it was much easier.  Even the MarioKart on the Wii was crap compared to the GameCube version.  The Wii is just not fun, and once you find that you got the damn controller to work you'll see there aren't any good games.  Mario Galaxy was good, but it doesn't have camera controls like 64 and sunshine did because the Wii controller sucks so bad it doesn't even have enough controls to move the camera.  The Wii cost several hundred bucks but you'll end up spending several hundred more replacing batteries.  The charging stand doesn't help cause that's just more money and you can't play while charging.  Overall, the Wii is a piece of s*** and I highly recommend the classic systems like the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, or GameCube.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

When I first played COD5 (World at War) I was disappointed because I was expecting something even better or on par with COD4. The Treyarch approach to the franquise it's a little bit different than Infinity Wards' but one week later after my first play I gave the game another try and came to appreciate that actually both games are similar. This game uses the same COD4 engine and the scenarios are so beautiful that I could even leave the action of the game and take down the beach and just stare at the beautiful sights. The scenarios are so real you really feel you are there just like it happened with COD4. So, what I am trying to say is that you have to give this game another try and without expecting another COD4 you have to enjoy it as it is and just get the gist of the combat tactics. Once you get it you'll find that actually is quite similar than the COD4 gameplay. This is no COD4 but it is better than many others games available right now and I rather keep playing this one. I just wish all games were as COD4 and the whole COD franchise. Can you imagine a FPS based on RAMBO or PREDATOR movies using the same engine and team of COD?

Your tour of duty continues now.","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Great improvements nearly negated by big flaws.","reviewText":"I've always loved the Medal of Honor series, and Allied Assault is one of my favourite games of the past year.  Spearhead has made some good improvements on Allied Assault, but those improvements are offset by some highly substantial flaws.First of all, the price.  Whether three new missions and a handful of new weapons are worth the price is up to you.  I can say that it's amusing being able to commandeer a Nebelwerfer (the kind you only got to blow up in Allied Assault), and the new revolvers are fun to use, but only three new missions for a purchase price comparable to the original game?Secondly, the system mechanics.  Depending on what version of Allied Assault you have, the installation of Spearhead may cause all your old saved games to become unreadable.Finally, gameplay.  There are plusses and minuses.  The graphics took a big leap forward, but with that comes a price -- controls are harder because of all the eye candy.  When enemies get close, they often become flurries because of the graphical details.  A great improvement is the ability to use physical attacks (the &quot;pistol whip&quot;) with weapons other than pistols.  Finally, after three games, they give you this very simple, very useful option.  My biggest complaint is in some of the level designs.  Not only did Electronic Arts not learn from the negative feedback given to Allied Assault's &quot;sniper&quot; level (also known as the &quot;fighting 100 enemies you can't see&quot; level), but they make it even worse with two of the levels in this game.  If you fancy fighting enemies who hit you from all over but whom you can't even see, this is the game for you.  Not all levels are like that, but for me, it's a major slip-up in game testing that I have to actually fire blindly into the distance without being able to see my enemies.My biggest complaint is still the price.  Frankly, if I'd known there were so few new levels, I wouldn't have bought this game at all.  Perhaps the new multiplayer features make it worthwhile?  I don't play multiplayer so I don't know.  But the package is definitely overpriced.  Whereas expansion packs like those for The Sims (Livin' Large being especially impressive) and Armored Core make their original games twice as broad, Spearhead falls far below my expectations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2002"}

Equipped with a nano-technological supersuit, you have to use your abilities and your wits to move through hostile territory and uncover the reason behind the North Koreans' recent hostile movements. Your supersuit provides most of the game's gameplay. It can switch between Maximum Armor, Maximum Strength, Maximum Speed, and a Cloak mode. Every mode uses up recharging energy to do its job; Maximum Armor blocks damage until its energy runs out, Maximum Strength can punch down small houses and kill soldiers in a single hit, Maximum Speed lets you sprint at gazelle-like speed, and Cloak makes you invisible and lasts longer if you stay still.Of course, it's easy to assume that with all these abilities, you'd be an unstoppable death machine. In reality, you're more like a somewhat above-average regular person. The different abilities are more useful when used intelligently; Armor, for example, can only block four or five bullets, and speed only provides super-fast speed in bursts of a few seconds. Therefore, the game lies not in simply overpowering your enemies, but using your abilities well. However, the game still does a good job of making you feel powerful - there's nothing quite as neat as jumping over a wall, then killing the guard on the other side with a single punch. Creative use of your powersWhile the variety of guns isn't particularly great (the standard FPS assortment of assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, and so on), the real appeal of the guns lies in customization options. Each gun can take a variety of scopes, laser sights, silencers, and grenade launchers. The run-and-gun action in the game is reasonably fun, but as mentioned, it's better to play Smarter than Harder. The guns don't handle particularly well, and it's possible to hit an enemy 10 times in the chest without killing him, or hit him once in the head and have him die.The graphics in the game are its main attraction; the open maps consisting mostly of jungle environments look great and feel immersive, with near-realistic trees and grass. The huge maps and lush lighting effects complement the great feeling of the game. This is one of those games that people buy when they've just bought a top-of-the-line computer and want to show off what it can do. The sound design isn't that great, but it's serviceable.Overall, Crysis is a fun game, and if you've got a computer that can run it, then it's definitely worth picking up. The one major problem in gameplay is the twist near the end of the game. Not a simple storyline alteration, the twist results in a major change of gameplay. Overall, however, the game is fun and rewards creative thinking, a rarely-seen trait in most modern games.Rating: 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2009"}

Although the system has lasted about 6 years, the impact it has made with cartridge video games, will never be duplicated ever. When Mario Kart 64 came out in 1997, the field was just explosive unlike anything else. Then, nearly a year later, another mark in the racing form came about with Diddy Kong Racing. The game was just as surprising as the race that Mario Kart had left in the dust. Surprisingly, with Diddy Kong Racing, there was a little more at stake than meets the eye.With the release of Diddy Kong Racing, it took the racing game to another level. Unlike Mario Kart 64, there are three different kinds of vehicles to really choose from, instead of one: Kart-style, like Mario Kart 64, Airplane, and Hovercraft. It makes it a little different to rangle with, when in some courses you can race with only one of those vehicles, and on others, you can choose to race two or three vehicles. The game features the story of Diddy Kong and his friends trying to save Timber's Island from the clutches of Wizpig, a vile hog that holds control of the island. There are so many courses that are in the way that you must unlock in the story adventure mode. Still, there are also some other feels and challenges along the way, including unlocking challenges and two hidden charcters: Drumstick and T.T. and some very special codes that you can access in the tracks Mode.However, there are some flaws that Diddy Kong Racing has that were just surprising. First, there is a slower frame rate than Mario Kart 64, but the gameplay itself definitely makes up for that flaw. Another flaw is the control among some of the characters like Crunch The Alligator, and Banjo, the bear from the Nintendo 64 game, Banjo-Kazooie, is a little more difficult than evenly averaged in Mario Kart 64. The lighter charcters like Pipsy The Mouse and Tiptup The Turtle, provide a much better use for control in getting those challenges unlocked for a tasteful race with Wizpig in the final showdown.Although many people stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, there are some good agmes that still continue to push that pedal to the metal. Diddy Kong is one of them, if you really love the challenge. Considering that mostly all racing games are exactly the same as you could possible imagine, there are some games that still stand that gameplay.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

For that 15 bucks, I was not disappointed.  Arkham City brings all the fun things that made Arkham Asylum a fun game to play and made it better.  Better graphics, a great story, better music, better fighting, more things to do and use and a bigger area to search and explore.  And with the GOTY edition you get all the extra stuff as well including more things to do with Harley Quinn and Catwoman.  All that for 15 dollars is a steal.For those that haven't played the first Batman Arkham Asylum, it is not necessary to start there but I highly recommend not passing up the first before you go to the sequel as the first will wet your appetite for this one and you will be amazed at what they did for the follow up in Arkham City.  It is not often that you have a sequel that does so well at adding and bringing more that what the first game did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Void Zero","summary":"A FANTASTIC JOURNEY THROUGH SPIRA","reviewText":"Final Fantasy Ten is the greatest game for the Playstation 2.  The graphics are almost better than what most high-end personal computers can display, and the music is richly composed and is always geared to the different situations (battle music, tavern music, etc..).  The game's essence is similar to previous Final Fantasy titles, with turn-based combat and world exploration.  I will say that the voice acting is sometimes childish and over dramatic, but you can pass through the cut scenes by tapping the x button.  Essentially, the game is a full-blown RPG, which will probably bore and confuse those unfamiliar with the genre.  Final Fantasy one was first released for the 8-bit NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) in the late 1980's, and I became a fan instantly with the game when I purchased it.  FFX is not as short as some people would make you think.  To build up your characters you must fight literally thousands of battles, which means you must quit your job and your personal life if you wish to invest the proper time to fully appreciate this RPG.  If you like RPG's and science-fiction/ fantasy epics, you will be very happy with this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2002"}
{"product_name":"B003O6KWZK","description":"","reviewerName":"BooBoo","summary":"Good base gameplay, but shouldn't be retail.","reviewText":"Twisted Metal returns, and it's a solid shooting game in a wasteland of cover based, corridor shoot 'em ups, but it feels a bit... lacking.Originally this game was billed as a PSN title, a downloadable, but Sony wanted to press it into a full retail release and the content and production values are just not there, the game is robbery at a 60 dollar price point.Sony does not know how to leverege their own systems and open designs. Instead of making good downloadables, or F2P type titles, or mid-range discs, they keep slapping cheap extras on simple games and sending them out to die at a bloated price point. The servers are already dying off for good reason.The basic multiplayer is good, not great. Theres no actual characters anymore, just gangs, which sucks. The map design isnt as strong as it was for tightly designed maps (TM2) or good, open air environments (TM Black). Game modes are alright, they have the basics, and those work, but the maps and the new nuke mode arent particularly impressive.The campaign is a complete joke. Filled with terrible stages, very little content and it just isn't fun. The demo for the game showed the very peak of the experience for sure.Personally I think the brand still has (had, maybe) merit, and they could have rebooted it into something special or just made a fun retro romp on PSN. The method they took for designing this game was asinine however and probably finished it off for good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Mizov","summary":"Beautiful Remake but for Fans/Newbies Only","reviewText":"I bought the original Xbox in order to play Halo as I'd heard nothing but good things about it. I spent a decent amount of time in college screwing around in the split screen multiplayer, that's for sure.Let me just say that this is a completely faithful rendition. The gameplay is exactly the same, the checkpoints are exactly where they were, it's pretty neat. It's a little strange though to take a step back in terms of control. I had to retrain my brain to the older style of Halo gameplay. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it's just different.I'd say that Halo: Reach still looks a bit crisper and graphically entertaining, but, this gives Halo 3 and ODST a run for their money. It's also fun to switch the graphics between classic and redone with the push of a button. It's funny thinking back and saying \"oh man this looks so awesome!\" and then seeing how gorgeous things look time. Progress marches on I suppose.So is it worth it? Kinda.If you've never played Halo and want an introduction to the series it's perfect. If you're a huge Halo fan and want to experience the magic all over again, also perfect. If you kind of like Halo and want to check this out, maybe wait for a price reduction or rent it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Know What You're Getting","reviewText":"343 Industries has done an absolutely amazing job of redoing Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.  However, there's been some confusion about the purpose of the remake.  Because we're still talking about a ten-year-old code base being brought forward into new hardware, a new engine, and having a lot of new technology rolled in, the people involved in putting together this game could not make it all things to all people.  They had to pick and choose.So here then is what Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is:- A complete end-to-end remake of the Single Player campaign, with an added side-story and a few discoveries that lead to that- cooperative single-player Campaign play over XBox Live- A new set of multiplayer maps designed to give those more familiar with Halo: Reach a chance to play the original game through the newer Reach engine.  Not everybody has played the original Halo: Combat Evolved.  There are some people who still think the original Halo won't play on an XBox 360--it didn't at the 360's launch, but that issue has long been fixed and yes, it does run...this Anniversary edition is just a tremendous overhaul.- The addition of Trophies and Skulls for XBox Live achievements and added gameplay depth on multiplayerAnd here is what Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is NOT:- A perfect conversion of multiplayer over to XBox Live.  While there are a ton of customization options for your multiplayer fun, it's still all driven by the Halo: Reach engine and thus behaves like another flavor of Reach's multiplayer features.- The full feel of the original Halo: Combat Evolved multiplayer over LiveIf it were a full conversion, then 5 stars would easily be the best rating.  As it is, this game is 5 stars of fun and almost 5 for the features it *does* carry over.  When I installed the game, I got a code to download 1.2GB of multiplayer maps *in addition to* the few that came with the game.  I also got some tinier perks, like downloading male or female Master Chief suits for my XBox Live Avatar.Here on CE: Anniversary, multiplayer is Reach-driven, and so that means jet packs, power shields, etc.--just with the addition of CE's remastered maps plus a few newer maps.  You DO NOT have to own Halo: Reach to play the multiplayer in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.None of the goodies really compare though to the original intent that shines through in this game:  a complete, end-to-end remake of the Single Player Campaign.The bad news is, in order to help you understand what you get, I have to give you a few spoilers.The good news is, I'll keep them to a minimum, and only talk about the opening level, in which you have to escape the Pillar of Autumn.I've recently replayed Halo for the PC, overriding the game's settings to crank it as far as today's gaming PC hardware can go.  It's awesome to play, but it can still only get so good.  When you see how stiffly people move and how simple their textures are, you're reminded that gaming has come a long way in the past decade.  Popping in the Combat Evolved Aniversary was exactly what I'd wished my PC could do (and boy do I wish they'd make this for the PC!).- Everybody has entirely new \"everything\":  newer face models, more polygons, and they all move a lot more naturally because they've got more 'bones'.  When the sirens go off in the original Halo, you see stiff-legged jogging.  In CE Anniversary, ONI's bridge crew lean forward, bend their knees, and break into a real run.- Levels don't just have a lot more color:  the 'set' has been completely re-dressed.  The same objects have more color, walls and bulkheads have more definition and lighting, and the overall lighting is not only more natural, it shows how much shadow had to be crammed into the indoor sets in the original game to keep things running smoothly.  The shadows are lifted and there is a lot more to see now.- The Environment has been given an overhaul:  when explosions rock the Pillar of Autumn, your camera gets jostled and you feel like the Master Chief shifted his feet to steady himself.  Bodies lying on the deck will go flying if a grenade goes off.  Your enemies will get knocked over or tumble forwards just like in the original game, but now their arms are pinwheeling and their limbs are flailing.  Explosions knock objects around, and just like Halo 3 and Reach, you can get splash damage a bit easier because the physics is real.- Visual Effects get an upgrade:  flames look much better, Covenant grenades give off blue flashes, and volumetric lighting effects like explosions, fog, and neon glows look more realistic to the eyes.- There's a broader sound palette.  Best example:  the smaller race of Covenant (Grunts) wear breathers that feed them the gas of their home planet's atmosphere.  If I'm sneaking around, I can actually hear their respirators purring their air supply to them.So then there are the story extras.  I'll give you just one example here--the moment you finish talking to Keyes and he hands you your first weapon, there's a console right next to you that says, 'Press 'X' to activate terminal'...and when you do, you get to see that the Halo is communicating with your ship.  It's a very interesting embedded cinematic that adds depth to the story and helps explain the whole idea that humans are the chosen descendents of the Forerunner race.  The ring's keeper (Guilty Spark) discovers you and your cyborg armor and uses that knowledge to decide that humanity is ready to be allowed aboard and discover the technology of the Forerunners.  It's an interesting aside, and right in those two minutes is a nice level of extra detail to the story.My only real quibble with the new look is that Captain Keyes is very different looking.  He appears younger to me, and his face is more like that of an aging combat soldier than it is a space-naval officer.  I believe they did this to bring him inline with the Halo novels, though:  Keyes is supposed to be relatively young for a ship's captain.Despite the fact that newer code is running, the enemy aren't capable of some of the things you see in the other Halo installments.  For example, even though the Elites (taller Covenant) can still leap very high in the air, I haven't seen Covenant climb over anything to get at me, or leap onto or off of a platform--they still seem to be stuck to ramps and a bit limited in their movement.  Since Halo 1 did not contain the big gorilla-like Brutes, you won't find anybody picking up huge objects and throwing them at you.  You also won't have the larger set pieces get scattered everywhere like they do in Halo 3 and beyond.  Still, there are times the enemy makes up for their movement limitations by being much more clever:  I've been flanked a bit more in CE: Anniversary, and if they see me, enemies are also quicker to pick up on me trying to come around behind them.If you're a fan of the original Halo: Combat Evolved single player campaign, you will very much enjoy this remake.  It is money well spent.  If you are a fan of the multiplayer element to the original Halo: Combat Evolved, this is not the same animal, but if you can forgive the differences, you will still be rewarded with some new maps, your favorite maps in the Reach engine, and a slew of customization options that should offer you hours of gameplay.  If you're new to the Halo series and would like to see what the original story was about, you won't find a Lucas-style rewrite of key story elements:  you'll instead find an original story, with some added detail.  Multiplayer is not a perfect XBox Live matchup system and it's not a detailed recreation of the original, but I believe that, given what they had to work with, 343 Industries has done a great job here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

Stoffer","summary":"Viking: Great graphics and good gameplay, but nothing else to offer","reviewText":"MY PERSONAL OPINION: Despite outstanding graphics, decent gameplay, and easy achievements, this game falls very short as far as story, variety, customization, and originality.PROS:-Graphics are truthfully on the level of Assassin's Creed. Need I say more?-Gameplay was one of the better features, but it was still a pretty simple and dumbed down hack n slash game. True you can dismember enemies, but that offers little more than graphic pleasure. It would have been much more entertaining if maybe you could disarm enemies or even cut an arm off and have them keep fighting. I thought the bosses were pretty easy as well; all you have to do really is dodge and wait for a certain button to pop up and press it.In truth, all you have to do to defeat the majority of enemies is mash one or two buttons again and again till they go down. Also, whenever your attacks land you gain energy for your charge attacks, which reminded me of the musou attacks from Dynasty Warriors.-Looting is fine but nothing out of the ordinary. All you have to do is run over items that your enemies drop, like health potions, to obtain the. Except for chests, then you have to either hold or tap a button.CONS:- The story is about a resurrected Viking who goes on a campaign to seek vengeance and reclaim his homeland from an evil Greek Goddess. Sound a little like God of War? Also, the main character doesn't say one word and so you get no character development. There are also no plot twists, notable supporting characters, factions. Nada.-One of the things that I was super disappointed with is that you can never upgrade nor change your weapons. Your three main weapons are your sword, axe, and throwing axes. Also, there is no armor or repairing in the game.-The only thing you can really do with the money you earn is buy health items or new combos (which don't really change the game all that much).-You can't customize your character at all. No clothes, haircuts, or tattoos - nothing.-You're always on foot. It would have been nice if you could have had the option to buy a horse or have been able to ride your dragons so you don't have to walk everywhere all the time.-The missions themselves are very repetitive and lack variety. You rescue other Vikings, kill some traitor, or kill a group of enemies to clear a location.-The enemies themselves aren't anything special either, there are about eight different types of enemies and each class of unit all look exactly the same as the next. The enemies you typically encounter don't have much to distinguish themselves as far as difficulty other than the fact that they have a shield or you have to hit them more times before they finally go down.-What most critics are saying that is so great about this game is the huge battles. In reality, there are only 3 or 4 of them and if you try to fight the whole army you'll die over and over again. The point is to take out the groups of sorcerers to stop the spawning of new troops. So, it's really a trick to make you think it's going to be awesome when really it's like Dynasty Warriors in the sense that all you have is take out the leaders and you win automatically.Specifically, all you have to do is rush towards and kill the sorcerers manually or use your tokens to get your dragon to kill them for you. You get these tokens for doing things like killing all the archers or killing a giant.Also, the objectives for these big battles never change; the only thing that separates each battle from the next is the scenario and landscape.LAST NOTE: Viking is worth the cheap price it is now on Amazon of less than ten dollars, but it became a real bore, almost a chore, to finish after few hours of playing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}
