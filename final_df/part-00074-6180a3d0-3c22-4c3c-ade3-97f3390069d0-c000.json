{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

The game ambiance is beautiful.  The combination of CGI environment with the music and sounds are amazing.  Basically, you are a boy warrior trying to help a little girl princess escape the grasps of her evil queen mother who wants to use her (the princess) to prolong her (the queen) life.  While trying to escape the castle you are confronted with lots of puzzles while various evil shadow creatures attempt to pull the princess back to the queen.  ICO is definitely one of those sleeper hits.  But the only thing lamer than raving fanboys pointlessly sticking up for their favorite console are online price jackers.  This game is one of those games where one day someone said \"I love this game, I'm going to put it on eBay and further bastardize the term \"rare\" by putting that in the description to try and sell this game at a hugely inflated price.\"  And you know what...it worked.  Even though this game is far from being in short supply on the used games sales list, or rare, people are still willing to pay around [...] for it simply because the online retail sector says it should be so.  The game is awesome and very challenging, but seriously, stop paying these people these ridiculous prices for these types of games.  If people stop buying the games at these prices then eventually the prices will drop to a fair, used price.  The game is not rare, so do not believe it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

Maybe it's that I got too frustrated at too many puzzles.  Maybe it seemed slower without as much fighting.  But for whatever reason, I didn't like this LEGO game as much as some of the others.  I've played a little bit of quite a few of the LEGO games including Batman, Star Wars, and Pirates, but Indy just didn't seem as fun.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game.  And especially when you compare the price to many of the other 360 games out there, it's not a bad deal.  It's definitely a game you can let your kids play.  It's a game that you can pick up and master the controls in about 2 minutes.  It has all the elements of an Indy movie: fighting with enemies, whips, secret doors, even a love interest in the woman.  Especially if you've played other LEGO games, you'll likely enjoy this one too.This is obviously a must for true fans of the Indy movies, and I wouldn't say this game is bad or not worth your money, I just found some of the other LEGO games more fun than this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8J8","reviewerName":"Poshu Oshu","summary":"2 steps forward, 1 large step back","reviewText":"my opinion is definitly a little slanted because I LOVED the first army of two. and i overall really enjoyed this one. it's alot of fun and the shooter mechanics and general third person interface work really well. they're not spectacular but they are functional, not flashy but good. however in making the sequal here it seems a little design by comitee comenced and the things that made me love the first AOT were determined to be the reason for the mediocre reaction to it. apparently in the era of gears of war and halo AOT of all things was deemed \"too meathead\" in it's humor and the characters were blasted as over macho idiots. i loved the humor and the characters. so the humor was toned down, Rios and salem are alot more subdued now and they really don't seem to enjoy their work like in the first one. seems to me if your gonna be a mercenary you might as well like doing it. and because it is the flavor of the month they added morality choices, i'm guessing to give depth to rios and salem. the moral choices are kind of interesting and give you some options as what jobs you want to accept but the choices tend to be rather crap.The \"new\" humor i have to admit is not a step forward, the game is still funny but one stage is set in a zoo where all the animals have been murdered. it's suposed to set the tone and make you dislike the leader of the 40th day initiative as a maniac. but to me it's just morbid and the morality choice of killing a tiger to get the gun from his pen is really not cool. you can just buy the gun anyway so its not like you have to kill the tiger ever for completion purposes but honestly it's just kinda unnesisary.for a co-op game the co-op has been toned down alot. i liked that AOT was all about two people, lots of step jumps and back to back moments and situations where you HAD to rely on your partner. in this game they took out the co-op snipe feature, not a big deal when playing with two people but it's just symptomatic of the design changes. there are two back-to-back moments in the whole game, and while one is totally awsome the other is just basic. i wasn't the biggest fan of the back-to-back mode in AOT but mostly because you had no control over it. if they made it so you could back-to-back under the right circumstances anytime. it'd be a great feature. also there are like 5 step jumps in the game and only 1 of them enables you to kill enemies while being held aloft to make it easier when you advance. the most glaring omission in the sequel is the really awsome rescue mechanics. in AOT you had to rescue injured npcs from time to time by slinging them over your shoulder and having your partner gun down enemies clearing a path for you since you could only use a pistol like this. it got annoying at times but that was the idea. and it was far and away better than any other escort mechanics i'd ever seen in a game. instead we have the equivalant of \"puzzles\" in the form of civilian rescues where you have to reach a highly ranked enemy and take him hostage to disarm the other soldiers. i do like this new feature it's pretty cool but with the ecception of one or two they're pretty straightforward.now for the goodRios's new voice actor is pretty bad ass, gives a real body to how he sounds, since he's a big guy it's a good thing. salems new voice actor is a pretty good guy, but not one i woulda chose for salem. the interactions between the two affects the dialoge and if you really piss each other off they more or less decide to go their seperate ways after they escape china. the supporting characters are good in this one, this game coulda used alot more alice murray in it but she is in it enough to make me happy. the new supporting characters are pretty good too, the crazy russian while not nearly as much fun as clyde is a nice addition to the cast list.the weapon customisation is alot better in this one. once you buy a gun you get all the peices of it to use on any other gun that is similar enough to use it. i have the clip from an ak-47 jammed into an m4 with the barrel from another gun on the end of that. the customisable guns really affect the gameplay. in AOT my friend and i were so agressive the agro meter teetered back and forth and neither of us benefitted from it. in this game by putting silencers and the proper paint jobs on my guns, i build almost no agro and my friend goes in guns blazing with shotguns and hand cannons and i get to pick off guys left and right with my scoped assault rifle or even just run around busting heads with melee attacks. and the melee attacks are just wonderful, with or without the bayonette attachments you really put people in a hurt lockeroverall the game has been improved, but i miss the old salem charm and while i enjoyed the story overall, it's the kind of story you'd find in a spin off. the first game was all about completeing paid jobs but since you worked at a company you had no choice over the jobs but you went around the world doing some great stuff. now you have your own company, you get to choose the jobs, you can go anywhere. so they chose to lock the second game with a short job and a long trek home. i really want them to do a true mercenaryish game where you get to choose from a long list of jobs and complete them in whatever order you decide or even in a preset order but have them be actual mercenary work. this is a story of two mercenary bad asses caught in a bad situation not two mercenaries doing their jobs. which is fine, but like i said, would make a nice sidestory.i can't recomend or not recomend this game because it's got a very specific audience and i just happen to be a part of it. so the best advice i can give you is to rent it and try it for yourself, it's not as bad as people say it is but it's not as good as i say it is either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The game Shinobi fans have waited years for","reviewText":"Anyone old enough to have owned a Genesis will remember the all time classic 2-D side scroller Revenge of Shinobi (no, I don't mean the one on the Game Boy Advance either), a game that offered loads of fun with it's simple gameplay mechanics and ultra hard difficulty.  Sega and developer Overworks have finally brought us the first true 3-D game to feature Shinobi, and man is it great.  You get to go through a great looking post-apocalyptic Tokyo taking on enemy ninjas, dogs, and supernatural foes.  At your disposal are the good 'ol shurikens and your sword, while you also have new abilities like scaling walls and casting a ghostly image behind you that confuses enemies and takes you in long distances in a short amount of time.  The graphics are jaw dropping and the voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in a game, while the controls are dead on although they will take some getting used to.  However, Shinobi is not without it's flaws; the game is super difficult and gamers looking for an easy walkthrough will not get it here.  Not to mention that no matter when you die, you'll re-spawn back in the beginning of the level, which can get very frustrating.  The camera angle can be grating as well when there is a lot of on screen action, but besides all that, Shinobi is a real winner.  All in all, fans of the old Shinobi games of years ago or those looking for some very challenging gameplay should definitely pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"A Japanese RPG for the American gamer","reviewText":"Lost Odyssey is not what you'd call a traditional xbox 360 game, which is good, because those who have been waiting for a real turn based RPG finally have a game. It is very close in relation to the Final Fantasy series. This is because the creator is from Square Enix. There are a few differences which sets it apart from those games both good and bad. Much like the FF franchise, it has a very deep story, involves lots of magic and of course the use of swords. Everything you'd expect from a traditional turn based RPG is in this game. The story follows a man named Kaim Argonar who is immortal, invincible and has lived for over a 1000 years.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a rather lengthy review, so if you just want the short review of the game skip to the part that says recap.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics 8/10The beginning sequence of the game is a very long full motion video of a large scale battle and at the end of it Kaim enters a turn based battle against some 30-40 Khent soldiers. It appears as if you never left the video. The graphics from the video (which are brilliant) are just barely better than the battle and in-game graphics. The people especially have incredible detail. The facial features of the main characters are rather amazing. Unlike games from even a few years ago, you can clearly tell the difference in age by the faces. The shapes of the faces and bodies are so human. The graphic designer did a remarkable job at producing roundness. When they speak or laugh their gestures are evident through facial features as well as their body language. It appears as if there were actually muscles programmed into the faces to give realism. Hair is also split up into multiple groups and moves at the character moves.The backgrounds are very vivid and detailed as well. Reflections and shadows are amazing. The water will give reflections that are incredibly lifelike. Weapons look brilliant. It isn't all good however. Because of the graphic level of the main characters many of the other people in the game don't look as good in comparison. Also, props (I call them) carts, barrels, etc. look more like the first generation of games for the system. So it is really a mixed bag on the graphics, but the things of interest are very well done. Other than that it looks really good compared to an average Xbox 360 game.Characters 9/10The character development in Lost Odyssey is second to none. And the characters each have their own specific mannerisms and way of talking. They also have their own unique personalities. With such depth in the characters, another dimension is added to the game which you will never get from anything but a quality role playing game. And other than Kaim, unlike many other JRPGs the developers did a good job at making the people not appear to be inherently Japanese. I have no problem with Japanese people, but adverse people make the game considerably more interesting. What really sets Lost Odyssey apart from other games I've played is the ability to relate the characters to the player and make a real connection.Story 10/10I haven't played a game that had such an enveloping story such as this since Final Fantasy VII. It is the very crux of Lost Odyssey and its greatest achievement. I will try to outline the story without giving too much away. As the immortal Kaim Argonar you are an immortal being who has lived for at least 1000 years. Essentially Kaim is a career mercenary for a country called Uhra. His superior-Gongora very quickly is established as the antagonist who is also immortal. There are also two other countries specifically involved in relations with Uhra and the politics really play in. As you advance you meet new characters as well as three other immortals.What really sets the game apart from any other Japanese-type RPG is the dreams. Kaim had a spell placed on him that destroyed his memory of the past thousand years and throughout the course of the game he will notice things that sparks the memory back. These are short stories in written text on the screen. They are really very well done albeit somewhat depressing. Each one has to do with Kaim's endless journey and the finite lives of the people he met along the way. I really can't find any faults in the story. It has the makings of a brilliant novel, but you get to play through it.Battle System 7/10As you'd expect with a JRPG there is a turn-based battle system. It is rather simple. You can attack, use items, magic, skills or defend. One really nice feature is the ability to change equipment in battle. So if you are facing an enemy which has contrary elemental strengths or weaknesses, you can adjust on the fly. Another kind of more complex aspect is the ratings of the characters from A-H, A being the best. On the loading screens you get to see a glimpse of the characters ratings such as attack speed, magic casting, attack, HP, so forth. Kaim's HP is rated an A, while his magic casting time is F. Therefore a person with a high attack speed will not be able to cast magic as fast and vice versa. In fact some spells can take 2 or 3 turns to cast if it is a very advanced spell.In Lost Odyssey you have this thing called a GC which is a rating of your defenses on the front line based on their HP. This determines your overall defense from attacks and also how much more defense the back row will receive. When this goes down your back row (normally magic casters) will be more susceptible to magical and especially physical attacks. The same goes for the enemy. The only way to get your GC meter back up once it has been taken down is with a skill called wall or variations of it.The other new battle feature is the ring system. You are able to equip rings which have special skills such as an elemental attack attached to your regular attack, or a poison ring, rings that work well against aerial enemies. There are literally dozens of kinds for each type of enemy. Then with a ring equipped you hold the trigger and time it to create a better effect. The better timing you have, the stronger the attack. My problem with the battle system is that many times while fighting enemies and particularly bosses it seems that the game just gives the enemies the upper hand. I'll be attacked by an enemy at the end of one turn and then he'll get the first hit the next turn as well. So it is like he has 1.5 turns instead of just one. Therefore it is somewhat inconsistent.Magic and Skill System 8/10The magic in Lost Odyssey is mostly unoriginal. Aside from the name changes, it has all the facets of a traditional RPG. You have your elemental magic including three levels, effect magic (poison, sleep, paralyze etc), shielding magic and curing magic. Only the effect magic is somewhat new at least for me. There are all the regular ones like poison, sleep and paralyze, but there is also freeze, virus, formation lock and a few more. The rest is pretty much inconsequential. I wasn't particularly impressed with the magic. The worst part is a lot of the magic is found like an item instead of learned. I think a little more creativeness should have been used here. However, the immortals can learn any skill or magic that a mortal character already has, making the game much more interesting.I was however impressed with the skill system more than the magic. There are some very interesting skills once you get later into the game. A few worth mentioning: combo, taunt-brings attacks to that person, persistence-keeps character alive even with no HP left. Immortals can learn very valuable skills like anti-paralysis, anti-poison and anti-seal. Also along with that you can get slot seeds for all immortals which allow you to raise the number of skills you can use at any one time. This keeps the game interesting.Equipment 6/10In the game there are three types of equipment: weapons, rings and accessories. Much of the equipment changing occurs for the people who actually attack on a regular basis, so there is no point to changing the weapons of the magic casters. Because of this, buying weapons really gets monotonous. Buy two identical swords for Seth and Kaim. Repeat.Music / Voice Acting 9/10I really enjoyed the music in Lost Odyssey. It is beautiful and perfectly fit the feel of the game. Most of it has an otherworldly feel. While some of it is just creepy sounding. The general theme is kind of solemn and at times depressing. However, there is a lot of death in the game.Voice acting was superb. Ming especially brought the character of the queen of Numara to life. She has a very formal British accent. Kaim's voice was a perfect choice for him, very masculine, and despite him being rather quiet it fit the character. Some of the best voice acting I've heard. A negative to the voice acting is some of the conversations didn't make sense. Jansen in particular was guilty of this. There were a lot of assumptions that the gamer was supposed to figure out on their own.Gameplay 4/10Gameplay I feel is very limited. It really pains me to say it because almost everything else about the game is top notch. You have battles and you have walking around looking for stuff. There aren't any side-games. There are a few secrets for getting special weapons, but nothing really that great. There are no super bosses to look for to test your skill. Basically the gameplay is a washed out version of Final Fantasy in my opinion. And most likely a version marketed for the more FPS-minded gamers who purchased the Xbox 360. It is a simpler game.By far the greatest downfall of the game is what seems like an endless line of cut scenes. This is where the game really loses a lot of its initial luster. For the first few hours of the game I thought that the FMVs (full motion videos) were just because it was the beginning of the game. Unfortunately I was completely wrong. In fact, the videos remain consistently dense all through the game. I'd say it averages out to about a movie every 15-20 minutes. In fact in the third disc I watched a movie for what had to be near an hour. Don't get me wrong. The videos are brilliantly done and the voice acting is spot on, but you just get the feeling that they ran out of unique playable content. If the game is 40 hours long, then at least 15 hours is cut scenes. Because of this, like the Playstation  games of old there are four DVD discs. This is kind of nostalgic and kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Oblivion fit on one disc and easily housed over 100 hours of content.Now back to the point. My qualms with the endless cut scenes and FMVs would be squelched much more easily if it weren't for the terrible setup for the world map and the level cap. There is no way to get anywhere you haven't been before without following the linear setup the developers created. You soon learn that that ship you were given can't traverse the hyper currents in the ocean and therefore you are railroaded to the next part of the game. I was incredibly disappointed by this.So, because you can't explore the other areas and can only go backwards you cannot level up in the traditional sense. In other words you can't go and \"grind\" to make the characters as strong at you want. If you decide to go backwards and try to level up it won't work either. The level cap is set for certain areas of the game. What I mean is that say you go into a cave for example and you are level 30 to begin with. That area has a maximum level you can attain no matter what. Let's say it is 35. Once you have reached that level you will not gain any more experience points for the characters who have reached that predetermined level. The real reason I rated the gameplay so low was because that excitement you get with leveling up just isn't there. Building up your character is the backbone behind any good RPG. When you don't get to change armor and you can't get out of the storyline's areas it really puts a hamper on the exploration.I really can't find anything new or good about the gameplay. Were it not for the other parts of the game, this would be average at best.Largest negativesLoading times for the battles in particular are very long. Most of the battles will takes anywhere between 15-30 seconds before you get to choose your first action. Along with that, the save points are few and far between in the most literal sense of that expression. In an area that would take probably 3-4 hours to get to the boss, you'll have two save points, sometimes less.Because of the difference in speed of attacks and casting between the characters, one person's spell or attack could take as many as three sequences of turns before it commences. A normal set of turns will take about a minute between the two parties and that doesn't include the time it took to pick out the attack, spell or skill you wanted to use. In general, most battles will run about 5 minutes from beginning to end, which may not seem long. However when you're just trying to get to a save point, it will really add loads of time and frustration. In fact, I've had battles that have lasted for near a half an hour. They weren't boss battles. Because of this I really got burnt out on leveling up and learning new skills.The story is incredibly linear. A story that is 90% linear in this day and age is not something you want to see in an RPG. There is no place to just walk around the map and look for random battle; you ALWAYS have to choose a place on the map once you leave the previous one. It makes the gamer feel closed in and prevents a whole lot of sidequests or secrets.RecapGraphics - 8/10, amazing level of detail in the faces, seamless transition between full motion and regular gameplay, very smooth animation for the most partCharacters - 9/10, extremely diverse characters and great character development as good as a novel, easy to see the three dimensionality of each personStory -10/10, absolutely brilliant story with many different intertwining plotlines and such depth that I've never seen in a game, especially the \"dreams\" of KaimVoice Acting - 9/10, excellent, the game is really brought to life with the inflections and intonations of the voice actorsBattle System - 7/10, very good battle system, nothing really new unfortunately, but fairly simple, short learning curveMagic / Skills - 8/10, magic is pretty standard, with a few new effects but same elements as any RPG, skills are amazingly diverse and allow for the immortals to learn any skill a mortal person knowsGameplay - 4/10, gameplay is completely uninspiring, too many cut scenes, storyline is overly linear, no free-roam, lengthy battles, there is very little good about the gameplay.The game is actually a decent game overall, so I'll let you make your own decision on the final rating. Being it is the only recent turn based RPG for the Xbox 360 it is better than any other one previously made by a long shot. However if there are future games I just hope that there are more resources for the developers, because it is clear they don't have the same ability as Square Enix. However, the story will strike a chord with anyone who has an ounce of humanity and was brilliantly executed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2008"}

I won't spoil it for you, one of the boss fight (hint: flying, sands) is the best I have encountered in my whole gaming career (yeah let's call it a career).A lot of games in the new gen have been inspired by these two master creation. GoW, UC series, even games like LBP2 have their own reflection of the two games. ICO has brought the brilliant mode of AI computer co-op and deep relation between the player and an AI character.

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"Good game with a lot more cinematic flair and a fun combat system","reviewText":"Well I just got done with the game (ah the joys of the long 4th of July weekend). I am someone who loved DA:O and wrote a glowing review on it. Frankly I liked DA2 more and find it hard now to go back to DA:O anymore. I just don't really understand the hate for this game but than everyone is entitled to their views. When I play games I am looking for some good, fun times and really not any kind of serious challenges or overly complex tactical scenarios maybe because my real life already has all that and games to me are mechanism of fun escapism and DA2 fits the bill here perfectly. I am currently on my second play through as a mage and it's again fun so far playing a different class and I am not bored or anything.I think Bioware kind of fumbled really bad on the marketing of this game. This is not a true sequel but rather a stand alone rpg set in the world of DA:O. They are references to the events of DA:O but the whole plot of the game is independent; kind of like a spin-off tv or movie series. I guess if they would have positioned the game correctly it may not have suffered the kind of wrath it did. Now that being said the game in my view has been trashed sometimes unfairly bordering on hate for the sake of hate just because it's not a clone of DA:O.A lot has been said on this game so I am going to keep my review concise and highlight what I liked and disliked about the game. The game does have some Cons but the Pros far exceed them.PRO's:1) The graphic engine (with the high texture patch) is leagues ahead of the original. The buildings, interiors, exteriors, dungeons, armor, cut-scenes etc. look beautifully rendered and highly detailed in my view.2) The voiced protagonist lends a more cinematic and personal feel to the game. One of my complaints with the original game was the disconnect I felt with my silent Grey Warden and DA:O to me felt backwards coming to play it after ME2. The conversation wheel in my view makes it more stream-lined to follow the story of the quest and it is much more intriguing to see what Hawke will actually say which lends to a more cinematic feel.3) The story line of the game feels more personal as it is the story of Hawke rising to fame & glory from rags. It doesn't have the epic feel of clear-cut good vs evil fight of the original but it does appeal to me more in the form of my (Hawke) story line amidst all the political and other schemes going on.4) The combat system is indeed a real improvement over DA:O. I many times thought of giving up on DA:O just because the combat was slow, sluggish and boring. DA2 combat is lot more fun, faster plus the animations are real good, and funny sometimes (I can never have enough of those exploding enemies hehe). Playing a warrior in DA2 was lot more fun than it was in the original.5) The banter between the companions is back and is better than ever. Try to put Isabella with other ladies and hear the amusing fireworks. Sometimes it's quite fun to be had. :)CONS:1) Repeated use of the same maps. Initially it doesn't matter much but as you are in Act 2 and up you do begin to notice this. Frankly DA:O used the same recycled maps in most interior dungeons but the game did had us travel to different locations which eased the fact that interior dungeons were recycled. I think in DA2 having the player just stay in and near Kirkwall exacerbated this feeling greatly. I hope in DA3 Bioware really pays attention to this fact.2) Limited ability to equip the party members. I am 50/50 on it. In DA:O though initially i liked dressing up my party members but later it just became a irritating hassle. I am somewhat glad they toned it down in DA2 but i think they toned it down too much. I think I should be allowed to equip my party members with basic armor and weapons of all kind without any restrictions. Bioware should address this too in DA3.3) A bit too overt gay angles in the game. I mean it looks like almost all male characters wants to start a romance while it takes quite a effort to work on the females party members (except Isabella ofcourse). Very soon whether it was the optimal configuration or not my team members were all females hehe.In all I ended my journey of DA2 on a happier note, felt my money spent was worth it and looking forward to DLC's and DA3. Now if Bioware can combine what made DA2 great like the voiced protagonist, the new combat system with DA:O epic story line and customization options they might make amends to the offended fan base and have a hit rpg once again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"Where is the series element?","reviewText":"Chrono Cross WOULD have been a great game, it had a unique system, it was hard, it had a good plot, it had many side quests.  For any one who played Chrono Trigger however, this game does the idea of a sequal little justice.Chrono Cross picks up 10 years after Chrono Trigger ends, at a series of islands too small to use in Chrono Trigger (but I have heard they are there).  It has innumerable playable characters, which makes the game interesting, but has many issues which Squaresoft should have seen.First of all, with the multitude of playable characters, you lose plot.  Some of the characters of the story fit into it in many ways, these are the main characters such as Serge and Kid.  However there are many characters who just appear.  Starky, Van, and others have no point in the story, only a side quest which sticks to the story like an old, wet bandage.Also, with that many characters, they couldn't give them many techs, so therefore another of Squaresoft's great innovations from Chrono Trigger was lost.  Some history: in Chrono Trigger you have abilities called techs.  You learn these as you gain AP (gained like EXP, only slower).  Monsters, who moved about on the screen, would be targeted by techs in different ways.  Some techs would only hit one monster, some would hit monsters in a certain radius from the character, or from the target monster, and some would hit all monsters.  Since the monsters were constantly moving, this made placement of the characters and monsters essential to how techs were cast.  Also each character had three double techs with each other character, and each combination of characters which included the main character had a triple tech.  Not so in Chrono Cross.  I believe there were about 12 to 20 double and triple techs, and three techs per character (there were about 10 or more in Chrono Trigger).  This meant that you would have to go through the game more than once possibly to discover who had them.  Sometimes these characters couldn't even be gotten together in one game, so you may have to go through three times to find a certain move.  Also with all the side quests to get many of the items, I recomend the strategy guide for this game also.The game's plot also had some gaps.  There are certain places where you are expected to do something, but either don't know which world to do it in, or can't find where to do it.  Sometimes you will have a suggested opportunity to get new characters which you won't know about because it never suggests exploring certain places.  There is one point where it is essential to find characters, but it doesn't tell you they are available.  Another annoying plot point is that any character will suddenly join the party with the knowledge of every event that has occured in the story, there is no explaination scene, a fact which annoys me when a new character in the group starts talking in detail about an event which happened before they joined the group.The game is fun, and the new game +, one of the few elements which was kept over from Chrono Trigger, allows for great replayability.  All in all though, I was dissapointed.  I expected a sequal true to the original's good points, something not delivered upon to my dismay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2003"}

Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"RPG or adventure platformer?","reviewText":"I just started playing this game, so I can't write a great review on it.  What I can tell you is that there is a good reason why just starting might end up being the only thing I do in this game.First off the game has some faults to begin with, the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me.  The characters are kind of on the blockish side, they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds.  This might pass on the PSX but it's not acceptable on a console like the PS2.  The characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of Final Fantasy X, but of course what doesn't.  That's why Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Xenosaga is... well Xenosaga.The Xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far, but again this is an RPG and interesting might not be enough.  When I first started Final Fantasy X, I will admit I wasn't too trilled but then something happened.  I can't pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go. Can't say the same for FFX-2 however.  Moving on, I have a feeling Xenosaga has a super great plot, but unfortunately I may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that I don't think I can handle.I was interested in Xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic RPG.  I play RPG's for the involvement in an epic storyline, I don't play RPG's for gameplay.  I feel sorry for anyone who plays RPG's for the menu selections, if you want gameplay there are better genres out there.  I always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an RPG or that the game doesn't have enough exploration.  If you want gameplay and exploration go play something else.  That's the problem with Xenosaga, it's not just an RPG it's also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that.  The platformer part of Xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that, but there seems to be too much of it.  There are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller.  There are too many keys to find, too many doors to unlock, and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost.  It's not like it's there just incase you want to look around.  Nope, you find out you need to go somewhere but the map doesn't show you where, you have to search for it yourself.  This is just not what I look for in an RPG.  If this doesn't change in Xenosaga soon, I'm afraid I'll have to can it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2003"}

In A lot of games the weapons are either overpowered or underpowered, in this game however, they feel right and deliever the right amount of \"pop\". The game runs around 6-9 hours, which is medium legnth for this genre. It has you playing as several different factions throughout the game. You will enjoy the missions as the Americans the most, the others are very old and and useless feeling.Another strong thing I will say about this game, is that at it's current price it's a steal. I payed 25 and I wasn't disappointed. Your getting it for half of that! I would recommend purchasing this game.Graphics 7.5Sound  7.0Framerate 8.0 ( glitches rarely )Story 6.0Achievements 7.5 ( good blend )Overall 7.5-8.0","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2008"}

The grim Necromancers worship in the wastelands of Heresh...and the ravenous demons are immured in Sheogh, their prison world.    During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding.    Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded...     Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units.

I really dig the retro games being published on the DS.  That being said:This is not your traditional RPG.  This is a strategy RPG, puzzle game combined.  But it is amazingly fun!Graphics are good, but I play on the DSI XL, I can't imaging trying to differentiate the colors of some of the units on the smaller screen (the bears and Unicorns in particular).  The characters don't actually 'move' as much as they shuffle as if on a game board.  You don't move freely but instead hop from point to point.  So there is no real exploration to speak of.  The character models during the dialogue are very artistic and very well done, though they have just a few expressions.The story is good, though nothing original.  The characters are all very endearing though, and the supporting cast is quite lively and entertaining.  Even the demons have a grim humor about them.  But you will find yourself rooting for the good guys and genuinely concerned about the fate of the heroes.You follow each of the main characters from level 1 to 10 in order.  This gives you the chance to control a good variety of unit types: (elves, knights, undead, demons, etc...).  Each unit has a unique ability, stats, and levels up (as a unit type, not each individual unit).  You receive unlimited core units, but have to purchase the Elite and Champion units.  I found the most difficulty was in winning battles while keeping your Elite units alive (if they die, they're gone for good until you buy more).  Some of the puzzle battles are fun, but once you have a good grasp of the battle mechanics, they can be rather easy.The music is among the best on the DS, though it contains a limited number of scores.  I would say that the quality is only rivaled by Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.This is a worthy DS game and a game that does find a good home on the DS.  Just note that it is easier to differentiate the units on the DSI XL.Pros: good story, fun and inventive battle system, music, save anytime option (while not in battle), lot's of random encounters that are skip-able.Cons: cheesy game board interface with shuffling character sprites, sometimes too easy, other times very challenging, CPU very predictable.Worth an addition to any DS library.Update 3/3:  Finished the game.  Pretty good, though towards the end you don't get to select your hero (out of the four).  Not a lot of extras so once the game is done there isn't much point in playing unless you battle online or quick battles against CPU.  Lacks the depth and replay value of other traditional RPGs.  It is fun to play battles on the vs mode, but since there aren't really any additional unlockables, side quests or alternate endings on the main story mode, there isn't much else to gain from subsequent plays through.  But it's still fun to play the vs mode. =)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0037LTTRO","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Rainbox Six: Vegas meets Ghost Recon","reviewText":"Ghost Recon Future soldier is a new direction for the Tom Clancy games, that's for sure.  I was a big fan of Advanced Warfighter 2.  I enjoyed managing the battlefield assets, while being engaged in the battlefield at the same time.  I also enjoyed the ability to progress through missions in many different ways.  I enjoyed the Rainbox Six: Vegas games because of their cover-to-cover intensive shooter action.  To a lesser degree I enjoyed some of the basic stealth-creeper action of some of the Splinter Cell games.  GRFS is an interesting mix of these attributes.GRFS will go from stealth-infiltration to run-and-gun battlefield action in a split second.  Over all I found the game to be fairly \"arcadey\".  You have a squad with you, and the friendly AI is pretty good.  The friendly AI really never hurts you -- only helps you.  They don't really get caught during stealth missions, they are pretty decent in combat, and only rarely need to be revived on the battlefield.  I think the developers went out of their way to make sure they aren't a burden.  Besides the \"Sync Shot\" stuff, you can't really control them.  In that regard, I kind of miss GRAW2.The cover system is worth mentioning.  It is fantastic.  It works very well, especially when moving from cover to cover, dynamically, on the battlefield.  The peeking/leaning around cover, targeting your next piece of cover, and hustling to it -- all work fantastic.  Hats off to the developers.The stealth mechanic is a bit over-used in the game, but still works well.  You'll realize very quickly that you are practically invisible, unless an enemy is very near to you and looking directly at you.  You realize the horror of facing an active-camo enemy when you start running into them later in the game.  Pretty fun.The game plot is pretty run of the mill, but still interesting.  The missions are varied enough that they don't get repetitive.  In many of the missions the progression is linear, but in some you have the option of approaching them more from a stealth or front attack perspective.  Many times you mix a bit to get through.I played a tiny bit of the multiplayer.  I don't buy these games for the multiplayer, but it didn't leave a bad impression on me.  The cover system and gameplay seems identical to the single player, which is a step above the multiplayer experience in the GRAW games.  I expect fans of multiplayer action will get a ton of mileage from it.In conclusion, while the game isn't perfect, it was definitely a very good experience.  If you are already a fan of the Tom Clancy games, you'll likely enjoy this.  If you haven't gotten into these kinds of games yet, you may very well find this one to be a good introduction.  It is light-weight, but tactical.  It is unencumbered, but challenging.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2012"}

I'm glad I did, though. With this game, Nintendo has tackled yet another genre with aplomb, adding FPS to a list that already includes platformers (Mario), action/adventures (Zelda), and RPGs (Pokemon and Paper Mario).I loved the approach to first-person combat. The controls are smooth as silk, and make it easy to move and shoot at the same time. Weapon and visor switching can be done at the press of a button. Overall, I found the game's controls very easy to master. The game itself, however, was another matter.The level of difficulty here fried my nerves to no end. I would walk carefully through an area, my heart beating frantically as I wondered when the next group of space pirates was going to leap down and ruthlessly attack me. There are almost no \"grunt\"-type enemies in the game. Each and every one proves a genuine threat. And don't even get me started on the bosses--not only do they make you know fear with their rabid behavior, but they'll decimate you within seconds if you're screwing around. You'll cry with relief every time you reach a checkpoint and can save your progress. I would reccomend buying a strategy guide so you can figure out where to go and where the power-ups are, but even when you know what to do, it doesn't make doing it any easier. Without a doubt, this is the most intense, nerve-racking, scary, and difficult game I have ever played. And then you can play Hard mode, if you enjoy pain.So with all that, why do I still adore this game? Well, whenever I would actually get to a save point/beat a boss/get a power-up/etc., I would feel like the bomb. Even though I used a strategy guide, I still felt like an uber-gamer every time I accomplished something.You've heard me mention power-ups several times now. Well, there's a reason for that: they rock. Torching fools with my Heat Ray is one of the funnest things I've ever done. The Super Missles aren't too shabby either, especially when I shattered that Omega Pirate's knees. The different visors (such as Thermal, X-Ray, etc.) all have neat views. And they're not only cool, they each have puzzle-solving capabilities, so they're useful too. And once you have all the essentials, you can collect the dozens of energy and missle expansions. They're all fun to get, and absoloutely necessary to beating the final boss.As I used all my cool powers, screamed in terror at bosses and regular enemies alike, racked my brain for strategies, navigated the environments (which also rock--they have all kinds of clever nooks and crannies to explore, and the graphics are amazing), whooped with joy when I beat a boss, and investigated the depths of the game's story (there are no cutscenes, but by scanning objects, an interesting plot develops), I realized something: I was not just playing a game. I was having a life experience--one that rivaled any other, \"real-life\" accomplishment. Buy this game, and you too will go on the ride of a lifetime.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2005"}

This tends to be my go-to keyboard of choice as the feedback from the keys is just wonderful.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"Brendan Riley","summary":"Diablo III Is Not Diablo II or I, But Still Good","reviewText":"I have played the Diablo franchise since its inception in the mid 90's ('95 i think?). I even got the expansion for the first Diablo (the name of which escapes me, but it was made by Sierra Studios) and did the same when I got Diablo II (ie Lord of Destruction). I loved those games, and I hate playing games on a computer. But I got Diablo III on PC (not knowing it was coming out on PS3 later) and I couldn't get past Belial because of lag (not because of my internet connection, but because of my computer, a laptop, is not suited for gaming). So when this came out on PS3 I was stoked to play the game as it was intended. There actually isn't a lot of difference in the two versions of the game. There is a bit of lag here and there, where the game suddenly pauses for maybe 5 - 10 seconds, but then it's back in operation. This happens maybe once or twice and hour. NOTHING like what I experienced on my laptop.I'm not fan of any kind of RPGs, generally, despite their popularity, so I can't say that this isn't a strict adherent to one specific genre or not. As I played through it on the console, though, I began to think of it more of an action-adventure game with some RPG attributes to it. Kind of like Badlands was a FPS with some RPG aspects. This is not turn based, thank god, and the action can become very hectic at times. Although, one thing that I DO miss about the first two Diablos is the ability to agonize over \"which attribute do I want to bump up...I need mana..but vitality is gonna keep me alive...but I'm an Amazon..I don't really need THAT much mana..\" etc, ad infinitum.I played as a witch doctor on the PC and kinda started a run through with the barbarian, but on the PS3 I went with the monk. This has been MUCH easier than the PC version, which could be explained by the fact that the witch doctor was a harder class to play as - I don't know. Personally, I liked the easier-ness of it because I, like most people, I'm sure, don't like dying and having to redo stuff over again. It's not so easy that there isn't a challenge, it's just not as literally life-or-death as some other past Diablo experiences have been (like the first major battle in Hell against Azual - that stuff took forever!)All in all, I would say this is a great game, however, with a caveat. If you're a huge fan of Diablo, and want Diablo III to be just like Diablo I and II, but better..it's not. If this game were to take place elsewhere, ie not in Sanctuary or with the Diablo world of lore, then it would be a great standalone game. It just so happens to be attached to the Diablo franchise by names and themes. If you like action games with RPG feels and cool artwork (different, however, from most games these days - it's a little bit cartoonish. Not bad, awesome I think, in fact, but different from games like The Last of Us) or if you want to continue destroying Diablo, who somehow keeps coming back, then this is for you. Besides, who doesn't want to hear Deckard Cain give out his last words with some of the most epic \"old-man\" voice acting for a death scene? Well, thanks friend, for staying awhile, and listening.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

It has been some time since we last saw the tomb raider making her rounds, but in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend, it seems that she has never been away. In fact, with so much improvement in place, it won't be an overstatement to call this game the best Tomb Raider game ever.The story begins with a young Lara meeting with a plane crash with her mother. Eager to solve the mystery of the accident, Lara begins a journey that would take her to several locales. And, as expected, each of these locations provides a festival of platforming and puzzles. Controlling the heroine, your task would be to navigate past these environmental challenges, and of course, taking on some baddies in the process.The platforming sequences in the game won't be much of a problem for the seasoned gamer, especially those who've play a game or two of the Prince of Persia series. Apart from the usual climbing and jumping, Lara also makes use of gadgets like a magnetic grapple to forcefully open locked doors, and to reach to a faraway platform, for example. When taking on enemies, Lara can lock on to an enemy and fire shots at them, giving the opportunity for even a poor aimer like me to enjoy the combat. Her movements are also fluid enough to make the all these feel like second nature.In addition, the puzzles in this game are mostly simple enough to crack, but some may require more logic than simply pulling a lever. Mastering the environment and its possibilities will therefore make your job much easier as you progress through the game. But, just in case you fall to your death, the game also has many checkpoints within a given level to allow you to save your progress, so you won't have to restart from the beginning of the level again should your game comes to an abrupt end.With a limited number of levels, the game suffers in terms of play time. You can probably complete it over the course of a weekend if you aren't keen to collect all the rewards that are littered throughout the game. These rewards come in the form of gold, silver and bronze medals, and finding them will unlock special items. Some of them can be found in broad daylight, but the others, especially the gold ones, may require some serious exploration. You can also revisit a level after you complete it to play a time trial game for that particular level, and completing the level in a given time frame will also unlock rewards. These add-ons are probably include to encourage replayability, since the game is really rather short.Graphics wise, Tomb Raider: Legend will satisfy even the greatest critics. The details are amazing to look at, and the game isn't shy to show them off right from the beginning when Lara was shown doing an Ethan Hunt cliff-hanging sequence a la Mission Impossible II. The environments are truly breath-taking to behold in that cut-scene alone, and it's not the only time you'll feel that way throughout the game. The audios are also an excellent example of how things should be done. The voice-overs are apt, the music is enjoyable, and even the sound effects are purposefully blended to complement the levels. All these add to a very satisfying playing experience.Overall, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend is a competent title to resurrect a franchise that has long been thought to be over the hill. It may not produce a long, epic adventure; nor does it throw too much difficult challenge in the face of the player. Its simplicity and great presentations, however, make it an immersive game to engage, and therefore, easy to recommend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2006"}

I found it to be an interesting take on the FPS that emphasized escape over combat. Conceptually it is superior to many other games in the genre, although a lot of the levels became redundant over time, as the game is quite short and playing time trials gets old. Still, it is a good-great game depending on your preferences, and one that I would gladly have thrown more money at when it moved to PC, since I am a PC gaming fanatic.Sadly I won't be adding it to my collection of PC games, at least not the version you can get off a store shelf or order from Amazon (more on that to follow). You see, this is another game in the lengthening list of EA PC releases that comes with its own malignant piece of Malware: Securom 7x.First off, in case you've never heard of Securom 7x, it is a DRM scheme (Digital Rights Management) that EA states is intended to counter piracy of their games. They argue it is necessary and that without it they will loose all their revenue to piracy.The reality is that it does NOTHING to counter piracy. Want proof? Check into how soon after its releaseSporewas cracked by pirates. The answer is it was cracked THE DAY BEFORE its release! Basically computer hackers are much more imaginative than the programmers hired to create DRM schemes. They can and will hack ANYTHING released by EA. SPORE, CRYSIS WARHEAD, RED ALERT II, DEAD SPACE, etc., can all be found right now on torrent sites. Regardless of what EA says, don't be fooled: Securom IS NOT ABOUT PREVENTING PIRACY.I'm not a fan of piracy, and never ever recommend pirating anything. I own hundreds of games. I've been buying them for over 15 years across many platforms including the PC. I'm the guy that will buy games the day they are released, or buy collectors editions of games I already own at additional cost. I sink thousands of dollars into gaming each and every year. I'm more than willing to buy games even at premium prices.So why won't I buy this or any other game that comes loaded with Securom? Because aside from failing at preventing piracy, Securom has some really nasty attributes:1. It is as hard to uninstall as a computer virus. Think uninstalling the game will remove it? Not so much. It will stay on your computer until you follow a series of steps that require a high degree of computer skill to accomplish. Unless you are familiar with manually modifying your registry, it is not an easy process. I know. I had to remove it after installing MASS EFFECT on my computer a while back.2. Creates security vulnerabilities for your PC. Because the program has ring-0 access (the highest level of access, higher that computer administrator) to your computer, it can be used by EA to data mine, or by someone who has cracked it (possibly the same pirates who instantly crack EA titles) to access your data and filed. This is a huge issue for me. I am the administrator of my computer, and no secretly installed DRM program should have the right to undermine my PC's safety.3. Gives EA control over when and how often you can install the game. Requires your computer to 'phone home' to the EA authentication server each time you want to install. If EA ever decides that they're done supporting that server and you want to install, well guess what? You're SOL.4.Stomps all over your consumer rights. You think you own that game you just bought? Nope. You just own the right to play it for as long as EA thinks you should, and only install it as many times as they want you to. Like renting movies? Well get used to it if you want to play EA games, because from now on, and with every Securom 7x game in the future, that is what you will be doing. Renting.5. A very similar program was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court:\"Installations of secret software that create security risks are intrusive and unlawful,\" said FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras. \"Consumers' computers belong to them, and companies must adequately disclose unexpected limitations on the customary use of their products so consumers can make informed decisions regarding whether to purchase and install that content.\"SO WHAT CAN YOU AND I DO ABOUT THIS?The answer is simple: don't buy anything from EA until they get rid of Securom 7x once and for all. I won't be buying this game, or Crysis Warhead, or Dead Space, or any number of other games that I otherwise would because I refuse to let EA treat me like a criminal. I am not a pirate, never will be, nor am I into letting EA (big brother) have root access to my computer. If enough of us choose to spend our money on other games (The Witcherfor example) that don't come infested with this DRM crap, maybe just maybe EA will change its ways. And if not, at least we've contributed to independent game makers who understand that we want to pay for great games, but not let them put a DRM ring in our computer's noses.*******A note about the Steam version of Mirror's Edge*******Ironically, EA is now offering virtually all of their top releases on Steam. You can get yourself a DRM free version, but only if you install Steam. Doesn't make much sense; just a year ago EA said they would not release games to Steam. Not ever. Now that debacles like the Spore release have hit their profits in a huge way, it looks like they're desperate enough to start offering up a superior version of their games through a rival distribution company! Doesn't make much sense. They could make so much more by just releasing a DRM free version 'over the counter' through Amazon and the like.Amazon supports DRM free music, maybe it's time they start applying the same rules to PC games. Here's hoping that they do.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2009"}

Its no as fun or interesting as Dead Rising was starting out as with that you had varous types of weapons you could use in Dead Island the start feels very linear and it feels like you are going through killing zombies in preset locations they basically are on the ground then \"get up\" when you are near them. It really feels more like whack a zombie as the first part is basically you got a oar or a pipe and you use it to whap a zombie till it \"dies\" its fun after a few zombies but then starts to get a little old i was hoping for a more open ended feel plus areas at the start feels sectioned off so you really are going down a \"path\" not really feeling its very open.  I enjoyed Dead Rising 2 more in my opinion. Even with the updates.i will say with the latest update i had no major problems running the game. graphics seem to run fine and the game does look pretty graphics wise just wish there was more of a feeling of openness and less of whack a zombie.

{"product_name":"B0009IX7K8","reviewerName":"R. Wiedlin","summary":"Overall a great game, but with a few additions I could do without","reviewText":"The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games. With creation of GTA 3, games became increasingly more violent and more controversal. San Andreas is no exception.If this game did not bear the GTA tag, I probably would have rated it higher, but needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed with what rockstar did with this addition to the GTA series. Previous GTAs all had a quirky jab at political and social icons (particularly conversation political and social icons). San Andreas had this, but to a much lesser extent which disappointed me.Another thing which disappointed me about this game was the RPG-like system they put into it. Your accuracy is determined by how often you practice, rather than the players ablity to shoot. Also, unlike previous GTAs, you must now press a button  and slow your walking speed down to manually aim and fire a gun. I HATED this change in the gameplay. This severely limits your ablity to go on rampages, and forces you to use their god-awful auto aim system. If they had not added this function to the game, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.That being said, there were PLENTY of things I enjoyed about this game. First off, I enjoyed the new depth theyve added to missions. Previously missions were as followed: Kill this, blow up that, run way from these guys, and avoid cops. Missions in this game actually feel like Rockstar put a lot of time into each individual objective. One Mission that particularly comes to mind is the mission where you hop on a plane, have a small shootout on the INSIDE of the vehicle, then fly to liberty cities (a location that you cannot travel to normally) and assassinate some crime bosses. Little things like this show the extra effort the designers put into the game.Another thing I enjoyed about this game is that it is more challengeing than previous GTAs. The very last mission will have you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing from the firetruck missions. This game is designed at a skill level for someone who has been playing GTA a long time.Also the map is friggin huge! Its about 3 times the size of your regular GTA game. However, unlike previous GTAs, its not packed with little goodies and have special jumps at every corner. Its still fun to explore every corner of the map in this game though.So now for the break down of my reviewPros-Incredibly large map-Challengeing-More new vehicles to hijack-An overall improvement on the missions-Plenty of extra features-GANG WARS-Good voice actingThe Cons-New style of shooting is a huge hinderance-Areas are not as packed with goodies as before-Fewer political cheap shots than SA's predcisoursOverall I would give this game a 8 out of 10 in comparison to video games everywhere, but only 4 out of 10 when compared to its predecesors (5 being average).One other note: If you have an ATI Radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game (not with lag, but with actually loading the game).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2006"}

I am NOT one for nostalgia when it comes to video games (or much of anything, for that matter), but even the most hardcore nostalgic fans will be hard-pushed to enjoy mind-blowing garbage like Joust or Spy Hunter 2.The other half of the games on this collection ARE actually quite good, but the PS3 is not the platform for them. The arcade, with arcade controls, and arcade screens, is where they belong and they plain and simple do not translate well to home consoles. I love APB, and Toobin' is fun, and SMASH TV is awesome, but they were not designed for a PlayStation controller in mind.Not only that, but Midway's best ever game, NARC, is not included. What on Earth were they thinking leaving this classic off the collection? It would be the only one that WOULD work perfect on the PS3 and yet they leave it off? Madness!All trophies are based on Score Attack mode, not Arcade mode, which makes hunting the harder ones (hard mainly because of the terrible controls) all the more infuriating. It's tough to rate the graphics and sound since they are all from different parts of the 80s, but the overall presentation is nice.Midway should instead just release some of their better games on the PSN with full trophy support and avoid collections like this.

If you want you can check my profile, I will be posting a review of the version I bought. I bought the limited edition one. The reason I am reviewing the standard is this:A. It is basically the same game (minus a couple unlockables)B. I love telling people about great gamesC. I am tired of spam unfair reviews.Letter c is the real reason I decided to write this. At the time of writing this review, there is one person who has reviewed this game, on all three editions, and gave the same 1 star review on all three editions. If you click on his profile, it is full of them. On 6 playstation games, he has given one star reviews with bad reasons.Now to the actual game:For a couple of months now I have been waiting for this game, and I am not disappointed. This shows off what we will come to expect from our next gen systems. With just 5 months after the launch of the ps4, we do no longer await greatness, greatness is here. The graphics are the best that I know of anywhere. This is no lie, they are absolutely stunning. I have not played a more graphically advanced game ever. Since it is an exclusive, the developers could really focus on one system, and they really brought out the big guns.Secondly, the story mode is great. After the first two Infamous games, I was sad to see our main character go. It does not matter because we have been brought another lovable figure. I have started to grow onto him already! The use of features like neon and smoke are great. It lets you personalize how you like to get around.Cole will be missed, but Delsin is a great replacement! Really though, this is a must have for PS4. I wasn't a single player game person till I played inFAMOUS 2. Now I love them.  I have not experienced any frame rate drops, or mistimed lip syncs.Pros-Open worldStunning graphics (again the best I have ever witnessed)New power ups (like smoke and neon)Great story line that you expect in a single player gameCons-In all honesty, I wouldn't add anything to this side. I'm afraid if I changed anything I wouldn't love this game as I do now. If you leave a comment with some cons, I will be sure to include them if they are reasonable. I am looking forward so much to this game!I cannot stress how much this game rocks! It is a staple to the ps4 in my opinion, but what do I know?I will be posting some gameplays on my YouTube channel if you are still undecided, or just wanna watch some of Infamous Second Son!

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Cristoper Najar Herrera","summary":"Awesome game","reviewText":"A lot of people say this game is like having God Of War for the 360. Well... the game has a similar gameplay but definitely the storyline is way different. I read the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri and let me tell you, the game is way more enjoyable if you read the book first. So from the book's perspective, this game is a very good approach. Of course the game does not cover all topics from the book but still the main thing is there.I personally like all these hellish and demonic themes. Dante's Inferno portrays in a good way all this inferno world. There are scary parts like when you arrive to the Limbo and you meet these babies with hooks instead of arms... and when you hit them, you listen them crying as newborn babies... damn... this is scaring. You see also people trapped in the walls, all of them mourning and crying. So in a way this game depicts the experience of being in hell, for sure a terrible place. There are putrid corpses all around, blood and fluids, impaled people, and a lot of satanic environments. I just love it :)There are interesting things in the gameplay such as collecting souls and exchanging them for new abilities, once in a while and after certain combats you get some sorts of magic and from time to time you find people that must be absolved or punished. Depending on your decisions through the game, your virtue or evil will grow, allowing you to reach new abilities for each mood.Yesterday I was playing and I came to a point when Beatrice, Dante's wife, was being kissed by Lucifer in an spectacular cinematic. God ... this game is dark... very dark.If you play it fast, maybe you'll see the game falls short but I like to take my time to see every detail on screen... so for me the game's length is fine. The bosses are hard to beat, so you'll have your hands busy with this game. The colors, sounds and graphics in general are amazing.The game is definitely worth its price. I recommend it if you like dark themes and of course if you are a dedicated gamer. Don't think about the God of War thing, you'll enjoy this game as much as you have enjoyed your GOW.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2010"}

But there's more to it than that.I recognize that gamers with more patience than I will figure out how to avoid the bad guys, but it drove me bananas.  Ducking behind cover should have hid me, and it didn't.  Hiding around a corner after teleporting away from attackers should have protected me, but it didn't.  For a &#34;non-linear&#34; game, it seemed like there were only two options: plowing through people or watching the load screen over and over and over and over and over until I could finally figure out through sheer repetition what I was &#34;supposed&#34; to do.That left me getting caught a lot, and then I was left with a rather unsatisfying combat mode.  And even if I won combat, I lost, because the game penalized you for racking up a body count of soldiers just doing their jobs.I guess that when I see Bethesda, I remember the 100+ hours I spent on Fallout 3 and forget how dry and disappointed I was with Oblivion and New Vegas.

Malone","summary":"Halo-- the little game that taught me to love again","reviewText":"The organization I work for used to be Mac based. Therefore, back in the mid-90s we played a lot of Marathon on our LAN. It was more or less the Mac's answer to the PC's Doom, but it was far more cerebral. It told a complex tale through the eyes and text of computer AIs which guided you through the game. While the network co-worker vs. co-worker games were sinfully fun, the single player game was also incredibly engrossing. Shortly after the Marathon 2 demo was out, a bunch of us had to shift from Mac to PC due to some software issues. No more Marathon for us. Sometime later Quake hit, and that became our LAN game of choice. The single player mode was OK, but nowhere near as engaging as Marathon's. I also played lots of FPSs on my home consoles, like Disruptor and Tenka on the PSX, Turok and Goldeneye on the N64. Turok was my favorite of the console FPSs; rather than the almost non-existant story drawing me in, it was the environments, level layouts, graphics, and sheer game play that grabbed me. It also introduced what I considered to be the perfect home console FPS control scheme ever devised, i.e. using the analog stick to control looking. I couldn't believe it when Goldeneye didn't use it as the default setup. Turok 2 was the last FPS I really got into. I loved it, but it was such a grueling, herculean task of a game. Beating it nearly killed me, and I was utterly and completely burned out on the entire FPS genre when I finished it. I tried getting into Perfect Dark when it came out, but I just couldn't. I played it for a few levels, then it became a dust collector. Even System Shock 2 failed to engage me. The point of all of this is, when Halo was heralded as \"perhaps the greatest FPS ever\" my response was \"No thanks, I'm done with those games.\" I was so burned out that even the fact that it was made by the same developer that made Marathon wasn't enough to get me interested. (Yet I did somehow play a lot of Quake III and Counterstrike at one point because one of my friends had an oddly contagious addiction to them...)I didn't have any plans to buy an Xbox for a long time. Eventually it was announced that a new Panzer Dragoon game, created by original members of Team Andromeda, would be an Xbox exclusive. That was when I knew that I'd be buying an Xbox someday. Last week, I used my lunch hour to run to a game shop to buy a game. The game I wanted wasn't in stock. Not wanting to leave empty handed, I decided to get my looming Xbox purchase out of the way. The clerk asked me if I wanted a game with it, but I hadn't given that any thought. He recommended Halo, and I replied that I wasn't really interested in an FPS. He seemed genuinely shocked and warned me that I would probably be the only Xbox owner in the world who didn't have a copy of Halo. I ended up buying Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams, even though I'd already played it on PS2. (My drooling fanboy anticipation of the just-announced Silent Hill 3 made me do it. And it has a little extra scenario that wasn't in the PS2 version.) When I got back to my office, buyer's remorse kicked in and so I started reading up on Halo since I knew virtually nothing about it. Warm and fuzzy Marathon nostalgia washed over me. Suddenly the idea of playing a new FPS didn't seem so ponderous. I only had to read a couple of Halo reviews before I decided to give it a try. Thank God I did. I've been playing this game non-stop for over a week now. Even if Panzer Dragoon were never to hit the Xbox, my purchase of the console has already been justified. The story may not be *quite* as heady as Marathon's, it's still an excellent sci-fi story, better than most you'd find in an action game.I've played nearly every FPS ever released, and it's been a long time since I've seen one this fresh. The epic environments, the satisfying weapons, the perfectly-tuned controls, the dastardly AI, the innovative health and weapon carrying systems, the hilarious random in-battle dialogue coming from both your allies and your enemies, the classic sci-fi story... this game delivers on every level. And I haven't even touched the multiplayer yet. I can hardly believe it's on a console rather than a personal computer. Do not pass on this game. I can't stop playing it, and can already tell I'll be playing it for a long time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2002"}

As Daxter is an ottsel and not a human, players will have a unique moveset with agile abilities, as Daxter can crawl on all fours, fit in small places and maneuver vehicles. You'll need all those abilities to get through this unique platformer!","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Daxter Sets the Bar for PSP 3D Platforming","reviewText":"This is a revelation for the Jak and Daxter series, as well as the PSP.  It's Daxter getting his own title, and it's a game for the PSP that overall sets the bar on many standards.  Simply put, this is one of the best PSP titles ever to emerge, and it's a fantastic game.Before Jak II, Daxter had an adventure of his own.  One where he protected the citizens of Haven City from bugs.  That's right, bugs, and to show for it, his main weapon is an electric flyswatter.  The story is simplistic, but that doesn't mean the game losses edge or momentum.  The game still maintains its humor, in this title even more so than before.The mission based system is not really any different than Jak II or Jak 3.  If you've played those two titles, you'll be right at home with Daxter, as the set up isn't much different.  Each mission consists of a primary objective that you'll have to complete.  Usually they're killing enemies or destroying a hive or something to the effect.  The secondary objectives in each mission are optional, and they're reminiscent of Jak and Daxter titles.  You'll be collecting metal bugs and/or precursor orbs in secondary mission objectives.  You only have to complete the primary objective to move on and advance the story.  You can always comeback and do those secondary objectives later, and sometimes that may be better.  You'll have better equipment by then usually.  The game actually works in a way that you probably will end up coming back to a level with better equipment to get these things.As you go through these levels you'll be using either Daxter's flyswatter or an insecticide spray.  Both are fun to use.  His sprayer even gets upgrades as levels progress, which is pretty neat.  Daxter can do many different sorts of things in each level as well.  He's got a double jump, he can climb certain walls, and he can even use his sprayer as a hover device.  The gameplay mechanics are fluent and precise.The gameplay doesn't stop there either.  Throughout some levels, Daxter will find himself having to do a multitude of things.  Jump from moving trains and platforms, finding a \"zoomer\" that will allow him to catch up with certain enemies and much more.  There are also plenty of mini-game sequences that tend to borrow from movies.  Not much in the gameplay is original, but to be honest, it isn't about original gameplay, it's about how well you get it to work.  Daxter gets the gameplay working extremely well.  The elements are perfectly balanced.  The gameplay never lets up, and it's always fun to play.  You'll always be glad to come back to this game.  The gameplay is never stale, either.The only two elements that seem to bog this game down are the learning curve and camera angles.  The control schemes takes a moment to get used to.  Once you do, however, the game becomes very fluent.  The camera needs work, but it still works and doesn't detract from the gameplay really.There's also a multiplayer game.  A bug combat game.  Throughout your adventure you'll find lots of different items and goodies that you'll be able to use in bug combat.  Bug combat is a neat mini game that allows you to send your bug into battle and battle against either the computer or a friend.  It works out very well.  There is no point to the bug combat, but it does make for a nice relaxing break from the main game.The most obvious thing about Daxter are the graphics.  This is by far the best looking game on the PSP.  This really shows how graphically powerful the PSP is.  No framerate issues, everything looks stellar, vibrant and colorful.  This game shows what means to be walking around with a PS2 in your pocket.  The sound is also very good and fluent.  One of the best sounding games on the PSP as well.  The voice acting, needless to say, is top-notch.  Of the best in the gaming world.Simply put, this is one of the best games ever to hit the PSP.  As far as I'm concerned, this has set the standard for platforming PSP games to come.  Graphically it's the best PSP game out there, and gameplay wise, nothing comes close on the PSP.  Daxter sets the bar for what a stellar PSP game should be.The Good+OUTSTANDING Presentation!  The graphics are without a doubt, THE BEST on the PSP.+The Gameplay is without a doubt the best on the PSP.  It never gets stale, repetative or boring.+Outstanding voice acting+Plenty of extra minigames and collecting+Fluent controlsThe Bad-The camera lacks in some areas-While the controls are fluent, they'll take time to get used toThis is a game that every PSP owner should have.

Oblivion's four Guilds, Mages, Fighters, Thieves, and Dark Brotherhood all have their own unique questlines and provide opportunity for added perks. Designed to be an open-ended experience, Oblivion's biggest draw is its massive world. Set in Cyrodiil, a province of the larger land of Tamriel, practically everything is accessible right from the start. You can head in any direction you like, playing to beat the story, to complete side quests, or wander around fields, mountains and streams exploring at your own pace.The story missions are great and there are tons of excellent sideline content that keeps you entertained as well. The Guilds, for instance, all have their own stories and the Arena in the Imperial City where you can engage in mortal combat with one, two or even three enemies at a time for cash rewards.The game has a very intuitive map and easy to use quest log and you can fast travel as long as you have visited the location first around Cyrodiil.

Later on in the game, you'll unlock a body slam, and the ability to grapple enemies. But again, this is a platformer that really doesn't focus on combat.  My guess is if you're taking an interest in this game, its probably not because of the combat ;-)Weaponry - I normally wouldn't associate interesting weapons with this type of platformer, but Puppeteer offered some unusual ones. Your main weapon is a pair of scissors. As I mentioned earlier, there are not that many bad guys to fight, but the scissors become necessary during boss battles, and traversing through the levels. Another weapon you'll discover is a magical shield that can be temporarily used to make you invincible and also toss back projectiles. My favorite weapon is the bomb. It's simplistic, but I like it. When you throw it at an enemy, they'll pick it up and juggle it until it explodes and kills them. How could you not be fond of that?Enemies - If Puppeteer does have a weakness, you could argue that it's enemy variety. If memory serves, I believe there's only two enemy types in the entire game (excluding bosses). I'm not sure how to describe it, but one of the types is some kind of fuzzy creature, and the other is a giant flower that shoots laser beams. Creative, huh? It's very important to keep in mind that this genre of game rarely has several enemy types. The environment itself is the most formidable enemy that you'll encounter. I found the boss battles to be clever, varied, and challenging - But never frustrating. In these types of games, it's quite difficult to make boss battles challenging, without being frustrating. Puppeteer nailed that balancing act; kudos to them.Miscellaneous - If you're the type of gamer that enjoys long cut scenes, you'll fall in love with Puppeteer! Now, I don't like cut scenes, so I usually day dream during them, or simply skipped them. In regards to length, I'd estimate about 12 to 15 hours. There are 21 levels, and they're average length, and they all look different. I hate side scrollers that put little effort in the level design *COUGHS dragon's crown COUGHS* I apologize, I just received my flu shot, and it usually makes me sick the first couple of days... Exploration is very limited, however, you can collect different 'heads' to wear throughout your journey. These are some pretty awesome looking heads! You'll see anything from a Penguin head, to my personal favorite Grim Reaper head! Each head has a special power that allows you to unlock a bonus area and collect extra coins, no biggie.Hey, don't be turned off by the cute cover, or because it's a side scroller. Come on gamers, take a chance in life, what's it gonna hurt? The PS3 is on its last legs anyway, why not go out with a BANG?

If developers can continue to make games that implement this device at least half as proficiently as an early game such as Tiger Woods 2010, I have very high hopes for this product.  The device makes a night and day difference in the sensitivity and responsiveness of the motion controls.  I really hope more developers keep producing games that utilize this device, because I'm hooked.PROS:+++ Increased controller sensitivity and responsiveness+++ Comes with a new silicone sleeve for your controller+++ Gives the Wii Remote a heavier, more solid feel.CONS:--- Limited number of games that support the device (but this number should hopefully grow)--- Additional cost.  Nintendo officially has the most expensive controller if you count the Wii Remote ($40), Nunchuck ($20), and Motion Plus ($20).If you want to own a game that requires the Motion Plus, you don't really have a choice and are pretty much forced to buy one of these.  If you own a game that has the option of using Motion Plus, I highly recommend that you purchase one of these little gems.

Malone","summary":"Great while it lasts ~ Quality vs. Quantity","reviewText":"Killzone 3 makes me question my practice of purchasing FPSes solely for single player. I finished the campaign in two brief sessions, on Veteran difficulty. Couldn't have taken more than six hours, maybe seven. I enjoyed the hell out of it while it lasted... it's a very well designed and fun campaign with a surprising amount of variety considering its brevity. If I was the sort who finished the campaign as quickly as possible and then plays online multiplayer for weeks into months, there would be no issue I suppose. I won't go so far as to say that I regret buying this game. I'll go back and replay it a few times down the road. I've noticed quite a bit of criticism of the story... I admit, I didn't pay much attention... I didn't play this game for its story, which has always been light and cursory in these games. I've been a Killzone fan since the first in 2004 and this most certainly delivers a great Killzone experience... but if you blink you'll miss it.EDIT Aug 2013: Replaying this now in anticipation of the PS4 launching this year with Shadow Fall. I notice that I never mentioned how beautiful Killzone 3 was in terms of visual design. The jungle level is a real standout, one of the most vivid alien landscapes I've seen in a while. The Helghast interior levels are also very easy on the eyes (if you like cold hi-tech environments.) And I must say, the gun play in this game is much more satisfying than I recall. However after having just replayed Killzone 2 as well, I feel compelled to say that overall I think Killzone 2 is the superior game. The first two Killzones carved out a unique niche that was sort of 90% gritty military shooter and 10% futuristic sci-fi. (As opposed to Resistance, which is more like 50/50.) Killzone 3 veers towards sci-fi in several ways, and perhaps lost a bit of dignity in the process.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

Judging by the trailers and magazine ads, the sequel to the PlayStation 2 smash hit, Devil May Cry, it looked very cool. And it was the day I got it and the strategy guide. Wall flipping and multi-directional shooting was very fun and easy to pull off. Unfortunately, it wore off soon enough and after a few months( and beating the superior first one on both difficulties ), I realized how shallow and disappointing DMC2 was. Ignoring the confusing and laughable storyline, even the gameplay is watered down. The game plays likes it on the Easy Automatic difficulty of the first. And don't be fooled by the other difficulties. The only real challenge lies in the Dante Must Die or Lucia Must Die, and even so, it's nowhere near as challenging as the first. You get 3 different swords, but your first one serves a better purpose than the other 2, despite what the guide says. And they lack any kind of personality and level of coolness like Ifrit or Alastor. Guns consist of your trademark pistols, shotgun, sub-machine guns( which is, in my opinion, the worst set of weapons to have on here ) and a rocket launcher. Now, due to the open levels, which are pretty dull most of them, you'll practically be using your guns a majority of the time instead of the swords, and that sucks. The 2nd disc is the other character's story, Lucia, who is almost like Dante, but a little better, a little worse in some aspects. She doesn't have any guns, save for the bowgun. She carries swords, sticky bombs and throwing daggers. The best thing about her is you actually have to use her melee combat moves over her projectile weapons, unlike Dante, which is the opposite. Like I said earlier, wall running and jumping is cool, but it serves NO purpose whatsoever. It just there for decoration. Voice-acting is even worse than the first with Dante spewing out the most generic one-liners I've ever heard. Now, for all the horrible things I've said about this bland sequel, there are a few redeeming qualites. One is the graphics are quite good and the CG is great. There is a ton to unlock like secret characters and an endless dungeon. And both Lucia and Dante aren't all that bad to play as. Hopefully, they'll get it right in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, which looks infinitely better that this, and reclaim the fun and cool factor of the first. I give a terrible 2 out of 5. Tis a sad day indeed. This is Sean David, signing off.Until then,Semper Fi, Carry on.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2004"}

{"product_name":"B009S4JTTC","description":"","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun, But Still Disappointing","reviewText":"This game is a lot different from regular \"Ratchet and Clank\" games.  It is actually a \"tower defense\" kind of game, where you defend a base from enemies.  You can play as Ratchet, Clank, or Qwark, and you visit several planets.  You have a base you must defend, and you must keep enemies from destroying your generators.  You can buy mines, turrets, and barriers to defend your base.  Plus, you can use your own weapons to fight enemies.  This game features weapons from previous games.  No new ones.  In order to finish a planet, you must explore a decent-sized area and activate or destroy several things on the planet, while keeping enemies from destroying all your generators.One thing I find very odd in this game is how you get weapons.  You find these devices on the planet, and each one gives you a choice of one weapon out of sometimes several.  Every time you go to a planet, you start with no weapons and must get them back.  It's strange.  Luckily, every time you start a new planet or switch characters, the weapons retain their level (you can level them up to a maximum of level 3).While I was disappointed this game is not like the usual \"Ratchet and Clank\" game, I still thought it was fun.  I did have fun playing something I don't normally play, and I found it rather satisfying keeping enemies away from my base and making my base nice and secure.  There is a variety of different barriers, mines, and turrets you can set up, (for example, there were mines that turned enemies into bunnies and mines that made enemies dance) and since you don't need to spend money on guns, you can spend it all on fixing generators and making your base secure.  The locations to explore were fun, too, as they were a decent size, and there were many paths to check out.  The game could be fairly challenging at times, too.Unfortunately, while I still thought the game could be fun, it did disappoint me.  I wish this game was more like the traditional \"Ratchet and Clank\" games.  It's also very short, and there are only three planets, one of which you go to three times.  Also, there was almost no story, and what little story there was is not that great.  The games usually have a much better story than that.So while I did have fun with the game, it can still be rather disappointing to people who are fans of the regular \"Ratchet and Clank\" games.  I think many fans could still have fun playing this game, but it's so short, it's almost not worth the money.  Unless you like this style of game, I would suggest not buying it and just save your money for another traditional \"Ratchet and Clank\" game (which I hope they'll make in the near future).  (And I'm surprised this is all they decided to do with the series' 10-year anniversary.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2013"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

I have no complaints.Frame rates flowed smoothly with no lag so far.Sound is very good with weapons sounding different and background sound varies with location.I have a lot of hearing loss but the game sounded good without having to crank up the TV.I am still playing the campaign,which in a lot of games is way to short.I am happy with the length so far.The storyline is decent and keeps ones interest.There is a lot of cussing and sexual and alcohol use/references in this game.So be warned if one is offended by that.There are some good one liners and insults in this game which had me laughing while fragging.The cut scenes were entertaining and short.Control is  similar to COD.Likes:Weapons vary sniper rifle is my favorite.Skill shot system is great as is the leash weapon.Sound is good IMO.Graphics are great also like the story line.The campaign seems to be of a decent length.Dislikes:Both enemy and ally AI could have been better.I sometimes found myself getting overrun and my allies just sat there.Would have liked a free roam enviorment and the ability to destroy buildings like BF Bad Co 1&2.Overall:Fun factor of 5 just thinking of ways to kill enemies will keep the game from getting repetitive.I played for 6 hours and have not completed the campaign yet which is a plus.I think both hardcore shooter and casual gamers will enjoy this game as much as I have.I give it a thumbs up.Note:I have not tried multi-player yet so my apologies.Update 2/24/11Progressed far in the game.Weapon upgrades are awesome and helps one get points.No glitches detected so far.My only other complaint is no vehicle missions yet.One gets to be a gunner, but not operate a vehicle.Warning:Some racial slurs are used in this game FYI.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2011"}

Boucher \"God punishes us for the th...","summary":"Contender for game of the year.","reviewText":"Disclaimer: I'm not a multi-player fan and therefore my review doesn't take it into consideration.Strap on your armor and load your lancer, because you are now on earths final mission to save itself from the Locust.From the moment you fire-up the single player campaign to the end credits, GOW2 is a major step-up from its predocessor. The first thing you'll notice is the improvement in graphics as well as some new finishing moves for downed enemies. The first thing I noticed was that Dom was no longer a retard just running into enemies and getting killed. Another nice touch is that the AI members can also revive you from death by running over and saving you. You can also rapidly press A to crawl over to them -- take too much time though and its game over.The game play was really enjoyable. You still only play as Marcus, but you have a lot more AI characters aiding you this time. The story is massive and very emotional. You almost feel battle-worn and exhausted while playing and there are a few points in the game where the emotions really kick-in, like when Dom finally locates his wife Maria. I was really thrilled throughout the entire game and enjoyed the various mission styles. Driving tanks across breaking ice, fighting  a monsterous creature in the water, killing a massive worm from the inside-out and flying around on a reaver just to name a few. All great stuff. Be sure and watch through to the end of the credits for a treat.The only real downside to GOW2 that I experienced was that several times my character became stuck in the environment, forcing me to restart a sometimes difficult part. Also, some of the video clips would get stuck and skip, but they could be skipped -- however, at the cost of missing the cut-scene. While these were minor for me, after reading some of the other reviews out there it may have been more problematic for others.Final thought:If your a fan of the original Gears of War, then its a no-brainer that you'll really enjoy this title too. If you've never played the original, but are out for a really great event driven game that packs in the action, then you need to look no further then GOW2. Personally, I think this is a must have game for any action addicts out there. With multiple levels of difficulty, it's perfect for the casual to the die-hard gamer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

The sequel just looks better overall, sporting livelier colors and a little more variety in the levels. The first one was admittedly a bit murky and monochromed but this one does away with all that.Sound is absolute mayhem, with a superb sound mix and a new music score by Steve Jablonsky of Transformers (the recent movie) fame. This is one loud game and you'll be able to tell the difference once you fire that Lancer which now sounds like it packs some punch.The story is a bit more refined, even if the voice acting kind of bites in a couple of instances. I wouldn't necessarily blame the voice acting actually, just the way some of the lines were written, they just feel flat and forced. A lot of questions are put out there that are not necessarily answered and by the end, you'll still have a bunch of questions that'll demand some kind of answers. Still, Gears of War 2 has a much better story than the first one and is definitely more involving, especially in regards to the character of Dom who has a genuinely moving moment which I wouldn't dare spoil. You also have some boss battles that are simply stunning in their execution with bosses so large you have to take them out from the inside (and yeah, I'm not telling you anymore than that). Have a friend join you to take on the Locust cooperatively and the game just gets that much better.Multiplayer is a blast as expected and before I go into that, I have to mention the controls. They've refined them to a point that the game just plays much more fluidly than its predecessor and its immediately noticeable. Being that the controls have been fine tuned, it makes playing the single player and multiplayer portions an even more rewarding experience. I felt the first one had some moments where I couldn't even take cover properly but thats been fixed. At any rate, there are some great multiplayer modes with an interesting take on capture the flag where the flag is a person you have to drag back to the scoring zone by force. And if you haven't heard by now, there's a new mode called Horde that lets you and four other friends (forgot to mention that the player capacity has been increased from eight players to ten in total in the versus modes) hold your own against fifty waves of Locust soldiers and beasts, coming at you faster and stronger with each successive wave of increasing numbers. Definitely my personal fave of the multiplayer modes.What I love about this game is that it doesn't dangle a carrot in front of you just to take it away at the last second. The first one was definitely guilty of this, showing creatures and events transpiring that you never really got to deal with or simply had to watch in a cutscene. Not here does this happen and let me tell you, I couldn't believe some of the stuff that happened in this game in terms of the level design and what not. I would love to tell you more but I couldn't for fear of ruining the overall experience. Let's just say that you will not be disappointed or better yet, I don't think you CAN be disappointed. This game delivers on all fronts and is one of the years best, period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

We have difficulty fitting our whole family into the Eye Cam's range of view.  This is also due to the fact that it's recommended to play approximately 8' from your television.

It looks like the users are 3' in front of their tv's.  Also, if you're tall like me, keep in mind the heighth of your ceiling when playing.

{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed completely","reviewText":"I just finished this game last night, and I'm still blown away.  I should have expected it, but still, the ending shocked me, and I couldn't help but nearly cry at the heavily religious themed ending.  This wasn't the only time I was filled with emotion in this game.  Scenes with the 'villain' gave me simpathy for a character who seemed to deserve none in the first game, and were often very heavy in nature.  Shion is forced to make a choice which breaks her hearts and an emotional player's as well.  This whole game is infused with emotional depth and philosophical ideas in a way no other video game can compare to, and will never fail to amaze the player at the power Xenosaga has over their hearts.This amazing story is told through cut scenes with good graphics, some lasting at least 15 minutes.  I never found myself tired of the endless cut scenes because the improved character models look great, the story is enormous, and the action scenes are greatly done.For fans of the first game, gone are the four experience types, now you get three, and one of them you rarely get.  Skill points are used to learn abilities on the new skill tree.  All characters share the same skills, but each can put the skills to use differently.  Class points are earned easily, from bosses and from mastering parts of  the skill tree.  Exp is earned from fighting battles, as usual.  Some people say that the skill tree makes all characters nearly the same, but this is far from true.  some characters have stronger ether (magic) casting ability, some have ether based attacks, strong against a few types of enemies, but horribly weak against others, some have strong physical attacks, some can only hit ground enemies, and some can knock enemies into the air and then hit them hard.  Stocking allows you to build powerful combos to utilize the new break system.  In the break system, certain move sets will 'break' the enemy, after which they will recieve slightly more damage and can be knocked to the ground or into the air.  Using the improved boost function, which now goes with the entire party, as well as enemy party, you can have your other characters attack the enemies which are in the air and deal at least twice the normal damage.  Gone are the long, annoying, repetitive animations from the first game, battles now go almost twice as fast, causing the game to be about half as short as the first.  There is no money system in this game, although you can sell items for a side quest, so all items must be found or aquired from enemies, although eventually you will get spells which will make the items mostly unimportant, and the 'psycho pocket' skill will allow you to steal usefull items from enemies.  Sadly, gone are Yasunori Mitsuda's orchestrated themes, now Yuki Kajiura is in charge of the music, which seemed to me to be so 'Phantasy Star 2' (Sega Genisis), which isn't a bad thing, I just miss the orchestra.Anyway, I think I've summed up the differences well, so if you can get by those, you will hopefully enjoy the game.  By the end of this game, even more than in the first, you will feel that you are standing in the middle of two very powerful, ancient forces, and the series is reaching the point of being an epic.  If you haven't played the first yet, there's a lot going on in this game, it will be confusing to someone who hasn't played the first.  It's a greatest hits title, so you can pick it up without emptying your wallet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2005"}

Now, working together with Rockstar Games, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneraises the bar for action games all over again.Features include a film noir love story between a cop (Max Payne) and a femme fatale murder suspect (Mona Sax). The story is a thrill ride of shocking twists and revelations. Max Payne's signature slow motion gunplay has been improved on every level. Get ready for Bullet Time 2.0, with new guns and moves that make action more intense and cinematic. The fully integrated Havok physics engine allows for interactive environments with ragdoll characters and physics in slow motion that create breathtaking combat scenes. All new AI cooperative non-player characters and more believable enemies create tension and an interesting and varied challenge. Detailed environments with stunning photorealistic textures, highly enhanced radiosity lighting, and extremely lifelike characters (including facial animations and lip synchronization) provide a visually staggering cinematic experience. Massive production values include a motion-picture stunt crew, professional talent for voice acting and graphic novels, live motion capture, and authentic digital source material from New York City.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Stylishly Honorable to the Action Platform","reviewText":"This is merely an expectation that the PS2 will undoubtedly astound gamers as the PC version has done to me.I was foreign to the world of Max Payne.  Because I was not exposed to the frenzy of the detective's game back in 2001, I felt nonchalant towards the coming sequel.  Now that I have experienced the sequel, I must profess that I have been stunned, then mesmerized, and all the more thrilled to have this game land on my laptop.  Max Payne 2: The fall of Max Payne is a barrage of devilish quality saturating all through the game and then some.  From the gutsy gameplay to the direction of the story, this game falls into a certain pizzazz of stylish coolness.I can crack the code as to why the first game ignited a stir.  An action game has never felt so empowered to be reckoned as the high  octave blast that is Max Payne 2.  Playing as a pessimistic detective, you must blaze through he dark, gritty streets of New York city.  The story alone is topnotch suspense bundled with extraordinary twists and turns that'll have you gasping throughout your day.  Driven by the story, the game's focal highlight is the gameplay's Bullet Time implementation.  Heck, Max Payne is one of those games that is truly augmented by the graphics and sheer physics of the environment.  With eye-candy in every so direction, it's a joy to shoot baddies with a multitude of weapons.  Further adding to the bountiful fun, is the Havok engine which has the environment fully interactive.  There's also rag-doll effects where spectacular combat scenes are distilled in slow-motion scenes and the best part is your in control.  The gist of Max Payne 2 is the more baddies you gun down, the faster Payne is in a slow-motioned surrounding.  With the environment flinging all over the screen and the slow motion of the game setting in, it's a delight to control this gem again and again.Payne romps through New York City at its absolute darkest.  As you go guns-a-blazing, you'll notice the graphical powerhouse.  Each nook and cranny in the game is a stellar high point.  What hit's the stride even more is the detailed photo realistic textures and the maw-gaping lighting effects.  Like the story, the graphics stand on its own.  A spectacular soundtrack kicks in to add to the already fascinating atmosphere.  There are plenty of compulsive tracks, but the best part of the audio derives from the firefights where the signature sound of Payne's heart gallops as enemy gunfire sounds distorted.  Plus, the voiceovers are good and suit the personality of Payne.  The gritty comic book scenes heavily attribute to the overall atmosphere of the astounding game.  You can easily tell that the makers of the game, have put sweat and effort into this wet-dream-come-true production.The first game has been known to be very short, and the second one follows suit.  Under the circumstances, its honest to say that fans of this game will not go out aching.  This game is really something, but does leave the gamer wanting much more.  Aside from that  quibble, the stunning action warrants a purchase.  Max Payne 2: the Fall of Max Payne is stylishly honorable to the action gaming platform.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Awakening of a New Classic","reviewText":"\"Fire Emblem\" fans have had it tough in America, and people who have wanted to get into the franchise have arguably had it tougher. After all, most of the games are printed in limited quantities, and once they run out, it's game over on anybody else who wants to legally obtain them. While it's unfortunate that Nintendo has once again botched the release of this newest entry, those who can get their hands on it are in for the time of their lives. \"Fire Emblem: Awakening\" is a game that, in all likelihood, go on to be a classic remembered for years down the line.After creating a male or female character of their choosing, players are thrown into a war between nations, complete with swordsmen, magic casters, and other familiar types of fantasy warriors. Your character has amnesia, and is taken in by a young man named Chrom and his sister Lissa, who lead a peacekeeping group known as the Shepherds. Joining them, you find yourself caught in an epic saga that spans multiple generations (a la the \"Record of Aghrest War\" series), continuing well into the lives of Chrom and Lissa's children.Without giving any spoilers, I can firmly say that, from what I have played, this is one of the single best narratives in an SRPG, distancing itself from the quirk found in titles like \"Disgaea\" or \"Luminous Arc.\" Despite moments of genuine comedy, this is a story that is meant to be taken seriously, creating a world ravaged by war, and making players care about the people caught in the middle. With memorable new characters, as well as the triumphant return of fan favorite Marth, Nintendo has released one of their rare games in which players become emotionally invested in the story, and attached to the characters housed within, no matter how minor.This narrative strength ties well into the gameplay. Before detailing the specifics of the mechanics, it's fair to warn newcomers that, unless you select the mode deactivating this, almost of all your units can die permanently. That means if you've been romantically pairing two characters, that love can be tragically cut short by one wrong move on your part. My feelings about this feature aside, it adds a whole level of depth and meaning to the game. Again, though, those who balk at that concept can turn this feature off in \"Awakening\", making it easier to pick harder difficulty levels by alleviating the stress of life management.Now, the best part about the gameplay though is that no matter what you choose, you're going to be in for a good time. This is a standard grid-based, turn-based strategy game, complete with battles that can last well over an hour, elaborate strategies, and slow realizations that your strategy had just enough flaws to get you killed. People who haven't ever played an SRPG may be able to think of it as a more elaborate version of a chess match. And much like that famous board game, you won't be blaming the opposition for your failure. This game does a great job of making players realize that it's not a matter of the AI being hard that results in a lose; it's a matter of you screwing up. With in-battle level-ups, players are forced to pick and choose which units to use and which to let fall to the wayside, trying to figure out the best one for different situations. It's deceptively simple at first, but victory hinges upon a player's innate strategic capabilities.Returning players are treated to two main features new to the series, both of which are crucial to survival. The first of these is standing two units next to each other on the board in order to gain stat boosts; this has been done in other SRPGs, sure, but it's implemented very well here. In fact, one could even say that it's essential to winning battles. The other new feature is just as important, however, which is the action of two units doubling up on the same square. One takes the lead, the other provides support, and players have to switch according to the opponent or if the other unit's health begins to run low. This provides all sorts of new possibilities. Have a lancer about to square off with an axeman, the former's weakness, but still want to level that unit up? Team up with a swordsman and provide supports. Want to level a weak unit without the constant threat of dying? Have a healer on standby.The strategic possibilities in \"Awakening\" are virtually limitless, mainly thanks to the aforementioned new abilities. In a gaming landscape where SRPGs are failing to evolve and innovate, Nintendo has proven triumphant with one of the finest strategy experiences ever crafted.Things in the audio/visual department are pretty exceptional too. Each battle plays out in an exciting cutscene in which players can control the camera, or even see the battle from the unit's first-person perspective. Cutscenes which drive the narrative forward use the same polygonal models, coupled with some really exceptional character artwork speaking through text boxes. Also utilized are beautiful cinematic cutscenes, which are fully animated and rendered using a sort of cel-shaded animation technique. These, as well as the non-cinematic cutscenes, all look great in 2D, but for one of the rare times, I actually prefer playing this game with my 3D Slider turned all the way up. This is a gorgeous game in 3D, with some seriously convincing effects; one level's snowflakes were popping out so much that I could almost feel my hands getting chilly. Much like \"Paper Mario: Sticker Star\", \"Awakening\" is a sign that developers finally seemed to have gotten the grasp of using the 3DS properly. This is paired with an orgasmic soundtrack and voice acting that is pretty solid, if not a bit minimal, to make a package that has great gameplay, great visuals, and excellent music.Nintendo has yet another notch on its belt of triple-A titles on its handheld, and it's another welcome reminder of who is firmly winning the handheld \"war.\" With SpotPass features (unit sharing? Heck yeah!) and numerous downloadable missions and character packs to come (Roy, another fan favorite, will be included), this is a game that should be in every 3DS owner's library. Actually, this game is so superbly crafted that I daresay it merits buying the system just to experience it!Tailored towards newcomers, strategy gamers, and franchise diehards alike, \"Fire Emblem: Awakening\" is an incredibly experience that is unparalleled by anything else on the market currently. Everything about it is impeccably designed, and if you're able to get a copy, then I fervently recommend you do so.Plot: 9Gameplay: 9Graphics: 9Sound: 9.5Overall: 9.25","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

Sorry to say it did not live up to expectations.  The graphics are fantastic and the \"movies\" at the beginning of each chapter help fill in some blanks in the Racoon City incidents of previous games.  My main complaint is that the player has no control over the movement of the characters.  You have to go at the game's pace even if you've already shot every zombie in sight.  That was really irritating at times.  Also, the game was relatively easy to beat on normal difficulty.  I haven't tried the hardest difficulty level yet but on RE4 even the Easy level was challenging for me the first time through.Overall, the game is fun if you enjoy shooter/horror/survival games.  It's not terribly challenging and play is pretty much one note.  You can't go off exploring other rooms or passages because you're locked into a certain path.  In my opinion, it does not live up to the RE4 standards.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

I even took my turn playing when he'd gone to bed at night or when he was at school, and I'm definitely picky about the games that I'll play. So when Super Mario Galaxy 2 came out, we immediately went out and got it, and it's important for me to point out that this is the very first game we purchased on the day that it came out.The game is great! You get all of the things that you loved from the first one, including the music and the puzzles, and you get all sorts of fun new stuff, including the new power ups (I actually love the digging one) as well as Yoshi!! It's controlled the same way that the first one was controlled, and while the majority of the levels aren't too difficult (which is in keeping with the Mario world style), there are definitely some tricky puzzles that your brain has to work on a bit to figure out.Another thing that we found is that, when you're on spaceship Mario, you can share star bits with other players who have a profile. This is actually a really great tool, especially if you have an adult playing and a child playing a separate profile, as it allows the adult to stock up the star bits so that the child can open some of the levels of the game.I'm sure that we'll wear this game out just like we wore out the first one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

In particular the story is what is highlighted here, and you get a lot of story.  However, it lacks in other elements and definitely does not deserve a five star rating.So I was a little late playing this one, I just beat it 10 minutes ago, unlocking all skills, weapons, and subquests.  All in about 105 hours.  So I guess I guess I'd consider myself a hardcore RPG guy and this was one of the few FFs (along with 2 and 3) that I haven't got to yet.  And let me say I am quite pleased with a lot that this game offers, but I still couldn't stand some aspects of the game so let me break it down by story, gameplay, animations, and extras.STORY.If the game was rated solely on the story, 5 stars easily.  While I can't say it was the best of FF, it was just an overall solid intriguing story.  It DOES start extremely slow (and you might be like WTF is this), but the story picks up/ gets better as you progress.  Even the ending satisfied me.  One thing I didn't like was that it was a little excessive.  Sometimes you could press select to see a different thing happening at the time.  Usually these things were extremely insignificant, and it happens A LOT.The characters were okay, but with their animation and choice of wardrobe, it was sometimes hard to take them seriously.  I will discuss that later, but I also kind of wish the characters were a little bit more mature.  I loved their personalities, but c'mon the princess is only 16, she's jail bait for crying out loud.  One other thing I didn't like about characters was that some of them didn't really have a major part in the story.  There could have been more to some of the characters in subquests, but not the case.GAMEPLAY.Another important aspect.  But I wasn't as fond of the gameplay.  What I didn't like was the leveling up and \"trance\".  For leveling up, it's so difficult to find good grinding spots, and it takes so long to level up.  Also, I finished the game at level 94 for Zidane and he only had about 6000 HP.Another thing is how damage is conducted.  I obtained the summon Ark from the subquest toughest boss in the game which was extremely time consuming, and after a 5 minute cinematic presentation, it only causes about 7000 damage to regular enemies. Ugh, the Knights of the Round in FFVII would be laughing.Trance was another issue.  Yea so it's like a limit break, okay, but you just barely ever get to use it.  Instead of activating trance whenever you want, it automatically happens, which sucks because the battle is usually over by the time you get it and the gauge starts over.  I didn't even get to use all the special attacks from Zidane's trance, in fact I think I only accessed it like three times.  That's a definite step back from FFVII's limit breaks or even (dare me) that of VIII.ANIMATION/DESIGN.What was square thinking with the design? This was the reason I never was drawn to playing it all those years.  The characters just looked too goofy or cartoonish.  To my expectation and dis, it WAS actually hard sometimes taking the story seriously with the cartoony animations (Zidane is a midget for crying out loud).And what is with the choice of wardrobe.  The princess wears an orange jumpsuit, Steiner wears what looks like a Halloween knight's costume, and Kuja really ticked me off by wearing some weird outfit that looks like something a hooker would wear as some type of fetish thing.  Idk.. I really wish Square made a better effort to give the characters the animations they deserved. Look at Zidane in Dissidia, he's more life-like.SUBQUESTS/EXTRAS.Subquests were okay, but I think they could have been a lot better.  This is where I spent all my time on, including leveling up to beat optional bosses.  The chocobo mini game and treasure hunt, I found to be very fun.  But unfortunately that's pretty much all I can say.  Other subquests were very hard to find, very insignificant and not really part of the main story line.  So just overall definitely okay, but at the same time, definitely lacking.BOTTOM LINE.So Final Fantasy IX to be brief is a step above FFVIII but a step below FFIX.  Don't listen to people who say it's incredible.  It's not. It's a great experience but if you're used to the greats like IV, VII, X, then you'll be pleased with this, but not blown away.  For me, I had low expectations, and was quite surprised.  So try it out, it's a little lengthier than previous FFs, but you'll probably like it, but I'm telling you it does have some faults.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2011"}

This game has soo many more options than in previous years and the Road to the Show got rid of the stupid goals that you had to accomplish that ruined the experience. Let me start by saying I though the Show 10 was a broken piece of crap personally, the AI had the worst rubberbanding I have seen since NFL Street. The Show 09 was way better IMO so if you don't want to fork over 60 Bucks get 08 or 09 because 10 will just piss you off unless going back and fourth scoring 4 runs an inning then getting grounded out the next two is somehow fun to you. Anyways I have read a lot of people complaining saying that they did not like MLB the show because it is too hard and is not much fun, this game actually has a novice mode and the sliders actually work.

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

{"product_name":"B00006Z7I3","description":"The Getawayoffers shooting and driving action in gigantic London environments, from busy streets to gritty warehouses, that are re-created in obsessive, photorealistic detail. How gigantic? One of the developers boasted that it takes 15 minutes of real time to drive from one end of the city to the other. The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"Not a Grand Theft Auto Rip-Off","reviewText":"It seems every time I mention this game to anyone the response is always the same:  \"That game just looks like a rip-off or Grand Theft Auto!\"Granted, at first glance it does look as if this borrowed too heavily from the GTA series, but if you give the Getaway a chance you'll find that it's quite it's own game.Where as Grand Theft Auto pretty much throws you into a city and lets you do what you please, the Getaway is very linear.  It follows two characters through a very good story line, and it really makes you feel liek you're playing a movie, which is obviously what the developers intended.  It seems cliche to say that a game makes you feel like you're playing a movie, but in the Getaway that is exactly what it does.First of all, there are no maps or health readouts on the screen at all.  No arrows, no ammo indicators.  Just gameplay.  There will never be any sort of icon on the screen at any time.  Which is to say that there will never be any indication aside from the controller in your hand that you are infact playing a videogame.  This can be difficult at times, which is why I took away one start from my overall score, because when you are driving a car you'll likely find that you will have absolutely no sense of where you are going.  This city is enormous, and there isn't even a map to help you get around.  When on a mission the only way you will find out which ways to turn is by paying close attention to the blinkers on your car which go off indicating when it's time to make a turn.  It gets quite frustrating because often times, I just found that I was spending most of my time playing the game looking for the location I was trying to get to.And as for the lack of a health-readout, the only way you will know when your characetr is about to die is by looking at the amount of blood on your character's clothing, and how much he is limping.  You'll know when there's too much blood.  A novel concept, and unlike the blinkers on the cars, this actually works fairly well.  And don't expect any health in the form of food or anyting lying around on tables.  When your character needs health, you will have to build it up by leaning against a wall for a while.  Again, very realistic, but not possible when you're in the middle of a gunfight, which happens to be quite often.I didn't have to much of a problem with the controls, but the driving controls do take some time getting used to.  Like GTA, you can steal any car on the road, and each one handles very differently.  But unlike GTA, this game features liscensed vehicles from manufacturers like Lexus.The gameplay outside of the cars is outstanding.  You have an unbelievbale amount of moves in the plam of your hands.  Everything from taking hostages, to jumping out from behind walls and then safely ducking back behind them can be done.  The gameplay itself varies in style, but manages to combine the best elements of games like Metal Gear Solid, Winback, Splinter Cell, Driver, and yes, Grand Theft Auto.This is a avery adult game.  There is a lot of violence, and a striking amount of blood.  The language, as you'd expect from a game similar in content to GTA, is very strong.  In fact, the language in this game is stronger than in any game that has come before it.  Nothing is censored.And finally, the graphics are outstanding.  Grand Theft Auto, which looks a lot like a cartoon, cannot hold a candle to the Getaway in terms of graphical detail.  The characters and environments (the game takes place in London) are super-realistic.Overall, this is an amazing achievment as far as the future of videogaming is concerned.  It is technically impressive, and shocking, and amazingly fun to play.  Enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2003"}

The game presents a nice challenge but only because you're faced with contorlling two characters at one time rather than the standard one.  A nice idea, that could easily work out fine.  I had no problems with this idea, since there weren't many (if any) parts where I had to take a specific character and go to a certain point.The game is nice, though as a prequel it reveals too much and makes the first RE game a joke.  In a prequel you don't usually want to get AHEAD of the sequel. RE0 does just that with the already advanced Zombies and monsters in the game, as well as the same damn boring plot we've seen since the dawn of Resident Evil on the playstation.As far as graphics go, this is by far the most stunning GCN game I've ever seen.  Everything has a reaction and the lighting effects are spectacular!As far as gameplay and horror go. There's nothing new in Resident Evil that could possibly be scary. In fact after RE2 all the horror was gone from the series and the only thing left were complex puzzles and intresting weapons.  RE0 is no exception.I don't usually mind repetetive gameplay in a series but for RE I had to make an exception. Every RE game is the same, more or less. You play as a boy or girl (both in this sense and Code Veronica).  However, RE still has some shocking plotwists. I also don't like the fact that nothing new has really happened in the world of RE. It's a nice \"Formula\" but the fact that every RE game ends in about the same fashion makes the games predictable.Also, the same bad controls are still there and your inventory space is still hard to manage.  This time you must deal with both characters having six slots.  Six slots as opposed to the normal eight really brings your item management to a new level.Also, each character has their own abilities which I hate.  For example, Rebecca can mix herbs.  Now if you try to make Billy mix herbs it just won't work! No matter how hard you try. This becomes annoying.It's about the same old same old.  There is nothing new about RE anymore and that makes the plot very predictable.  Get RE0 but then trade it.  Some secrets are around but the game isn't worth the replay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2003"}

After two failed attempts on the PlayStation that tried to incorporate free 3D movement, Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PS2 returns the series to its roots as a side scrolling shooter. The intense action moves both vertically and horizontally, but the focus firmly remains on the 2D plane even though all the characters and objects are comprised of brightly detailed polygons. Don't get too distracted by the pretty pictures since the game's seven levels are insanely difficult. Playing with two players simultaneously is slightly easier and great fun, plus unlocking all the endings and hidden levels adds replay value. A hard-driving rock soundtrack is the stand-out on the auditory front. General sound effects like explosions could use a bit more punch, however. Much like in the early 8- and 16-bit versions, survival depends on memorizing the placement and patterns of enemies. Your arsenal consists of three different guns, which you must switch between depending on the task at hand. It takes lightning-quick reflexes to react correctly, and the responsive controls won't let you down. You can use either the analog stick or digital pad for movement, but you'll want to stick with the latter to get the precision needed to stay alive. Contra: Shattered Soldier is a must-have for fans of the originals and highly recommended for anyone looking for a tough-as-nails shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2003"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"As near perfect as you can get","reviewText":"To this day, I still think Batman: Arkham Asylum has some of the best pacing found in a videogame. Others that rival it can include Uncharted 2 but for a game that wasn't likely to be a good game, imagine most people's surprise when it turns out not only was Arkham Asylum a great comic book game but a great game in its own right. So when Arkham City was announced a mere 4 months after its release, the skepticism returned. Was the first game a fluke? Would it be the case of indie darling followed up by bloated blockbuster sequel? And the large amount of villains announced meant Arkham City could potentially be a bit too....\"stuffed\". And again skepticism is unwarranted because somehow, Rocksteady made a game that I can't even find a legitimate complaint about. Unlike Mortal Kombat and its online lag and enemy AI and Deus Ex with its boss battles, nothing in this game hurts it. There's no \"well I'd like to love the game if it wasn't for...\" things in this game. Batman: Arkham City is as close to a perfect game and I still can't figure out how they did it.Taking place a little after Arkham Asylum, the former warden of the asylum, Quincy Sharp, is now mayor of Gotham City and has walled off a section and dubbed it \"Arkham City\". A place where criminals can roam about freely with no jails, schedules or guards and pretty much anything goes. Unfortunately, Bruce Wayne has also been thrown in and after escaping and donning the Batsuit, Batman must now deal with not only the regular criminals that have been thrown in but familiar faces from the rogue's gallery has he figures out what exactly is going on and what is \"Protocol 10\".Unlike the slightly-open-but-mainly-linear progression of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City is more open-world a la Assassin's Creed where Batman can go wherever he wants and it's up to the player to determine what they feel like doing. Thankfully the world is not only big but dense and packed with detail and sidequests to do so there's never any idling. In fact, one can go through the entire game and not know certain things were even in the game. From villains having their own missions to Riddle trophies and puzzles to solve and the main quest, Arkham City should take you a fair amount of time to complete and a New Game+ option certainly helps. And just like Arkham Asylum, City is a beautiful game with its gothic overtones, moody lighting and having it entirely played out in a snowy night, this game is really something from an art design standpoint.When not using gadgets and stealth at your disposal, Batman goes into one of the funnest and fluid melee systems around. While it might be easy to just \"button mash\", getting high scores and getting a higher combo multiplier requires a bit more finesse. From dealing with armed henchmen, to ones carrying riot shields and stun rods, the dynamic combat allows for a visually cool and satisfying feeling when you go a long period of time without making a mistake. While the constant camera rotating can make it a bit frustrating and mashing the counter button only to get hit anyway occasionally rears its ugly head, playing as Batman is always bad ass. The gadgets are also fun to use and old favorites like exploding gel return while some new ones such as disruptors for firearms and mines and an electric projectile gun makes for creative combat uses and nice puzzle implementation.Included with new copies (or a 10$ purchase for used owners), is Catwoman who handles a tad differently than Batman. Unfortunately her missions in the storyline are oddly brief but she's quite fun to control and her seamless animations are quite something. Other villains show up as well from a near unrecognizable Nolan North (but don't worry, he's all over this game) as the Penguin to Mr Freeze to Two-Face and some other surprises, Arkham City manages to pack a lot of secondary characters without making the game bloated. Incredibly well-voiced and managing to be worthwhile to encounter without sacrificing the thrust of the main campaign, it pays to explore the city's every corner. However, not all is rosy as some villains make some common appearances while others such as Poison Ivy might as well be cameos are not included at all considering how brief they feel.Like Arkham Asylum, this game doesn't have multiplayer per se but it brings back the combat challenges and predator challenges. In the former, it's you as either Batman, Catwoman, Robin (Best Buy preorders) or Nightwing (future DLC) as you take on a large group of enemies while you compete for high scores. It's here where the combat excels and with different gadgets to use, each character handles different enough yet Batman tends to be the easiest to use. The predator challenges are where you have to stealth your way through a map and accomplish certain goals such as silent takedowns from a ledge, up above, from below etc. They're not as fun as the combat ones but they break up the pace a bit.With promise of additional DLC and a lengthy campaign in its own right in addition to the challenge maps, Arkham City gives more than a bang for your buck and it's especially worthwhile if you're a Batman fan or just comic books in general. It lacks the out-of-the-blue surprise of Arkham Asylum but add this one to game sequels being better than the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around. Thankfully Blue Shift comes with the previous expansion Opposing Force.Blue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.The gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominos.The negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.There are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.In all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game. Chances are you can get this expansion with one of the deluxe Half Life 1 games, so save some money and get Blue Shift there instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

Noire seemed like it would be different and interesting. I thought it would be a nice break from all the typical action games out there.While this game is certainly a beautiful game to look at, it is essentially a pretty guessing game.You will interrogate people and then be given the option to believe them, doubt them, or call them liars at various points during the interrogation. You will have only vague facial expressions and mannerisms to go on. (Nope, the facial expressions are not that amazing - not at all - sorry, true believers. Plus, how amazing is it to make a character look away or act nervous?) But, even if the expressions were actually super-duper amazing, the difference between doubting someone and thinking they are lying can be pretty slim, and yes, a guess at best.But, wait, the player will also have \"clues\" to help with his/her guess. Well, the clues are often just as vague as the facial expressions. Some clues will seem good enough to think someone is lying, but are not.These issues might seem fairly small at first, until you realize that interrogation is a massive part of the game. You will learn very quickly that interrogations are also the real problem with L.A. Noire. The biggest problem is that your interrogation doesn't branch off toward different outcomes based on the accuracy of your guesses, or lack thereof. The penalty isn't a different and more difficult path to solving the crime (which might have been interesting). The penalty, if you should ever guess wrong, is that the game will kick you out to the start of the interrogation, to start it over from scratch - you will simply redo the interrogation keeping the answers you guessed right the first time, then you will choose different answers on the ones you got wrong - repeat and repeat and repeat until you get all the answers right.What a painful, lazy, and unsophisticated game.I really can't believe anyone thinks that is fun.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00886WO5W","description":"","reviewerName":"The Martyr","summary":"Stuck On Another Island","reviewText":"I would,firstly, like to say Dead Island:Riptide is not a sequel to Dead Island. DI:R is in fact more like an add-on if anything.In the original Dead Island I remember thinking to myself how much potential that game had. If the developers had gotten a few more things right, and fixed several issues, Dead Island had potential to be a great game. So, with DI:R I had thought they would do all they can to make this amazing. I was wrong;dead wrong.Dead Island: Riptide essentially feels,and looks,EXACTLY like it's predecessor. Perhaps, graphically, it has improved a bit. It has all the same problems and glitches of the previous game. I feel the developers were uninspired, and lazy at times.The combat is still more focused on melee and the guns can still feel underpowered; despite what their DPS says. The issue of zombies being OVER-POWERED is still present. It is ridiculous a walker with 2 or 3 good swings could kill my level 47 Sam B. Combat is still satisfying but can feel like a grind after a while.The game play is good. I like how you repair and upgrade weapons. Trading is pretty standard, but, once again, not much has changed.The voice acting can vary from being exceptionally good to cheesy and weak. I will say the five main characters are great. Especially Phil LaMarr, I love that guy.This game has great characters. I get attached to some of the NPC's and I get upset when they die. The main characters are the best; in my opinion. I played as Sam B in DI and now DI:R and he is my favorite. I still love Xian, Purna, and Logan to pieces. John is pretty cool too. There are moments where some of the NPC's are completely weak and their story is paper thin.I noticed they re-used some of Dead Island's sound track and sound effects...that irked me a little. However, it was all very good. I guess when you get something right the first time don't mess with it. Though Sam B's first song, WDYVB, was better.The storyline still could be cliche, but I feel it improved a little from the first. Definitely themes of betrayal and plot twists. Of course you have your quintessential conspiracy plot. The story is decent but not great. The ending is a little vague and after reflection I think that is a good thing. Hopefully it is not what it appears to be.Overall, I would give DI:R a 7 out of 10. (Amazon's rating system is a bit awkward for me, so I rounded it up.) It's a fun, solid game no doubt. If you enjoyed the first one, then there is little doubt you will enjoy this one. Some people may be disappointed and some many not understand why critics have so harshly reviewed it; everyone is different. However, it is pretty much the same game with the exception of new main quests, which are basically boring fetch quests, new zombies, you can drive a boat, it is a different island, still an how island how original, one new character, and the story, however weak, is continued. Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide have the potential. There's just so much holding them back from being great games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Leon Help!","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 happens to be one of the largest games ever developed. If you are looking to play survival horror, then RE4 is the new scream queen. RE4 breaks from convention like no other game has done to date. This is a huge leap from the traditional Resident Evil that we knew. No longer is there the Metal Gear Solid style running around a room with set camera angles. Instead we are given true 3D with a twist - a semi-first person third person integration that has never been done before. U.S. agent Leon Kennedy has been tasked to look into the abduction of the President's daughter and his investigation has led him to a mysterious location in Europe. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out what is behind the terror. RE4 boasts three huge level designs - a village, a castle and an island. Each level contains a vast network of areas that are all unique gaming environments including farms, valley camps, water works, kitchens, tunnels, cemeteries, storage areas, waterways, lakes with monsters, caves, churches, foyers, prisons, sewers, mazes, dinning halls, servant's quarters, hives, clock towers, mine entrances, furnaces, ruins, cathedrals and radiation labs. Several memorable scenes include laser grids like in the movie of the same name, a chopper shootout and a radiation lab with mutated monsters that can regenerate damaged tissue. RE4 has roughly seven hundred and fifty monsters to defeat with numerous boss guys, puzzles to solve and pieces to collect, including money that you can steal from the local village goons and spend on buying weapons and upgrades from a mystery hooded salesman that can be found near the various typewriter checkpoints. Like \"God of War\" and \"Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy\" RE4 uses mini-games (button combinations to perform unique moves at specific intervals) even during the cut sequences. It has an approximate playing time of 17 and half hours at the minimum. The way the gun is controlled makes aiming less than steady and so accuracy is hard to obtain without lots of practice. This is a good thing because it means that when a hoard of villagers are making their way towards you it is hard to get the kind of headshot placement that you need and so the blast reactions of the zombies ranges from toppling over, being blown aside, catching fire and of course, loosing their brains when you eventually get that headshot on target. It terms of headshots, RE4 redefines it. It must be seen to be believed. Also when a zombie is on the ground you can close in and perform a round the house kick that can crack open a few craniums. You can shoot down boulders from a cliff to crush bosses or blow up booby traps or a truck loaded with dynamite to take out a village lane cram packed with zombies. RE4 is quite graphically gory. Where previous entries in the series required you to actually perform hard manoeuvres like climbing ladders or jumping gaps these are instead replaced by action sequence and so make the game more fluid from start to finish and thus more enjoyable. The load times have been significantly reduced from the almost unbearable waiting periods that Resident Evil: Outbreak turned up with. It is hard though to say that Resident Evil has ever died. Capcom have always delivered. RE4 is maybe the best instalment in the whole series... if not one of best games ever made. 3D survival horror is here to stay.Pros:- Immense Game- First Class Level Designs- Headshots- Story- Multiple CharactersCons:- None","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"&#65533;Whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on&#65533;","reviewText":"I have to admit that my first reaction to `Kingdom Hearts' was \"Oh no!  Donald Duck meets Final Fantasy!!\"  And at a very basic level that is exactly what this game really is.  For those of use who actually grew up with Walt Disney's films this combination is a bit jarring at first.  Until the story engages the player and then you are trapped, doomed to play until the very last cut scene with great delight.On an idyllic island Sora, Riku, and Kairi spend most of their time playing with friends and planning to leave and discover other worlds away across the sea.  And on a world far away, Donald Duck and Goofy find that King Mickey has left and given them a final assignment - find the keyblade and its bearer.  Darkness attacks, and the two groups of characters are drawn together, for good and ill.  Sora, who is the key bearer, Donald, and Goofy start a quest to lock the hearts of the worlds safe from the encroaching dark and save their friends.Game play is a combination of the comfortable and the unique.  This is an action RPG where jumping and athletic skills play as much of a part as fighting power and problem solving.  At first this irritated me, since even my controller enhanced reflexes often fall short of what is needed for graceful game play.  But like everything else, one adjusts, and soon even I was hopping from platform to platform, walloping enemies on the fly and tripping over Goofy's size 99 feet.The game owes its settings almost entirely to the creations of Walt Disney.  Expect everything from `Snow White' to `Tarzan,' and you will still be surprised.  But it owes the style of its story to the worlds of Final Fantasy and its relatives.  This provides both the action component and a subtext of willingness to attach a spiritual message to what is really an entertainment game.  And this is genuinely well done - less obtrusive, say, than FFX, but far from the occasional vacuous moments that haunt a Disney tale.As such, `Kingdom Hearts' provides an enchantment unusual for what is really not that difficult a game.  It is big enough for a guide to be worth consulting, but the normal quest for interesting ways to power up for the big bosses will turn up enough of the side quests to keep up interest for all but the most jaded.  In retrospect, I find that I enjoyed this game far more than I expected, and now understand its lasting popularity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2003"}

CQC - Close Quarter Combat Advanced A+To think I almost gave the original MGSIII Snake Eater 1 star! \"Metal Gear Solid 1\" October 1998 designed to save the Playstation1 from the Ninento64 \"Golden Eye\" (released in September 1997) was a new type of `cinematics' game that the N64 cartridge could not do (playback of movie scenes on a disc is \"MGS1\"), MGS1 is about 4 stars at best or five if you really thought it was the bee's knees, maybe the preferred \"Golden Eye\" for 5 star treatment. Playstation2 hype, Christmas 2001 \"MGS2: Sons of Liberty\", created a big five star stomping fan base (see the reviews), but most of us could see how phoney \"MGS2\" was. I gave \"MGS2: Sons of Liberty\" 3 stars back then (maybe much less now considering), boring cinematics and constant in-game radio stops made it horribly annoying; flat game play often simply unplayable out of restriction. Quite limited in movement considering the excitement, the character of Raiden was also not Solid Snake either. The oil tanker was cool as a map for the first hour but not the whole game! In 2005 I played \"MGS3\" for thirty minutes and boxed it shaking my head. I went back to it again for another attempt last week. Let me explain. All is forgiven... and then more some.The good news is that MGS3: Subsistence is now the first fully 3D MSG game. Press R3 and it is like the camera on Resident Evil 4. Press it again and it reverts back to the fixed camera mode. You can basically see everything you want now. So wow wow wow. \"MGS3: Subsistence\" is a Solid Five star game, the best MGS experience besides not even being MGS at all at times (this is why it is better), maybe as good as the experience of playing \"Half-life 2\" till the end, I am not a MGS fan (still not; skipped `MGS2.5: Subsistence' totally) but I played this like it was the best thing since \"GTA: San Andreas\" or slice bread. The video cut-scenes are the finest on the PS2 yet (or any game for that matter; some elements are PS2 rendered; wear the zombie mask camouflage for best cut-scene effect!), \"MGS2\" had great graphics, but MGS3 is all about the all-too-very real jungle and wildlife around you (Yes PS2 graphics are nothing compared to a PC ATI 256mb pro card, but Snake Eater lives!) LISTEN NEXT - William Ewart Fairbairn, General List, was born February 28, 1885 in Rickmansworth, Herts, England. Prior to the Second World War, Fairbairn was the Chief Instructor at the Shanghai Municipal Police from October 1907 to March 1940. Fairbairn joined SOE in March 1942 with the rank of Captain, having previously been an instructor at the War Office Special Training Centre in Scotland in July of 1940. He founded CQC (see review title). CQC is employed in MGS3 as a means to effectively fight and ground the enemy with Judo type throws and holds and \"Tenchu\" style executions, use him as a human shield or interrogate the enemy for mission information (yes you heard right), you can also select several types of camouflage (play `Barbie' every other new area you explore, but still come out feeling more like a man) MGS3 has the most realistic jungle terrain accomplished in a game since \"Far Cry\", as you crawl your way very slowly through miles of Russian woodland for a few days (literally), also hunting the wildlife to feed yourself and a self-administered x-ray medical scan system that allows you to select treat various wounds with different medic tools, I came out the other side of this EPIC INSTANT CLASSIC thinking that there is a future revolution in gaming waiting to happen as a result of Solid Snake, you should support this game! Why? Solid Snake gets you doing things in the jungle that you have never done before in a `game'. At one stage I could see my own vomit on infrared because of a bad animal I killed and ate. This hot zone gave me away to a sniper called `The End' who eradicated me because of it. Towards the end of the game things get more urban. I hope MGS4 is in Tokyo City but just like the jungle here! I find the following most logical. You must find your own way but - see map, camouflage gear (check halfway through map again), first-person quick look, infrared look, sonar ping, crawl, kill rat food, ping again, crawl slowly to bad guy, CQC grab (Choose CQC mode), interrogate, kill, CQC ground smash three other enemies there and then, hide in bushes, set TNT, crawl away, detonate if bad guys come, eat hunted food, try CQC three more enemy, accidentally fail with CQC on one who alerts six other enemy, take them out with up to twenty weapons of various types or CQC them all, blend into the jungle and run away, the choice is yours until you get to the other end of the map where a video will play and although the story is ten times better than MGS2, it is still Japanese, so these things will always remain illogical to us Westerners, still works better than most PS2 attempts, at times Manga quality, this is one of the most memorable games I have played in my lifetime. Also now that most of the PS2 stealth games have come and gone the jury is in. MGSIII simply owned them all hands down. Now with the new 3D mode it is worth playing it all over again.Use your sonar, map and equipment and play the game SLOWLY (not GTA madness!) as in crawl for miles and miles in the right frame of mind and you will appreciate how significant things really are. Subsistence also includes MULTIPLAYER and will 0WN YOUR BROADBAND! Given the factNew Features:- Fully 3D by pushing the R3 button.- Demo Theater, Extreme difficulty level, Duel Mode and more Snake vs. Monkey missions.- More Camouflage and face paints.- Cutscenes theater parody.- Plus some other extras.Pros:- The first true stealth game you will ever play.- Likely the last true stealth game you will play until the PS3.- CQC.- Russian JungleCons:- HIGHEST PS2 LEARNING CURVE.

Final Fantasy 8 (and, oddly enough, FF 10) are wonderful examples of how to bore people silly while forcing them to sit through some nice-looking battles.For those gamers who, like me, need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the game's plot, let me say this: Squall is a moody, horrible, angst-ridden Phallocrat. His supporting cast are forgettable, with the exceptions of the consummately annoying Zell Dincht and the ridiculously feeble Rinoa Heartilly. The characters in FF 8 have none of the appeal of Cloud et al from FF 7, or Zidane and the lovable half-breeds from FF 9.For gamers who don't consider this to be so important, FF 8 still manages to nicely ruin the Final Fantasy reputation by being one of the most boring and unrewarding games in the series. Battles are innumerable and completely random, and fall into 2 categories: extremely easy and unfairly difficult. Case in point; you face Seifer's two main flunkies early on in the game, by which stage your levels are too high to build up quickly on the feeble monsters available in the college &amp; the surrounding areas, and too low to beat these henchmen without massive amounts of luck. The result? You end up running about doing frustrating battle with low-level wildebeests for hours, and the game becomes very, very boring.The graphics are shamefully poorly-thought out. The pre-rendered backdrops for some of the major levels (Balamb Garden, Edea's House) are bland, and have none of the charm of the cityscapes of FF 7 or the magical countryside vistas of FF 9. The character models are far too complex, and look pixellated and rough at almost all angles. Polygon pop-up didn't die out with the Sega Saturn; it's alive and well and working for Squaresoft. The pre-renders, however, are amazing, approaching the quality of early PS 2 titles in their scale and realism.The sound is run-of-the-mill poor PlayStation fare, but the music is decent enough. Better, too, is the Magic system, where, instead of spending hours confusing yourself with Materia, you now Junction Elementals and spells. Sadly, the game relies less on Magic and more on difficult Limit Break techniques and expensive items, so this really isn't a huge plus until late in the game.All in all, FF 8 is a VERY disappointing game, lacking the freedom of exploration of FF 7 and 9. It's a game on wheels, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but when the plot and characters are so forgettable, it becomes a major problem. Steer clear.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2003"}

Good news first, one thing I like about it is the super light weight...by far the lightest controller I've ever owned.  It also is now wireless.  You can also turn on and off the console with the \"PS\" button in the middle.  One of the best features is the new SIXAXIS motion feature.  It makes game playing interesting.  For example, you can literally steer your motor vehicle by moving the pad left, right, up or down in the game Motorstorm (demo).  We'll see how developers will use this feature in future games...but so far so good!There are drawbacks to the controller.  For one, there is a usb cord that comes with the system and controller...what's disappointing is that the usb cord is so short maybe about only 5 feet long.  I'm not sure if they include they usb cord if you buy the pad individually.  However, I guess Sony expects gamers to sit right up to the tv when playing or charging the controller because of the short cord.  I had to add an extension since I am about 10 feet away.  But you won't use the cord so much because it charges pretty quick and battery lasts a long time before it needs charging...maybe up to 30 hours?Another negative is that the L2 and R2 buttons feel awkward.  Sony tried to make this into \"triggers\" but still keeping it's controller pad form, causes strains with some games.  For example playing Need for Speed Carbon and holding the R2 trigger all the time, your fingers will slip when it gets moist.  The least Sony could of done was make the buttons more rubbery for more grip or design the trigger so your fingers won't be slipping off the button.Other than that, the controller is pretty simple and with the motion sensor makes it different from the past ones.  I would of still preferred the \"boomerang\" type controller they had in mind, but the SIXAXIS isn't too bad of a deal....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2006"}

One of my favorite moments during this game is when my pistols would zoom in on a target I was aiming at, go slo-mo, and then literally watch my bullet guide itself to my target resulting in cool headshots in which my enemy would scream in agony before dying. The gunplay is excellent and easily makes you forget Midway's critically ashamed Hour of Victory's terrible gameplay. Other cool moves include diving over tables and other objects while going slo-mo blasting your enemies. You also get other upgrades to your abilities which makes the action all the more lucious. However there are certain things that prevent this game from being perfect. The missions at times feel generic(destroy a certain number of drug labs or boats) and the diving mechanic can be unwanted because the game does it for you when your moving to the side and you accidently touch a table.

There are two of you, you're an army, you shoot lots and lots of people.  If that's enough for you, why read further?  That's what it is, that's what you get, and that was plenty for me... for a little while, at least.It's hard to talk about AoT and not compare it unfavorably to Gears of War, but I'll do my best.  They share alot of common ground and in those areas, Gears comes out ahead each and everytime.  We do, however, have a number of uinque goings-on here that make Salem and Rios stand alone.  The character design, down to the masks and armor, is totally awesome (if fantastical and a little silly).  The look is unique and incredibly effective, especially in some of the more ambitious cutscenes (those eyes are SPOOKY!).  The concept of 'Aggro' (god, that's a stupid word...) isn't exactly new: drawing attention to yourself by doing lots of damage/making lots of noise is a mainstay of massive multiplayer games and it's what makes a tank a tank. But this may be the first time that i've played a game that makes it a core gameplay gimic -- it's reasonably effective and adds a level of strategy to what would be a general and straight-forward shooter otherwise.  I'm not saying games like Gears of War DON'T bring 'aggro' into consideration, but AoT gives you direct control over how much attention you draw to yourself -- it's pretty interesting, especially when playing co-op, where you can really make the most of it, inching forward and gaining ground by drawing fire and biding time.  Rios and Salem are suprisingly fragile and getting to know when and how to draw the bots' attention is the only way to really survive at the harder difficulty levels.The story is serviceable: our heros are guns for hire and travel to various war zones in the past, present and near future.  They exist in an alternate reality where private military corporations (PMC's) are so widespread and effective that they may just replace standing federal armies. There's an attempt at being savvy and relevant, which I appreciate.  But it's entirely undercut by our meathead protagonists (who love Wu-Tang and football and find time to talk about it) and their near invulnerability on the battlefield.  The campy (read: awkward) voice acting and silly dialogue take settings and plot threads from oscar calliber films and turn them into Saturday morning cartoons.  Which is not a bad thing: I know I scream a lot about quality and honesty and blah blah who cares, but sometimes I just want to watch cartoons like everyone else.  There's a certain charm to Rios & Salem's simplicity and their friendship is, actually, quite endearing.  It's very remeniscent of, say, the old Batman & Robin TV show (I'll let you decide who's Adam West and who's Burt Ward when you and your buddy play through).  There's a a free-flowing sort of levity and ease to everything (despite being in Afghanistan and Iraq): Salem and Rios are at home on the battlefield, they're the star quarterbacks of the warzone and they love it.  The end result is a game that feels a bit like \"White No-Necks Shoot Ethnic Stereotypes: The Game!\".  It's old school and a little dated, but it's simple and can be low impact, low investment fun.In the end, though, the storylines are incredibly culturally insensitive (you literally shoot Iraqi suicide bombers until they explode. Awkward) and the gameplay is under-realized.  Level designs are blocky and repetitive.  Enemy AI varies from stone dumb to omnipotent.  There's a few hours of simple, explode-y fun to have but, ultimately, it's an uneven game that can't stand up toe-to-to with it's contemporaries.Still, might be a good alternative to the Gears franchise if you feel that one to be overrated and pretentious (something I hear a lot these days)...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

As of this writing, I have completed Dead Rising in the 72 hour mode and am now replaying the game to try to earn all of the achievements.Dead Rising is a brand-new genre for the Xbox 360. It's closest cousin is Condemned, a first person horror adventure game but Dead Rising has a number of unique features that set it apart. First off, you can pick up just about anything in the area and use it as a weapon. Potted plants, lawnmowers and even an electric guitar are all at your disposal. There are easily hundreds of potential weapons in this game and part of the fun is discovering new ways to fight off zombies with what you have available at hand.Adding to the distinct style of Dead Rising is the ability to customize your character. As you make your way through the mall, you can try on new clothing available from the various shops. Cool suits, fashionable glasses and, yes, even women's and children's apparel is fair game to put on. Besides wearing it as you battle the zombies, your character will also appear as you have dressed him during the video cut-scenes, which is a nice extra touch I was delighted to see. Food has also been given special \"abilities\" in the game. For example, you might find a frozen or raw food somewhere in the mall. If you eat it, you earn one or two points of health. But pop it into an oven before you eat it, and it will completely fill your health meter. Likewise, you can mix certain fluids in a blender can make an extra powerful energy drink!If you can't tell by everything I've already mentioned, this game is deep. I've only touched the surface to avoid revealing any spoilers, but trust me when I say you can get totally wrapped up in this game. The plot, the game and every little thing (be sure to check out the bookstore!) in the vast mall has been developed with so much detail that you'll find yourself enthralled by it.However, when undertaking such an ambitious project, there have to be some downfalls. The absolutely worst is the save game methodology. The developers have decided that you must find a restroom or a couch to save. While this seemed cute and clever at first, it quickly became frustrating and enraging (when you couldn't find one right before you got forced into a boss fight). Every player on the planet will find this feature problematic, I guarantee.One thing that other reviewers haven't mentioned is that some of the level bosses (called \"Psychopaths\") are redundant or unfairly matched. For example, often you'll be faced with enemies with devastating long-range weapons when all you have is a knife or 2x4 to try and knock out your opponent with. In another boss attack, I literally started at a save point and had to go through two full levels to face a boss who would inevitably defeat me and then I'd have to start all over again. These opponents often have a move that will completely incapacitate you in a single swipe, even when you have full health. This, combined with the fact that you will often have to run halfway across the map (where your last game save was) to repeat the battle, makes the game incredibly annoying. If you could ammo up, then save right before the boss battle, the game would be considerably more enjoyable.Another item, although mentioned by others in a different light, is the text-based mission objectives. Many reviewers have stated that the text is almost unreadable on smaller, standard definition televisions. However, my biggest complaint in this area is that the text is used at all. This game, by its very nature, is immersive. When you're trapped in a mall and having to fight zillions of zombies, you shouldn't have to stop to read the text of another character. I honestly wish Capcom had spent a little extra time and money to change all of the text interactions to spoken instructions. Not only would this have solved their biggest technical problem with the game, it would have also helped keep the suspense.Finally, there's a lot of \"load-screen-itis\" in this game. And by that, I mean that you'll be seeing a lot of the loading screen. Granted, the mall is a huge environment, and the load times are a snappy 5-6 seconds, but it gets annoying when you walk into an elevator and wait, walk down a hallway and wait, turn left and wait... You get the picture.There is no online component to allow multiplayer (which would be awesome!) but Dead Rising does have downloadable content from Xbox Live. It was available just days after the game released and consists of eight \"keys\" which unlock several new outfits for the main character, available at no charge. As you'd expect, the game also supports Xbox Achievements, with 50 of them to earn, each worth 20 Gamerscore points. You'll have to spend hundreds (if not thousands!) of hours in this game trying to obtain all of these objectives and I don't consider many of them a \"walk in the park.\"Honestly, it seems like I'm spending a lot of time picking on the problems of this game, but they will plague you as you try to play through the levels. But when it comes right down to it, this game has all 5 \"Es\" that make it a powerhouse: Exciting plot, Engaging environments, Enlightening characters, 360 Exclusivity and Encredible customization! (OK, that last one wasn't an \"E\" but you'll have to forgive me, just like you'll have to forgive certain flaws in this game!) In short, you should definitely pick this game up, but love it for everything it accomplishes while forgiving it for the technical problems that it has. I give it a solid 5 stars for fun, but a 3 star rating for the inherent problems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Overrated?  I no longer think so!","reviewText":"Final Fantasy 6, a.k.a. Final Fantasy 3 on the SNES, was a great success.  Many magazines like GamePro and EGM have praised it for its rich plot and complex scenarios.  Nintendo Power even called it \"the RPG hit of the decade.\"  Fans of the Super Nintendo and RPGs rejoiced over how great this game was, and with a slew of other RPGs on the system like Chrono Trigger, ActRaiser, and Nintendo's A Link to the Past, a lot of fans---myself included---generally regard this period as one of the best video game production times of our generation, if not THE best.Along comes the Sony PlayStation.  For some, this marks the end of the Golden Age of classic video games.  I don't entirely agree, as that system was the home of a handful classics; Castlevania: Symphony of the Night revitalized the Castlevania series and outranked many of the 3-D games that cropped up at the time.  Metal Gear Solid redefined stealth action and brought Solid Snake into the mainstream.  Mega Man X4 continued the saga of Mega Man X and combined the old-school flavor of Mega Man with arcade-style, frenetic action.Now, we get into Final Fantasy 7.  The first game, besides the original, to be correctly numbered.  If you've read my FF6 review, I said that that game was the end of the magic era and the introduction of industrial technology.  FF7 takes that further into a dystopian technological atmosphere; its bleak, dark outlook is not dissimilar to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.  This was a stark contrast to the previous games that were about grandiose medieval adventure.  No more dragons, colorful highlands, and sorcery.  No more saving the princess from mortal doom.  No more four crystals and light warriors.When I first played this game back in 1997, my first thought was \"This isn't Final Fantasy!  I mean, they curse in the game, too!  How dare they change my Final Fantasy?!  How dare they take away what I loved about it?!\"  Yet, many of my friends loved it, and still love it for its nostalgic factor.  Heck, it's sold over ten million copies worldwide, making it the highest-selling Final Fantasy of ALL time.Coming from that stubborn mold, I didn't give the game an objective eye and realized years later that I initally rejected it under a false pretense.  Is it my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time?  Well, no, but I am giving it its credit now, and there are many aspects of the game that help make it the top-selling Final Fantasy game.The story centers on a former SOLDIER named Cloud Strife, who joins the AVALANCHE group in trying to take down Shinra, Inc., a megolomaniacal corporation that's draining the planet's life force.  He's a bit less colorful than some of the main characters of past Final Fantasies (even further games), but through the course of the game, he has a very interesting backstory.  He is joined by Barrett, the leader of AVALANCHE and the closest video game character akin to Mr. T; Tifa Lockhart, a sexy martial artist and friend of Cloud's; Aeris, a flower merchant who turns out to be a \"Cetra,\" the previous owners of the planet; Red XIII, a cat creature that was experimented on by Shinra; Cid Highwind, a pilot with Dragoon Knight characteristics (and ironically, shares the same last name as Kain from Final Fantasy 4!  What delight!); Vincent, an immortal that previously worked with Shinra before his \"death\"...and Yuffie, a young thief who plays tricks on the party.  Oh, and then there's Cait Sith, but let's move on...The villain that everyone talks about from this game is Sephiroth.  In my FF6 review, I thought Kefka was the best Final Fantasy villain ever.  I still believe that, but Sephiroth is still one of the greatest villains in any RPG.  Sephiroth does have some interesting motives; he is originally Cloud's friend, even a mentor, and the best member of SOLDIER for a time.  However, upon learning what appeared to be his real past (not quite real, but no spoilers here!), he progressively goes insane and is hell bent on bringing back the \"Promised Land,\" which basically means wounding the planet and sucking its life force.  While he's not your typical, heartless villain (not saying Kefka is typical, but you feel from the first hour of that game that he is downright evil.), he is a mentally distraught, horribly twisted person, and that progression of madness that worsens throughout the game is actually very well transitioned.  Plus, he is responsible for murdering Aeris, scarring the mind of my RPG generation forever.While the battle system only allows three people, the Materia system and the Limit Breaks add fun to the game.  While I adore Final Fantasy 9, 7's Limit Breaks worked better, and they also level up.  The Materia system is based on your weapons and items' slots, allowing you to interchange materia like ice, fire, lightning, restore, and other things.  They also do things differently depending on how they're linked to other materia and ALSO if they're attached to your weapon or your accessory.  This adds some fun to the battle, and you can even interchange materia without disrupting the level of the particular materia slot you're using.The story is as epic as any great Final Fantasy should be, although I do admit that the ending is a bit lax...still, it was followed up by sequels, so at least the story did continue.  Most of the characters are interesting, even colorful (Cid and Barrett's constant swearing definitely added flavor to this FF entry!).  Cloud's complex relationships with Aeris and Tifa are among the story's highlights, and of course, the culmination of Cloud facing his former friend and idol.The music is once again composed by Nobou Uematsu, and he delivers once again.  My ONLY complaint is not with his compositions itself, but with the sound quality.  The Sony PlayStation had a superior sound chip system in comparison to the Super NES, yet the sound quality of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 (er, 6!) blasted you with superb sound quality.  I don't hold this against the game to any large degree, but I did find that kind of odd...especially if you hear Michiru Yamane's score for Symphony of the Night or Toshihiko Horiyama's score for Mega Man X4.Overall, my final opinion of the game.  I've grown to like this game despite my love for the more medieval-styled Final Fantasies of the past.  This one was a departure from the past, adding more mature elements into the game (colorful language, sexual references, etc. etc.).  Definitely your big brother's kind of RPG.  While some may dispute its \"overrated\" longevity, its success on the Sony PlayStation became a part of that system's legacy and it also brought RPGs to the mainstream audience.Yes, it's insanely popular, but give the game its due.  It's worthy of the qualities that have made it the best-selling Final Fantasy, and while it may not be my personal favorite, it kicks major amounts of awesome nonetheless.Other Recommendations:Final Fantasy 6 (in my opinion, perfectly accompanies this game)Chrono Trigger (SNES)Breath of Fires 2 and 3 (SNES,PSX)Xenogears (PSX)Castlevania Symphony of the Night (PSX)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

The \"Force Speed\" power lets you temporarily slow down the rest of the world (ala \"Max Payne\").  \"Force Push\" knocks a group of baddies onto their rumps so that you can rush in and take care of them before they get back on their feet.  You can also push them off of high ledges into deep, gaping holes of death (lots of those in this game).  \"Force Pull\" pulls their weapons out of their hands.  If you want, you can pull the weapons from everyone's hand and then throw your light saber like a boomerang and cut them down.  It's such a blast cutting Stormtroopers and Imperials to pieces with your immense Jedi powers.  It never gets old.There are a ton of good puzzles in this game.  This game has more good puzzles than most \"puzzle games\".  I was very pleasantly surprised by this.  Lots of them are fairly easy, but there are some very tough ones in there as well.  You really have to exercise your brain to get through this game.  I had to use a walkthrough posted on the internet several times.  There are a lot of secret areas in the game as well and a lot of little buttons and stuff to push.  If you are someone who likes to go exploring around big 3-D maps, then you will enjoy exploring the Jedi Outcast world.I must say, though, I didn't like the controls for this game very much.  Kyle can't jump and pull himself up onto a surface (ala \"Thief\"), and he skids to a stop like his shoes are covered in grease.  This makes the numerous \"jump puzzles\" in the game annoying.  I found myself overrunning doors and computer consoles a lot of the time too, and taking a couple of seconds to properly position myself to get through a doorway.  The light saber controls weren't very good either, especially when it comes to dueling.  The light saber duels aren't what they are hyped up to be.  They look and sound cool, they flash by at lightning speed, and it's next to impossible to tell what is going on.  The enemy has no health meter, and Kyle (your protagonist) doesn't auto-face the enemy.  The opponent usually flies and jumps around like Yoda in \"Attack of the Clones\".  It's very hard to tell what you are doing right, and what you are doing wrong.  I never used the special light saber moves in the game.  Instead, I found that the best way to win light saber battles was to use \"force speed\" and furiously click the \"Attack\" button.  There are improvements to be made here.The biggest downer in this game is the insane difficulty level.  And I mean INSANE, even on the second easiest setting.  I rarely played this game for more than five minutes without dying and having to reload my saved game.  The game lacks flow because of it.  There are snipers in this game that hit you from half a mile away if you pop your head out for only half a second.  There are lot of areas in the game where you have to complete 8 nearly impossible tasks in a row within 10 seconds, or you die.  I used the cheats to get past one of these after trying about 25 times.  This is the first game that I have ever cheated to finish a game.  I died about 15 times before finally vanquishing one big boss with a light saber.  I don't think that a game should be a piece of cake, but on a lower difficulty setting, you shouldn't be wearing out the \"quick save\" and \"quick reload\" keys on your computer either.  Some people might like it that way.  It just depends upon your personal preference.The good parts of this game override the shortcomings by a long shot.  Go out there and buy it, and wait like me for the next sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2002"}

Discover simple touch screen controls as well as strategic depth with different tennis swings, both which propel the tennis experience into an ever-intensifying crescendo of fun as the volleys go on.","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Bringing tennis to the masses","reviewText":"I've had an itch for a new Mario Tennis game for a few years and now that l own a 3DS l decided to give Mario Tennis Open a try. Open is the first new original Mario Tennis game since Power Tennis for the Gamecube. The Wii was basically just a port of The Gamecube game with the novelty of playing with Wii controls, which made it fun but it wasn't a new Mario Tennis game. Now comes a new Tennis game with original content with Mario and co, only this time on the go.Graphically, it looks very nice with that trademark bright and crisp graphic you would expect from a Mario and Nintendo game. The courts and environments looks stunning and inviting. It's easy to just pop it in play and feel comfortable with the controls right away. There are singles and doubles tournament. There are eight tournaments total. The extra mini-games are also fun, playing the original Super Mario Bros controlling with the balls you hit against the screen is pretty neat l must say. Galaxy rally is different and fun also. There's ring shots and paints as well which will all seem familiar if you've played the special games the N64 and GC.As far as the gameplay goes movement is very nice thanks to the joystick. The rest is fairly straightforward in that you hit A,B,X,Y to do different types of hits. There are 3 different menus on the touch screen to select different ball hits which is nice but personally lprefer using the buttons. One goo thing about the menus is it'll flash to indicate which shot would be the best in any case. The 3D is very nice, in some stages like bowser's castle the subtle flames flying in the background provide a great effect. There are two views options. The first is the traditional 3rd person point of view where you see your character. The second is a first person view that l'm not particularly fond of as l tend to miss the ball often with it.There are no items or special moves in Open, it's more of a throwback to the more tennis based game that earlier titles used to be on the Gameboy Colour and Nintendo 64. There are landing spaces called chance shots if there is a bad rebound. If you hit the ball it'll have effects such as having a banana curve, or the fireball space where the ball becomes basically unstoppable or a fast shot on a star sign. They are certainly helpful in a match but even these can be stopped so it's not as unfair as the special moves were in Power Tennis. I think the items added for unpredictability in that game though and were fun and would have been right at home on the 3DS.As for replayability, you'll want to beat tournaments with multiple characters so you can unlock the items in the store. I'll say this, the game has a LOT of unlockables for a Mario Tennis game. Not just characters but shirts, shorts, shoes, wristbands and tennis rackets and there's plenty of each. It's cool because you can equip these on your mii (yes mii is playable!) which gives the game a bit of a unique feel. Of course the more you play the more you will unlock for purchase.It would have been cool to have the tennis academy like there used to be on the Gameboy but that's only a personal wish list. Stats would have been another great addition but then again these games are more about mindless fun than controlled and serious tactical games. That's not to say the game doesn't use strategy on the contrary.All in all, if you've been craving for a new all original Mario Tennis game, this 3DS title is a worthy title. With the tournaments and other modes and unlockables is a very entertaining game. Wether you like Tennis or Mario games or both, you can't go wrong with Mario Tennis  Open. It's not a really long game but then again none of the Mario Tennis games really were. It's a just a fun game that you can pick up and play a few tournaments or exhibitions and enjoy freely wether you're a seasoned fan or a newcomer. A good return to portable console and a fine addition to the Mario Tennis franchise. 4/5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

I've played only three SEGA RPGs, and of the three, two of them are perhaps my most hated RPGs of all time: Game Arts' Lunar:SSS and Grandia. (The third was Panzer Dragoon Saga, which I absolutely LOVED.) I couldn't stand Lunar and Grandia because of their over-blown humor and mindless cheerfulness. Yech. Well, the more I read about Skies Of Arcadia, the more it sounded like those Game Arts games. I had no plans to buy it. But more and more I kept hearing friends who shared my tastes saying that they'd played SoA and that it was a stunningly great game. So I decided to give it a shot. I must admit, for the first few hours of the game, my fears seemed to be confirmed: not much conflict, not much drama, just a lot of cheerily romping around the world. But slowly the characters started to win me over. They don't have miles of depth, but they are irresistably likeable. The story took off and kept a perfect pace until the very end of the game. If there's anything this game does better than recent Final Fantasy games, it's the impeccable dungeon design, and the joy of exploration it gives you.If the characters were just a little deeper and the plot was more original (it was quite predictable), I'd easily give Skies Of Arcadia 5 stars. As it is, it's still one of the best RPGs on the market today and I'd say it's easily a must-play for even the most casual RPG fan.By the way, I understand that a sequel is underway as I type this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2001"}

Graphics are pretty good for a remake, the only thing giving it away is the low poly count of the main characters.- FMV have translated very well and are full screen.- Even after all these years, these 3 games still are the best in the series. Challenging and difficult, although you can adjust difficulty in the 2 newer ones.- There is a 5-7 minute hard drive install required, but afterwards, the games run smooth with minimal, unintrusive loading times.The bad:- Bugs, bugs, bugs. When you select a New Game in Sands of Time, the loading screen showed 2 gears moving, implying the game is being loaded. In reality, the game locked my PS3. After 3 reboots, it worked fine and the loading was immediate. The second bug also happened in Sands of Time, after the first save. You have to wall run a couple of times and the game crashed again. Two reboots later, it worked. None of these bugs were in the original. My PS3 is the newer 160 GB, updated to latest OS. Warrior Within and Two Thrones had no crashes to this point - I am about half way through both.- Sound: Difficult to control the sound. The reload screen has very loud music, while in game sounds are a lot softer. Worst is Warrior Within, the best is Two Thrones.- Sands of Time fights: Always hated the teleporting enemies, hate them as much now.Overall - this is a great value and a much welcome remake. You get 30 hours of content for a very good price.

BloodRayne. Now, now, hear me out before you bite my head off. The software is riddled with a great deal of glitches; at least as far as the Xbox version goes, that's the one I bought. There are countless times I've run into slowdown, and visible rendering, aliasing, artifacting and numerous other problems of an unpolished game. So I'm not happy with the graphics. Secondly; the control options. I have been one of those voices proudly protesting the Resident Evil/Tomb Raider and the Mouse and Keyboard control set up. When I put the disk into my Xbox I was appalled to discover the game's default setting was mouse and keyboard, which does not work on a console. Thankfully, after tampering with the control settings for a while I discovered a tomb Raider like control set up. While I hate both styles and prefer free roaming analogue (a kin to the Soul Reavor series, Mario, Zelda, and Metal Gear) the option to play this more like Blood Omen 2 than Grand Theft Auto III was greatly appreciated, but it would have been better to deign this game from the ground up like a true console game, and not one that looks, and plays like a bad PC Port.The voice acting is horrid, that said I'm now going to comment on what this game does right. The action, despite its awkward controls, is fast and furious, and there's lots of it. The story line is also darn near R-Rated Vampire flick quality, at least on par with the recent Blade movies, sadly nowhere near the caliber of something like &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, and no where near as deep as the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, or the two Soul Reavor games. As a vampire fan I rush to just about anything vampire related, and while I don't regret buying this mediocre game I'm glad I didn't pay more for it than I did (I got it second hand.) I recommend that players rent this title before committing to a purchase. The game is a far cry from a must have.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2003"}

McKenzie","summary":"A Metal Gear Game...Need I Say More?","reviewText":"I can't please everybody with one review, so I'm gonna give you two:Never Played The Original PS-one Title?---\"This is the game that created stealth gaming as we know it.  The emphasis is on avoiding the enemies to reach your objectives, though enemy contact is sometimes unavoidable and will result in some bloody gunfights.  There are creative boss battles, each vastly different from each other.  Simply put, this game never runs out of ideas to keep the experience fresh.  Like the great \"God of War\" or \"Zelda\" titles, it's an epic game, but not so big that it's overwhelming - it's got just the perfect balance of familiarity and discovery.  The basic story is that six terrorists have taken over a nuclear weapons base in Alaska, and a retired covert operative named Solid Snake is sent to stop the crisis.  Make no mistake, this plot is one hell of a labyrinth.  This story goes from double crosses and political intrigue, to figurative subjects like the nature of love and the ethics of genetic research.  Also, even though this is the third game in the 'Metal Gear' franchise, the game includes summaries of the first two 'Metal Gear' games.  However, I hadn't played those, and found this game just as easy to follow.  You will be doing more watching than playing, but both are experiences like no other.

The levels design hasn't changed at all, although the graphics are much prettier.  The written dialogue is pretty much the same, however the new voice-acting make it feel less forced.  The cutscenes are the biggest change, as fight choreography and cinematography are given a breath-taking facelift.  As many have said, the story from the first MGS merges with the gameplay of MGS 2: Sons of Liberty.  Unfortunately, this makes the game much easier to beat, which is the only reason I'm giving this game an overall 4-Star rating.  But that's a small price to pay, because this is a proper tribute to the PS-one classic's gripping story and innovative gameplay.

The world, storytelling and characters were great but I felt the combat and sidequests were really clunky and until near the end, it had a problem with pacing. But like what Ubisoft did with Assassin's Creed 2, they took all the complaints and suggestions from fans and tried to make something that was better than what came before it and so we come down to Mass Effect 2. With promises of a darker storyline and improved gameplay, did they deliver? Boy did they ever since a couple things sour the experience but not enough to completely drag the game down. Even though it's early in the year, I don't think anyone will forget the game come Game of the Year 2010 time, whether or not it wins given the onslaught of sure-to-be great games this year remains to be seen.Story: After the threat involving Saren and Sovereign has been taken care of, the Council and Alliance are not entirely sure that the Reaper threat is still an impending factor and only Shepard, his crew and Captain Anderson seem to believe it's going to happen sometime soon. Also believing the Reaper threat is still tangible is the Illusive Man and his pro-human group Cerberus and he believes this threat is tied into human colonies literally disappearing without a trace and it's up to Shepard, old friends and new allies to take care of this threat however this mission is so dangerous that everyone, including you, might not make it back.Graphics: Many people criticized the graphics in Mass Effect for having less-than-smooth framerates, textures that loaded in eventually (and it does have that weird Unreal Engine flaw that certain textures, especially on faces, seem to \"shimmer\" which is in this game as well) but the game had great art design but now Mass Effect 2 has been re-tooled and everything about it is more fluid, the graphics and especially facial animation is spot-on, the art design is as beautiful as ever and the combat has a lot more going on without a hitch in framerate. I did notice a couple of bugs though such as teammates taking cover...2 feet off the ground while an enemy NPC was literally standing in mid-air but they weren't that common and considering just the size and the amount of stuff in the game, it makes sense a couple of little technical hitches slipped by.Sound/Music: The games of Bioware, whether or not you liked the gameplay, always have stellar voice acting and here it's no exception (though the male Shepard is slightly flat) but everyone does a great job and Liz Sroka as Tali is still as cute and awkward as ever, even moreso since she's a love interest possibility. The only disappointment is Zaaed, the DLC character since he's got a cool voice but as a character he's really flat and he doesn't really do anything as far as dialogue afterwards. The music is big, operatic, has tinges of electronica/trance music since you can visit a couple nightclubs and there's some eerie, dissonant music as well so I'd recommend tracking down the soundtrack or however you like to get your OST fix.Gameplay: To bring up Assassin's Creed 2 again, the changes and refinements Ubisoft made almost make it difficult to return to the original since whatever was fixed is not there anymore and you find yourself going \"oh right, I can't do that in this one\". From selecting your biotic powers and tech abilities to cover mechanics, Bioware really refined the game and anything you can nearly think of as far as complaints have been taken into account. The sidequests involving the Mako? So far (DLC in future apparently) they're gone replaced by quests where you find artifacts or rid bases of enemy factions. Playing as an adept, it was incredibly fun to direct a squad member to a specific location, have them use Pull to act as a \"come here!\" in my best Scorpion voice then use Warp to send them flying right off the screen all in real-time without pausing the menus is quite awesome and there's literally some enemy encounters that are actually quite intense.And really the word of the day in regards to Mass Effect 2 is \"streamlined\" and in addition to the combat, the way you handle your characters as well have been refined. Inventory management? Gone. If you find a better assault rifle, everybody can use that assault rifle, which comes in handy if you have the pre-order/collector bonuses. Armor upgrades apply to every character though they're not customizable so aside from a character costume change you can do provided you complete their loyalty missions, anything you upgrade will apply to everybody and skills have also been simplified. Remember how in the first game you had to put in a certain amount of points to be better at a certain gun or unlock a better skill? Not here, here everybody has only their tech/biotic abilities and your skill points go in improving them with up to 4 upgrades, the 4th allowing you to choose the type of skill it becomes (example: one upgrade might make you a tougher character whereas the other makes your weapons dish bigger damage). But as far as gameplay is concerned, there's not a lot to nitpick.That is until you come down to the mining and space exploration. See, those upgrades you need for your ship and characters will play a huge role in determining who lives and dies in the endgame (the whole mission is seen as a suicide mission after all) so if you want everyone to live, you got to upgrade everyone to the brink including your ship and how do you do that? By waving your cursor around a planet and firing a probe whenever a spike happens on your meter and it's, well it's tedious. Granted it's not supposed to be fun or you'd be upgraded to the max before you hit the 10 hour mark but still, doesn't have to be this unfun. Also, this is a minor nitpick but there's a character you get in your squad at the end of the game that is so cool yet so late addition that by the time you recruit him, you're literally near the end.For those of you curious, the Collector's edition comes with a neat little artbook as well as a comic which details events that happen inbetween the first game and this game and they involve Liara (who by the way, turned into a real ***** in this game), the Collector armor and rifle where he kind of looks like Guyver but insect-like as well as the making-of/wallpaper disc like in Dragon Age. All in all it's a good edition though I hope the pre-order exclusive armor is put up for sale as well.As far as the game itself, this was definately a surprise since I knew it was highly anticipated and everyone was gonna play it but the first game wasn't completely masterpiece-level but like that ol' assassin's game, sometimes the first game is just a leadup to the better thing and if that's the case, well, Mass Effect 3 already can't get here soon enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

The key reason is that they had a winning formula from the begining (smackdown on PS1) in their control style, adjusted certain areas over time, and all of them leads to this.  Smackdown 1 established the control style, smackdown 2 established the story mode idea as well as large variety of matches, smackdown 3 increased # of Matches as well as wrestlers and Create A Wrestler, but dummed down the the story mode, now in this one you have all the awsome stuff from the past three as well as the best story mode ever to be created in a wrestling game.THe story mode strickly focus on you, and also the the 2 owners (Flair and McMahon).  Depending on who you are (as well as what branch you are on) you either start at the top of the ladder or the bare bottom.  From there you work your way to the ultimate goal, the WWE Undisputed Championship.  The easiest way to do that is the win, and win up until you are champion and then the story really gets interesting.  What happens than is that whichever branch you are on the owner will congradulate you, and if you choose to do so be on his side (Flair = Face, McMahon = Heel) and than the other Owner will apear and the war will begin.  This war will continue until Survivor Series which the war will end, but in a matter of Vengeance (assuming you are still champ by then) you get thrown in to a 6 man armageddon Hell in the Cell match, which if you win you shall win the respect of the fans and both Owners and you still have another year to go after all of this.That is an example of a winning story mode, I left out some minor details that I encounterd because the game is focused on surprises.Now for the problems:1: The Womens championship is now gone, thus for some the creation of Women wrestlers makes it almost pointless.  They can sometimes wrestle (the divas) but mostly they are there as managers and to seduce your guy for their own purposes.  Which for some it can be seen that way but for others it looks pretty dumb (they sent Jazz out to seduce my guy).2: IF you were only OK at the past ones than you need to spend a lot of time in Exibition before the story because the controls are more refined and you will get you ...handed to you if you are not careful.3: What happened to Create-Your-own-Move, you can make a taunt, walk, finishing pose, and run, but you can't make your own move.4: Still no create your own PPV!!!OVerall with that said, you have the best of the series.  With refined control, outstanding story mode, and loads of secrets this is the wrestilng game to own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2002"}

The game follows the journey of Conan the Cimmerian as he fights an epic battle against a variety of enemies and an elusive evil power that threatens to consume the world. Using anything and everything at his disposal, including hand-to-hand weapons, objects in the environment, and powerful elemental magic, Conan takes the fight to his enemies across the massive continent of Hyborea.","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"Holds up as a great classic hack & slash years later","reviewText":"Those who are fans of God of War as myself will find the game play familiar for sure but honestly the two games could not be further apart in terms of art direction and story.It is unfair to say Conan is simply a God Of War ripoff because it is a hack and slash. There are plenty of other games who share genres such as Call Of Duty and Killzone which both fall into the fps spectrum. Conan is just that a great hack and slash which fits into the same genre as God Of War.The gameplay however is not as mindless as you would think. It takes skill and learning the moves and which weapons to choose depending on you enemies that will take you down if you do not choose wisely.Boss battles are also unique and offer up a variety of their own challenges that will make your palms sweat and have you cursing at the screen when you fail. Only to leave you with great satisfaction upon victory.The game art is beautiful and has held up because the choice was made to offer up a style that is more akin to a matte painting rather then the dated look some games have which lend themselves to the time frame in which they were released. I would say similar to Heavenly Sword on the PS3 which also has held up quite well and falls into this genre.Conan is also voiced by some great A list talent. The lead being none other then Ron Perlmen which adds weight to the amount of real effort that went into the development of this game. It is closer to the real Conan then the fan Hollywood favorite starring Arnold. Which is enjoyable in it's own right but is not accurate in terms of depth. If you want to know what the real Conan is supposed to be from the actual books this is a quick way to your path of discovery.The good news is that the game won't break your wallet ether. You can usually pick this up used for about $5 or less with shipping. Worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Marketed Incorrectly as a Cornerstone Game","reviewText":"Shigeru Miyamoto is the owner of a fertile imagination. Very few who know his name will argue that point, and fewer still will argue the quality of his work. As perhaps the greatest asset still under Nintendo's grasp, his fame is surprisingly low-key. Little more than the most hard-core gamers know of his existence, but everyone who's ever seen a joystick has a pretty extensive knowledge of his creations. Super Mario Brothers. Donkey Kong. The Legend of Zelda. Mario Kart. F-Zero. Starfox. Super Smash Brothers. It reads like a top ten list of Nintendo's greatest achievements, and it all stems back to one man. So, naturally, when this guy's motivated to flesh out a new idea it's a pretty newsworthy event.Such was the circumstance when Pikmin was revealed to the world near the launch of the GameCube in late 2001. It was promoted as the system's &quot;must-have&quot; launch title, a role in which any of the famed creator's previous titles would have soared. Unfortunately, Pikmin isn't a game I'd classify as a cornerstone in any sense of the word, which is what Nintendo desperately needed at that point in time. Every bit of the Miyamoto-trademarked addictive gameplay, uncensored originality and effortless simplicity is here in full force, but the game never took off because of the way it was marketed. As an understated, unheralded underground success released a year or two after the first-wave launch titles, this game would have taken the gaming world by storm. As the central focus of a next-gen console, it was horribly misplaced and, along with Nintendo itself, quickly lost in the shuffle.Which is a shame, because this is a really enjoyable little package. It tackles a number of cliches that have plagued the gaming scene for years, gathers several completely unrelated genres and produces a game that you've never seen anything even remotely like. It successfully proves that higher framerates, larger numbers of polygons and faster processors haven't completely eliminated the kind of light hearted, inexplicably believable experience that used to fill every game on the old NES and Atari.This isn't the best looking game on the market, nor does it need to be. The real magic of Pikmin is in its simplicity, which is something that's wisely protected by keeping the game's environments understated and clean. It is a little disconcerting to see how flat some of the textures are upon close inspection, but since the majority of the game is played from a distant overhead perspective, this is a minor qualm at best. The Pikmin, Olimar and the enemies, however, skirt this issue as they're all composed of flat colors with little noticeable detailing at all. And though that sounds like a blatant red flag, it's done consistently enough to ward off any presumptions that this might have been done as a last second method of cutting corners. This is a title that appears exactly as it was meant to, with the tiny, brightly colored creatures appearing eerily at home amongst the familiar, photorealistic blades of grass, twigs and soil. It's funny, the graphics of Pikmin fluctuate so easily between distinct realism and blatant oversimplification that the lines themselves start to blur. It becomes the meeting point between detail and simplicity, with an end product that's all the more believable because of that.Upon his discovery of the Pikmin, Olimar also discovers their undying need to follow his direction. Unless he tells them otherwise, nearby Pikmin will follow our central character around the world. They'll put their lives on the line to defend him from much larger adversaries. They'll build bridges for him, or carry enormous objects with the proportionate strength of an ant if it'll aid his journeys. That the game's writers chose not to elaborate on these tiny creatures' undying love for the title's main character makes it all the more interesting and open for interpretation.Whether they fall into the river and drown, attempt to run through a fountain of fire or stupidly assault the largest enemy in the forest on their lonesome, you WILL lose Pikmin in the field on a regular basis, which becomes a point of agony as the game progresses. It's strange to imagine, but after spending the time to create, uproot and command these little creatures, you develop a sort of parental attachment to them, which eventually becomes the real attraction as the hours go on. It's truly disturbing to watch a large forest creature devour a handful of them in one fell swoop, and that's an emotion I don't usually get from playing a video game.It's this element of survival, mixed with a brief, thirty day timeframe (a game day lasts about half an hour) and a series of mind-teasing, difficult puzzles that really gives Pikmin its substantial appeal. There's a definite Lemmings vibe to some of the levels, both with their simplicity and their nerve-wracking addictive nature. You'll spend hours upon hours trying to sort your way through a particularly difficult puzzle, only to discover the answer was right in front of your face the whole time. Everything is arranged to follow a blatant learning curve, but it never really seems to get in the way or detract from the overall picture.As I said before, Pikmin would've made a great second or third year addition to the GameCube's lineup. It's a much deeper game than the simplified graphics of the front cover would lead you to believe, always there to inspire thought rather than to sate your appetite for gratuitous violence. It straddles the action / adventure, strategy and puzzle genres, and stands head and shoulders above the leading titles in each category today. It's a deceptively addicting little package, and though it lacks a bit in length and replay value, it's more than worth the current asking price. There's a very solid concept here, which I hope to see fleshed out a little further in the forthcoming sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2004"}

I got this game for Christmas in 2004.  I have played it all but exclusively every since.  No kidding.  People have given me other games, have tried to expose me, and yet--nothing can succeed in tearing me away.  I've seen several games come out and thought \"wow, I'd really like to play that...and yet--its not WoW.\"  Why that is I can't say for sure, but I do know for a fact that World of Warcraft has given me many times my money's worth.Other reviewers are correct about several things.  The initial game is essentially a race to the maximum level, set at 60 right now.  You do quests, group with others, or a take it alone as you work your way up through the game and truly \"learn\" your character.  Once you hit 60 the game changes, and it becomes about constantly tweaking and improving your character.  There is also the player versus player (PvP) aspect, which, though frustrating at times, can be incredibly addicting if you love online competition the way I do.Now let me say that I am not a \"hardcore\" player.  I play almost every night, but I don't put 8-12 hours in like others do.  I'm not in one of the big guilds mentioned by others, and do not dedicate a major part of my life to getting the best gear.  Instead I try to enjoy the game, exploring the new content Blizzard is constantly adding (and they are adding new stuff quite often) and working toward the best gear I can get based on the time I'm willing to commit to the game.  There is a strong social aspect to the game, and peer pressure and such do exist, but you have to accept that when you play a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game).Blizzard claims that this is the MMORPG for the casual gamer.  I have to agree with them, at least in part.  At one time there were over 2000 available quests in the game, and that number continues to grow as they modify the game through \"patches.\"  It seems at times like the company caters to only its hardcore fans, but at the same time its impossible not to acknoowledge the sheer content available for the casual gamer.I've leveled 2 characters to 60 and done much end game content.  I've also got many lower level characters that I enjoy.  This game is incredibly rewarding if you put the time into it.  I highly recommend it regardless of your level of play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2006"}

I own both PS3 and xbox 360 and also the Wii. When the current Generation started I had a decision to make and thats buy a Xbox 360 or PS3. With Xbox coming out a year earlier and PS3 couple of days to release I decided to go with the PS3. Sony sold me on what they have shown with the power of the PS3. 6 years have past and have not been disappointed with my decision. The system came with WiFi, bluetooth, 4 USB slots, and Memory card slots. Also not to forget the PS1 and ps2 backwards compatible. The slick chrome makes this system stand out than any of the new models. The Ps3 is little heavier back then but it was a heavy duty console. Since the System is old i had only one Yellow light of death and have to get it replace by Sony and which it wasn't under the warranty. Cost me $150 to replace my system or pay $200 for one of the newest models. I decided to replace it. Sony send me another right away. This System does lack on hard drive space with only 60gb. The good thing about the PS3 is upgrading the hard drive. This systems are rare to find because this are the only systems with 4 slots of USB, memory card slots, and PS1 and PS2 backwards compatible. It does have some negatives with the Yellow light of death but its really low percentage that it will happen. Also with 60gb of hard drive but its upgradable. Overall Im loving the PS3 since day one and will keep supporting it. With a great game catalog and upcoming PS3 exclusives the PS3 still has a long life time.

I am writing this review  as an objective review. If you are a die hard fan of the series, you probably will buy this game, and if you hate nintendo games you will most likely avoid it. This review is not for you people, it is for those who are interested but undecided. It is not particularly biased, but it is still an opinion. My only aim is to help, so treat my review as such.For anyone who has not played a mario kart game, here is the skinny: pick a Mario mascot, pick a wacky kart, and race across various themed tracks, and achieve victory or failure by utilizing the various \"items\" (power ups and weapons). The mario kart franchise popularized the item-based kart racer, and each previous version was successful at doing so by balancing items and racing that utilizing both driving and weapons was key to winning. Mario kart has always been a \"party game\" which means it is best played with friends, and is accessable for all ages and skill levels, while also appealing to vets. Mario kart Wii is the latest and arguably the best mario kart to date, but that does not mean that it is without problems.Mario Kart Wii sticks with the the old formula and should feel very familiar at first. This is a good thing because previous mario karts were very fun. The most drastic change is the inclusion of dirt bikes into the mix. They offer a alternative way to race, while also adding a new tricks system. The mechanics work quite well and go hand in hand with the other big change, the steering wheel included. The steering wheel includeded in the game's package encourages play with the wii-mote, allowing players to steer the controller to produce the desired effect in the game. It works well, but it is apparent that it is a novelty, luckily there are plenty of other control options for playing, including the gamecube controller.But back to the bikes. Thanks to the new tricks system, nintendo decided to design the tracks with the tricks in mind. The result is a lot of half pipes and jumps; the tracks look like a mixture between a skate park and a rollercoaster. It is a very fun, and it works well until items come into play. The items were designed for kart racing and not biking and tricks. biking becomes unenjoyable with items constantly hindering you. this leads into the games biggest problems.Items appear way too frequently and will hurt you more than they will help. There are too many items now that are impossible to defend against, many of which affect everyone playing. Items in previous mario kart games required more thought to execution and the target could defend himself, this coupled with the fact that items are more frequent and there are now 12 racers instead of 8, means a racer will be a victem much more often. While an element of luck has been a part of every mario kart game, players will go from first to last within a matter of seconds. A lot of skill has been drained from racing, making victory a matter of who happens to get the best items closest to the finish line.Another issue is that single player grand prix mode, (the meat of the single player experience), suffers from horrible \"rubber band\" AI. This means that the game is designed so that there will always be computers on your tail. even if you should be leaving them in the dust, the computers when falling too far behind will go faster than technically possible to catch up to keep close to you. It keeps the game chaotic to an unnecessary level and leaves you feeling cheated.Fortunately, most of the issues are alleviated in multiplayer mode. There are no computer issues in multiplayer, and items can be regulated in the settings menu to keep things a little more balanced. Multiplayer is the real draw of this game, it is fun and stimulating with friends, and is best enjoyed in a social manner. Online multiplayer is an even bigger feat. Online is seamless, offering great quality matches with almost no lag or hitches. Online comes complete with its own chanel, allowing you to track scores and tournaments for you and your friends. The ranking system, integration, and sheer depth of the online aspect is unheard of so far in a Wii game. It pushes the bar for Wii online content, doing it better than any game has in the past.Otherwise, Graphics and sound are kind of crappy and kiddy, but they are clean, and get the job done. To be honest, graphics do not play a huge role in this game, but nothing is to offensive, nor should anything be an issue.So what is the verdict? It is a tough choice. If you are hoping that you will be playing mostly single player and occasional multiplayer to get by, this is probably not the game for you. The single player is weak, and the system itself is plagued with imbalance issues, which can only be alleviated by the distraction of other people. If you plan on playing a lot of multiplayer or online, this game is much more valuable in terms of  quality content.Over all it is a solid 4 out of 5 thanks to spectacular multiplayer, but imbalanced single player and game mechanics","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQ9","description":"The layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Buttons are easy to access, and the controller is comfortable","reviewText":"Though not as comfortable as the GameCube's controller, the PS2 Dualshock is a great controller.  All buttons are easy to access, and feel natural to use.  I am still using the original controller, and I haven't had any problems (it's at least 3 years old).

I don't have a whole lot of time to devote to gaming, so when I do sit down to play, I want to feel like I'm making progress. So far, that hasn't been tremendously the case with this game.

It is a testemant to why substance is so much greater than bling, and is considered one of the defining games of the genre.  Of all the RPGs I have played, this is one of two that has a permanent spot of my Hard Disk (other being Torment).  If you have never played it you owe it to yourself to do so, if only to see what makes for a truly great game.Yes, the graphics are out-dated.  Yes the battle is turn-based.  Yes, this is the example of how it is to be done.  You will in fact appreciate turn based battle after experiencing Fallout and Fallout2.  And you will see how these graphics in fact add to the game play not take away from it.  They set the atmosphere of the game (dirty).There is something very satisfying about hearing the \"SPLAT\" followed by the \"AAAAAAAAH\" as a circle of flesh blows out from the side of an advancing Mutant, caused by your Shotgun blast (with the gun affectionately known as the Pancor JackHammer).And just as satisfying is the \"ZZZZT\" \"UUUUUUUUUH\" you get from frying some punk, using your energy weapon.  A great four seconds of animation as you watch the vermin's body zizzle from top down then bottom up, skelotal remains finalling falling to the ground in a \"THUMP\".Or if you prefer the really big guns, you can go for something like the Flame Thrower.  Good Golly Molly, how long can that guy run around burning aflame before he becomes a final crispy critter mess.And unlike many games with sequels, both these games are very worth playing.  You will enjoy all aspects of the game from character creation, to battle, to quests, to researching online how to enhance your game playing experience.  Get it while you can.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

After all, there are now three major consoles on the market, each boasting its advantages.  In the end, however, I stuck with my old and stalwart friend, Nintendo.  Ever since the days of my original Nintendo system back in the mid 80s, I have frittered away countless precious hours of my life to playing games, games, and more games.  I hoped the Gamecube would live up to the standard of its predecessors, and I was not disappointed.To me, one thing matters more than graphics, sound, etc.  That thing is gameplay.  And, for a variety of utterly enjoyable and very playable games, its hard to beat Nintendo.  My friend has a PS2, but since I got my Gamecube I find we haven't used it much.  The Gamecube is great because it contains such classic series as the Mario series, Zelda, Starfox, and one which recently returned to the forefront--Metroid.  All in all, I absolutely love Nintendo's games, and find myself much more entertained with the games available on this system than those on the PS2 or the Xbox.To me, this is the best system out there.  It's also the cheapest.  If you're struggling with the decision of which console to pick, I highly recommend the Gamecube.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2003"}

David Swan","summary":"Essential DS game","reviewText":"Trauma Center manages to take the title away from Kirby for the best usage ever of the DS touch screen. This is exactly the kind of game the DS was designed for and the kind of game that could exist on no other platform ever created. Trauma Center literally gives you a hands on experience at being a surgeon. Although the surgeries are often more fantasy than reality many of the terms and procedures are real.Early surgeries are pretty easy and most can be conquered on a single try but the game  ramps up fairly quickly. The strange thing is that one of the toughest surgeries in the game appears rather early in the game. After quite a few tries I managed to complete it but I certainly can imagine some people getting absolutely stuck. Fortunately the game is so much fun that repeating the surgery dozens of times never grew tedious.Surgeries generally last from 3 to 10 minutes and the game often reaches a level of tension that players may literally feel like they just completed an actual operation. Many of the reviews I've read online claim the game is an upgraded version of the old board game operation. That is a complete mischaracterization. The only similarities are that both use the surgery theme. In Trauma Center you create incisions, drain tumors, slice and reattach veins, laser polyps, suture wounds and so much more.Trauma Center is a game that combines a great idea with stellar execution. The only other game by Atlus I ever played was Astro Boy for the GBA. It got great reviews and had terrific game play but settled for some mediocre sales. Hopefully Trauma Center will do better because DS owners really owe it to themselves to play a game that capitalizes so successfully on the strengths of the DS. It's also a decent bargain at $29.95.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0041HROGG","description":"","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"Review from a non-experienced Xbox user.","reviewText":"As my title suggests, I'm not an expert in the world of Xbox.  In fact, I don't even own an Xbox.  Why did I get this controller?  Simply to use with my computer, and I really wanted an Xbox controller (I own the PS3 and Wii, so those are covered).Anyway, I've been wanting to get this after all the phenomenal reviews of the 360 controller, and was going to get the glossy black one until I heard the announcement about this special edition.  Because I mainly want to use it for old-school emulations (and the occasional Halo), I thought the transforming d-pad would be neat.  I got it a week early from another website, and I can say without hesitation that I'm glad I made the purchase.I've hardly used Xbox 360 controllers, so I can't compare it to previous and current models, but the d-pad is a welcome addition.  It does feel different jutted out, but the only issue is that it feels kind of \"squishy,\" if that makes sense.  It's not as smooth or tactile as other d-pads (DualShock and Super Nintendo), but it gets the job done.  The d-pad is easy to transform, and stays in place due to a locking mechanism.  As another reviewer mentioned, this seems to be the same d-pad as other Xbox 360 controllers, but the transforming helps to have better control over the directions.The monochrome look is nice, and I can see why Microsoft did it (to save money and have it blend well with the silver tone of the controller).  I would prefer convex (not concave, right?) analog sticks as I tend to put the the middle of my thumb over them rather than the tip, but I'll live.The top triggers are great, but the bottom two squeak (not sure if that's a common trait amongst these controllers).  And to note: this d-pad is NOT a feature among all or future Xbox 360 controllers.  It is specific to this silver controller, and the words \"Special Edition\" are stamped right on the packaging.It comes with a Play and Charge kit as well as a regular battery case, which I use instead, seeing as Eneloops pretty much dominate other rechargeable batteries.P.S.In case you were wondering, I use this on my MacBook Pro.  It's a pain in the butt to get some games to work seeing as I'm using a Microsoft product on an Apple computer, but once I get Bootcamp running I'm sure it'll be smooth sailing from there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"H. A Huffman \"haumf\"","summary":"4 and 1/2 Stars. This game is really Good &amp; Spooky","reviewText":"First of all, I am biased. I love most of Clive Barker's work and I liked the movies based on his writings. But that doesn't mean I gave him a free pass while evaluating this game. Also, I never purchased Unreal Tournament (just didn't like the whole concept).After playing the game for about two hours, I am completely lost in the big Irish mansion (well, actually, I just opened the wrong door and I am now lost in some lower dimension), running low on health and have &quot;died&quot; about 4 times already but I like this game. The game's engine is wonderful: The lighting effects, textures and character movement are great. The plot is also wonderful; it's the main reason why I don't get that sense of futility that comes with playing mediocre games.This game does have the familiar &quot;find the key&quot; type puzzle but it does not have the standard &quot;run - jump - shoot&quot; action of most FPS games. Undying is more like a &quot;walk - investigate - what happened to the lights? - duck! - that's not my reflection in the mirror! - NOW run&quot; type of game. This game adds many Barkerish touches (the long gloomy hallway with the white curtains wafting gently across it - pure genius.) that add to Undying's quality.Aside from the care taken by Undying's creators to provide the right atmosphere, the user interface is very easy to understand and configure. The dual weapon/spell control is a little daunting at first, but I am getting used to it.One reviewer compared this game to \"Resident Evil\". That game is a mess that bored me to tears. Undying is a really engrossing, spooky adventure. Electronic Arts and Mr. Barker have created a superior gaming product that is well worth Amazon's price and my prediction is that it will be popular for many years.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2001"}

But make no mistake: This isn't some rushed piece of garbage simply set out to make money off the GTA franchise. It has a little bit of TLC put into it by the game developers, as well.Similarities to GTA:-You can do storyline and free roaming missions-steal and customize cars-participate in Turf Wars taking over neighborhoods for your gang-customize your main character-wield a large variety of guns-listen to a large variety of music-and generally play the game however way you want.Enhancements over GTA:-Much superior graphics-better map-a GPS system for your maps and vehicles-customizable cell phone, with allies you can call for backup-customizable music playlists (in case you get sick of the randomness of the radio stations and want to hear your music anywhere, anytime)-the hands-down BEST car customization in any non-racing video game, ever!-health items (food) you can access anytime-self-regenerating health that heals up from about-to-die to full health in about one minute or so-superior firearms (albeit none of them look very unique)-a slightly better menu interface to access your firearms (I just wish they hadn't put the food and weapons in the same system; it gets confusing)-the police are the most minor threat in the game-public transportation is available to you (although you more than likely will never use it)-if you find yourself stuck in water, you can skip having to swim to shore with the \"warp\" feature, which will do that for you. Pretty cool feature! Why aren't things like that in other games?-shooting style & difficulity are fair (The shot target is in the fixed-center of the screen and you move the camera to aim, but it's a little harder to use then in GTA)-both men, AND women, can be recruited as allies in your gang, or killed in other gangs. Hurray for murder equality!-celebrity voice acting (I instantly recognized Mila Kunis as Tanya and Michael Rapaport as Troy)Worse from GTA:-No bikes or motorcycles to ride which is diaspointing-no boats or planes either (not that they're really needed here)-character can barely swim-only one safehouse in the entire city/game-clothes choices are lame and uninspired-despite the good voice acting, the dialogue is terrible and it sounds like it was written by the whitest people on the planet (shades of \"187: Ride or Die\")-an excessive overuse of cursing (if you're going to use it in every other word, it's impact and gravitas is completely lost)-the A.I. is stupid, and the enemy gangs have that \"random spawning\" effect whenever you have a \"wanted level\" by them-it's mandatory to do the side missions as you have to earn \"respect\" in order to do the main storyline missions, and respect is only gained from the side missions-many of the side missions are hard or just plain annoying, like the later level Escort missions-your character, although he has great stamina, has terrible running animation, and trying to shoot while running just looks retarded.-the prices of things are way too high/too much (if you're just staring off and haven't saved up any cash, a fifty dollar hamburger may be a bit much). I'd prefer them if they kept them at \"real-world\" prices.-the \"humor\" of the game is just weak and lacks any level of subtlety whatsoever, like the Wendy's burger chain parody, \"Freckle B*tch's\" for example-the radio stations are horribly put together, and their names are awful, too.-the music is generic and lame, and there's only a few \"name brand\" artists contributing to the game's soundtrack. Mainly, the Clipse and Twista.-there's no difficulity setting and the main missions in the game are a bit too easy (while the side missions are often too hard)-the \"escape the police\" method in this game is weak and lame. It's a drive-thru confessional booth, not that you'll ever really need to use it. I never even been in \"Forgive and Forget\" before.-your recruited allies are complete idiots and you'll spend more time than anything reviving them because they rushed headlong into a dozen or so shooting enemies. They're more of a hassle to use than any kind of help, sort of like bringing young children along for grocery shopping.-it's pretty easy to die in situations that don't call for it. Your health bar, despite it's regeneration, can't take much damage and a few shots from two or more enemies can take you from full health to death pretty quickly. Like, in three seconds quickly. This is darn frustrating and happens A LOT in the stupid Pushback missions that pop up randomally that you can't avoid skipping over.-there's NO Body Armor, anywhere in this game, which only adds on to the annoying \"easy to die\" problem I mentioned above.-the randomally popping up, mandatory \"defend your turf against invading gangs\" Pushback Missions. They were just as random and annoying in San Andreas and they're even more annoying here. What's worse is, in order to successfully defend your turf, you'll have to seek out special \"lieutenants\" instead of just killing everybody in sight. And these 12 or so lieutenants tend to hide out in weird, hard-to-reach places, and you'll have to make your way through dozens of enemies, risking your life, just to make your way to them. It was easier in GTA when you just had to kill everybody invading your land. Here, you'll literally be in an urban battlefield going against dozens of enemies, making your way to one of the four spots in the area your enemy lieutenats are at. (they only hang out three at a time and are scattered wide across the entire neighborhood warzone.) The worse thing about these missions are that they're more or less mandatory, and you won't have time to save whenever they pop up, and they'll pop up often after JUST completing a really hard mission or side quest. At least in San Andreas, it was fun to do these missions, partly because they were do in intervals and all you had to do is be the last man standing. Here, they're just a REALLY annoying chore.-each gun has it's own set of bullets, making it hard to get ammo. In other games like GTA, bullets are shared between guns of similar types (universal pistol ammo, universal shotgun ammo, etc.), but here, each gun is different with it's own unique bullets in them, and you can only have one gun type (pistol, shotgun, etc.) at a time. BUT, because you can't use ammo from other guns, that you'll often find off of dead bodies, you'll constantly be having to decide whether to swap your gun that's low on ammo out for the one of a gang member you just shot. If so, you'll quickly run of of ammo for that, too. If not, you'll just have an empty gun on you. And thus, you'll be deciding which gun you have that is more fuel efficent, quite often in heavily heated turf wars or in missions with tons of enemies to kill. What's worse is every single gangster carries different random guns on them. If the Vice Kings just all had Vice pistols and the Carnales had a different pistol type they all shared, it'd be a lot simplier. But, no, every time you kill someone, it's \"do I run out of ammo, or pick this up instead, even though it only has five more bullets in it than the one I already have?\" Basically, you'll easily use up all the ammo for whichever gun you have and will have to replace it for another gun (which only has a few bullets in it) and back and fourth like so. (In other words: YOU'RE *ALWAYS* RUNNING OUT OF AMMO!)Overall, Saint's Row is a worthy edition to the GTA genre of video games. Although it's a rip-off, in every sense of the word, it's defintely not of inferior quality.  In fact, Saint's Row is even better than most of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The game, at it's core is nice, but what really bogs it down are the minor negatives, which as you can see, really begin to add up. The game is much better than Three Stars, but all these little things keep it from being Five Star worthy. Other than the numerous minor flaws, the only problem is the story, which is pretty lame and generic, and the script, which is just laughably cheesy in it's attempt to sound \"urban\" or \"gangsta\" or \"hip hop\" or whatever. San Andreas' dialogue and script felt 100% genuine. Saint's Rows, however, sounds forced, like they were too lazy to do their research and just decided to \"wing it.\"It would be easy to just make a Grand Theft Auto clone that's pretty bad (True Crime has proved that, for us). It would also be pretty easy to try to make your own game, using many of the famous GTA elements involved (I.E, CrackDown). But Saint's Row, however, is a true Grand Theft Auto imitation, that manages not to photocopy the game, but use it as a worthy starting off point for their own series. I like mostly everything in this game, and the only real things keeping it from being superior to every GTA game ever made on the older consoles, is it's cheesy dialogue, numerous small annoyances, it's and cheesy writing, and lame attempts to be \"funny.\"Other than that, Saint's Row is a worthy duplication of the \"sandbox shooting and driving\" genre created by GTA itself, and it definitely deserves to be played, even if only as a week-long rental, by ANY Grand Theft Auto fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Incredibly mediocre single player","reviewText":"I don't care about how GREAT AND HARROWING AND INNOVATIVE the multiplayer experience is touted as being.  I gave it a shot, was unimpressed, and don't particularly find the concept of little kids screaming racial slurs and older men insulting their mothers very appealing while having to deal with gutterslime who spend 9 hours a day playing online and can snipe me from half across the map while I'm still trying to get used to movement that feels like I'm on rollerskates and get over the fact that using my knife permanently switches the knife to active weapon until I switch it out again.And don't even start, I say to the invisible reader I am unable to hear, with the comparisons to Call of Duty games.  In my mind, if the only support you have for this game is a comparison with Modern Warfare 3, then you've already lost.  If you have to sell me a game by trashing on a completely different game, that pretty much exposes your game as second-rate in my mind.And regardless of that, we have a balance; Modern Warfare 3 sucks.  Battlefield 3 sucks.  Balance.Since my experience was primarily with the singleplayer (since that's all I really cared about) I give it the benefit of the doubt with multiplayer and only judge based on single player and controls.The story; there's no real way to avoid pointing out that it's a rip-off of the Modern Warfare series' storyline, but given what I say above, I'm not going to judge it based on comparing with the MW series, but it's inevitable that I have to point out the parallels with the Modern Warfare series.The story begins with the inexplicable situation of marine sergeant Blackburn apparently arrested by civilian police in New York, claiming he knows a terrorist nuclear attack will occur in New York THAT DAY and he knows who.  INEXPLICABLY, they treat him like it's BS and start harassing and taunting him incessantly throughout the entire \"interrogation\".  Exactly why is unknown, and we expect it'll be revealed to us during the game.Flashbacks play out the missions.  The first mission is pretty much derived from COD4's \"Shock and Awe\", only with Iran, and with the nuclear strike replaced with a suspiciously convenient earthquake.  An earthquake.  So now we can get out of the way that Battlefield 3 is in no way more or less realistic than Modern Warfare.The story gradually unfolds showing Blackburn involved in assaults in Iran against an organization called the \"PLR\", and chasing after a guy whose name I totally forgot and I only remember as BF3's version of COD4's Al-Asad.  Simultaneously, we have Russian agents, player character called \"Dima\" hunting the REAL bad guys; eastern european terrorists or something.  A copy of COD4 with the SAS going after Imran Zakhaev.The story goes that NotAl-Asad got ahold of some briefcase nukes, and two are missing when the Americans invade his palace.  I point out that TWO are missing, because we can clearly see the third one still in the case, and because later in the game, they suddenly say that THREE were missing.The missions are sometimes incoherent and in some pretty blatant cases, completely irrelevant or unrelated to the story.  There's one segment where the police detectives chew out Blackburn over some air force pilot doing her job in bombing Iranian targets and dogfighting, apparently implying that she was involved in a conspiracy with Blackburn.  We play through that mission, and suddenly this pilot is NEVER mentioned again and play NO ROLE AT ALL in the continuing story.Other such missions seem repetitive, in some instances I'm playing a mission that feels exactly like another mission played an hour before, with the dialogue and story pretty much being no different.  Suddenly we're in a helicopter with NotAl-Asad, leaving Iran.  Suddenly we're trapped in Iran again, and need an armored division of tanks to rescue us.  Suddenly the tanks can't find us.  Suddenly we're back in Iran doing a mission that involves escaping.Meanwhile, we learn that the REAL bad guy is a terrorist called Solomon.  Who he is, why he's doing this, what his strength is, how many followers he has, how he got ahold of NotAl-Asad's nukes, we don't know.  None of this is ever revealed or explored.  For some reason, the police detectives claim that \"Dima\" is a bad guy.  Exactly why or how, we don't know.Then we get a mission in Russia, where they try to go after a Russian arms dealer named Kaffarov.  Suddenly RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE ATTACKING.  This next bit is very important, because it's completely ignored later on, and then completely abandoned;The Russians are apparently going after Kaffarov as well.  And they'll go through the Americans in the process.  This is not an act of war, apparently, so it's not an act of war when the Americans fight back.This is important because later on, AFTER one of Solomon's nukes goes off in Paris, the detectives tell Blackburn NO ONE CARES ABOUT SOLOMON; THE REAL ENEMIES ARE THE RUSSIANS!  It wasn't made clear whether they blamed the Russians for the nuke in Paris, but considering that NOTHING AT ALL was said of Russia's political or military move following this, considering that NO FURTHER HOSTILITIES TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE AMERICANS AND RUSSIANS, this not only makes no sense, but assumes that these police detectives are dictating to a marine sergeant that they are AT WAR WITH RUSSIA.  This coming explicitly AFTER it was said that the attack during the raid on Kaffarov was NOT an act of war.So what happens next?  It's finally revealed to us what happened with Kaffarov; \"Dima\" and his team took him down, and Sergeant Blackburn arrives just as Kaffarov is unconscious and Dima stays behind to warn Blackburn that Solomon has his nukes and is going to use them.What follows is the most poorly executed scene in any first person shooter I've ever played.  While Blackburn is hearing Dima in Kaffarov's shot-out villa, Dima drops his gun and turns around, then suddenly a random Marine bursts in, screaming and yelling barely coherently, apparently telling BLACKBURN (and not the Russian guy) to drop his weapon.  Less than two seconds after this, HE SHOOTS AND KILLS BLACKBURN!I had no effing idea what the hell that was supposed to be!  There was no indication of what to do!  Considering that it's later revealed he is ON MY OWN FRIGGIN SQUAD, it makes NO SENSE AT ALL that he'd suddenly burst into the room and threaten HIS FELLOW SQUADMATE instead of the Russian guy.So, because the game didn't bother to tell me what to do, I assumed that if this guy is going to shoot and kill me for no reason, I had better shoot him first.  So the second time around, he bursts in, and I find that I can shoot him down BEFORE he even starts shouting and screaming incoherently.Considering that this comes all of a sudden, it means that this scene has failed in its intent EVEN WHEN I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO!  The intent, as the next cutscene with the police shows, is that Blackburn apparently betrayed his country to help a Russian agent and murdered his superior officer.  The way it played out, the moronic superior officer burst into the room screaming and yelling, and Blackburn ACCIDENTALLY shot him.I make this a big issue because THIS IS THE EVENT THAT LEADS TO THE POLICE INTERROGATION.  THIS IS THE EVENT that has Blackburn as somehow a traitor and terrorist sympathizer.  Complete and total failure.The end-game features another poorly staged scene, in which for no reason whatsoever, Blackburn is LEFT ALONE in a room WITH ONE OF HIS SQUADMATES who is suddenly put in the room with him, without explanation, and he EASILY convinces the squadmate to help him break out.  Then he goes to the subway, where he conveniently encounters Solomon and his group on a hijacked train.  Train crashes, car chase, then end-game with Blackburn saving the world from nuclear annihilation.The game then ends with Dima, apparently alive after being in Paris when the nuke went off, apparently writing the events in his memoirs.  For no discernable reason, there's a knock on his door and he pulls a gun, as if ready to go out and die in a hail of bullets.  Exactly why, or what the hell happened, we just don't know.  We barely even know who the hell Dima is, much less who would be hunting him down and why.Adding to the frustration of the poorly written, plothole-gaping storyline is the presence of my old enemy, QUICKTIME EVENTS!  Call of Duty series has some events like this; but they are not quicktime events; you get attacked by a dog, or by someone with a knife or bayonet, you hit RS button (on Xbox) as soon as you can and as many times as you can.  Simple as that.Here, you have to play Simon Says with the Effing game, hitting Y or A or X or RS or RB at the right time, or else you die.  And it's not a once in a while thing, but at least once in EVERY mission, and even THREE TIMES IN A SINGLE MISSION.As for gameplay;It was somewhat difficult for me to adapt to the controls, which are pretty much just like Call of Duty, but with the RS stick for crouching, A button doing nothing, Left bumper being grenades, and Right bumper being knife, and the Knife not going away after the first slash.More frustrating for me is the fact that the handling---movement, gun handling, etcetera---is realistic... for the player.  As in, it handles less like a FULLY TRAINED EXPERIENCED MARINE and more like a fat, out of shape civilian.  You can run a lot, yes, but your gun handling is terrible; kickback is extreme, movement is sluggish and sloppy, as if you were constantly wearing a backpack full of bricks that weighed half as much as you do.  And the slippery movement as well; you move as if the floor is wet; you can accelerate, and slide when stopping.  It's barely much, like a slide of just a half an inch, yet it's extremely noticeable and constantly threw me off.And one last thing to complain about; the graphics.  I only had the Single player CD to play with, so I couldn't install the special HD graphics into the game.  For a game needing TWO discs, and a story mode in no way longer or deeper than a Call of Duty game, this is inexplicable.  Without the HD graphics installed, the graphics are cheap and second-rate, worse even than Call of Duty 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Faden \"robilar5500\"","summary":"A vibrant new RPG world.","reviewText":"I have been playing this game on my PS3 now for more than a week now, and have been loving every moment. I feel it successfully combines the classic character building and quest aspects of an RPG with the button mashing of a fighter or a game like Fable. The thing about the mashing though is that while you can simply mash away, you can also incorporate strategy and positioning into the combat situations. When is the exact perfect moment to unleash a chain lightning spell, then close in while the enemy or enemies are stunned and finish the job? When should you blink out of danger only to immediately ambush the same critters with meteoric fire? Although you do mash buttons, the better you get at combat, the less you do so, and more you use selective mashing to accomplish fantastic things. The setting itself is vibrant, lush, and colorful, and as you travel through the various lands, the geography changes accordingly. There is forest, swamp, high desert, coastal settings, etc...The story itself is very entertaining, and the characters within are fun and cool. You definitely feel the classic Salvatore writing style in full effect here. While things play out in ways that any person can attach themselves emotionally to, things also end up larger than life.I haven't finished the game yet, but my character is level 30 at this point. I will update this as things progress, but i can say with confidence now that this is a completely engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable game, and i am loving every moment of it. So much so that i have wasted two weekends staring at my tv screen with a controller in my hands, sometimes forgetting to eat, and barely getting any sleep at all.

I play most games with the 3D off, but this game puts it to use very well, and the 3D is only extreme when it absolutely needs to be. For the most part it is very mild.But on to the real review:  as most of you should know, this game is a blend of the open range Mario games and the sidescrolling platformers.  The blend is perfect.  There are a lot of levels that tend to be fairly strictly one or the other, and a lot that have a great half n half.  Like many others have said, sometimes they feel a lot like levels out of Galaxy, but I think that each level is still something new.When you first get going the controls may take a little getting used to, if you are conditioned to SM64DS, but they aren't awkward and will become natural pretty quickly as they are mostly the same.There isn't much else I can say, other than you know what you're going to get, but you'll still be pleasantly surprised.

{"product_name":"B00AZ70ZA8","description":"Walking Dead: Survival Instinct for Wii U","reviewerName":"Derek Vazquez \"DaFynestRican\"","summary":"A decent FPS using of the Walking Dead license","reviewText":"I'll start by saying that while I am a fan of the show, I have not watched past half of season 2 ( a travesty, I know), so I am reviewing the game based on a gamers view, not as a die-hard fan. The game seem to use a similar engine to Cabela's for Wii U, which employs passable character models and backdrops. Nothing that will impress, but I suppose it isn't too ugly to look at, though up close the texture work is a bit pixelated and the animation (when attacking zombies) is stiff and at times they react awkwardly. I played with the controller pro and control was tight and for the most part responsive. There were ocassionally moments I had to press the Y button more than once to pick up an item. The Gamepad displays a handy inventory screen while you play. This is essential since Survival Instinct really is more about Survival than all-out zombie warfare. As far as sound is concerned music is mostly creepy, low instruments in the background, unless an event occurs to advance the story or you are attacked, then it swells appropriately to up the tension. It mirrors the show very well in that aspect. There is a sense of fear that creeps up when you are spotted while trying to sneak about, which for the most part you'll be doing a lot of. Overall I wouldnt say it's the best FPS game I've played, but for a game based on a TV show it tries to keep authenticity. It even has the actors reprising their roles for the voice-acted bits. I'll leave it to fans of the show to grade the story since I'm no expert in that regard. I'd say it's a solid buy for Wii U owners lookig for more Zombie fun after playing through ZombiU. Fun, but don't expect it to be up to that games calibur.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000P297E8","reviewerName":"Slyohazard","summary":"Devilicous!!","reviewText":"Three years since the release of devil may cry 3, dante is back for a new mission..Well sort of.This time you play as Nero who is the new protagonist of the DMC sequel and unlike the \"substitute\"Character of Raiden (Metal Gear Solid 2) Nero delivers almost as much as Dante especially with new capabilities one in particular would be the Devil Grabber which can extend to grab enemies and combined with the melee buster attack makes for one mean punch.The grabber is also used for reaching levels that cannot be accompanied by foot.  Reminiscent to both Capcom's Lost Planet and Bionic Commando. Once the game starts you are treated to a cool cinema in which Nero, Knight of the holy order is shown battling demons while his beloved Kylie performs an operatic song within the church. Then afterwards a mysterious assassin cloaked in red (guess who?) attacks the church and is confronted by Nero in a very John Wooesque scene.The rest of the plot follows as Nero tracks down the assassin as well as unraveling the conspiracy involving the church and in the process rescuing Kylie. The gameplay never slows down due to intense boss battles, collecting orbs to increase your skills and items and solving puzzles.My only gripe regarding this game would be some backtracking to the point in which you have to face the previous bosses, not twice but three times. And then there are the usual camera issues which can be a bit frustrating when jumping to collect orbs. Dante however has the usual guns Ebony and Ivory, but the one new weapon that stands out would be the Pandora that is capable of transforming from a arrow, to a bazooka, Gatling gun and some weird flying missile platform.I highly recommend DMC4 regardless of minor flaws, its well worth the purchase. My regret is that I did not buy the collector's edition which comes with the DMC Anime as the DVD is now out of print due to ADV restructuring. The graphics for both PS3 and 360 are somewhat similar; however I prefer the 360 version because of the force feedback, achievement points and custom soundtrack. The game's music is still reminiscent to ramenstein but with a bit of rob zombie. The ending song is pretty good and makes for a great companion to the story. Capcom, you have done it again!! Now bring on RE 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"The Last Story - The Evolution of the JRPG","reviewText":"The Last Story has finally hit the United States and I couldn't be happier. From people who worked on most notably Final Fantasy and Lost Odyssey, The Last Story is their next JRPG and first exclusive on the Wii. Regardless of the Wii's technical prowess, The Last Story does a lot more to advance JRPGs than the competition on HD platforms. It's a beautiful and stunning JRPG with some western design influences that brings the genre into 2012. Personally, I feel it's a better game than Xenoblade Chronicles, which I felt went on for way too long and the quests weren't unique or interesting enough. In addition to getting this magnificent game, you also receive an outer cardboard box that houses the game, an art book, and early buyers also receive a soundtrack. It's a gorgeous package.Graphics - This is a Wii game, so you'd assume it won't quite match games on the HD systems, which you'd be right about in some cases, but this is a gorgeous game. Characters look great and their faces animate with emotion. The environments are meticulously detailed with good looking water, beautiful architecture, etc.Story - The story of The Last Story is beautifully crafted. Unlike many other JRPGs with voice acting and character designs that can be somewhat grating on the nerves, The Last Story feels more mature in both areas. The voice acting is fantastic and very British, while the characters all look unique and are wonderfully designed. For example, Syrenne, who likes to drink and has pretty much no manners, is a nice change of pace for a JRPG.Soundtrack - It's so finely crafted. As you'd expect from Noduo Uematsu, The Last Story soundtrack is lovely.Gameplay - Maintaining most elements that make a JRPG, The Last Story adds in western influence, which benefits the game and makes it feel like an evolution for the genre. Combining a cover system with combat that you're accustomed to, The Last Story is a real treat to play. Using the cover system, you go into cover and you can pop out from cover to use ranged attacks, then you can leap over cover and use sword-focused melee combat. It all feels very seamless and fluid. While were on the topic of this game's combat, make sure you go to the options menu and change the combat style to 'Manual'.Online Deathmatch & Co-op - Somewhat strange for a game of its kind, The Last Story features network play via a 'Deathmatch' mode that has you fighting up to 6 people online, while the 'Co-op' mode allows you to join with them to defeat a boss. While the single player portion is the meat & potatoes of The Last Story, it's a nice little addition to have some online play thrown into the mix. From my experience, the online parts ran fine for me and lag-free.The Last Story is a beautiful title that defines a new era of JRPGs. Bringing together gameplay mechanics from the East and West, this game can appeal to just about anyone who likes a good RPG. Let's hope this truly isn't the last story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2012"}

The original designs and artwork were beautiful, awe-inspiring, and ambitious, but they were limited by the hardware of the PlayStation 2 and the fact that at the time, most people didn't have high-definition flat-panel TVs.  These games play exactly the same as they did on their older cousin the PS2, but for the PS3 we now have the capability of rending everything sharper and at higher resolutions.  The PS3's hardware doesn't have a hard time keeping it at a rock-solid 60fps, either, making for a very clean picture.In God of War I and II, you play Kratos, a mortal warrior of Sparta who made a deal with the Gods (of Olympus).  It all went horribly wrong, and the further Kratos goes seeking revenge, the more massive his quest becomes.  Kratos uses various weapons to accomplish his goals: as you uncover them throughout the game, you can not only choose when you wish to use a particular weapon, you also collect power orbs that allow you to make choices about how to 'level up' a weapon's capabilities.  Attacking your opponents is broken down into \"light\" (but fast) attacks, \"heavy\" (but slower) attacks, and the various ways you can combine them with jumps or other button presses.  Kratos can also use magic, grapple his opponents for specific combos, and gets opportunites to do serious amounts of damage or detailed finishing moves.  The action takes place in a variety of locations, including while scaling walls, climbing ropes, and more.  The God of War series is an action game that is rated 'M' for violence, gore, and some sexual situations and content.As an added bonus, this collection has online \"trophies\":  little achievements you can earn as you play.  It has all the extras my original copies of the God of War series had, only you don't have to beat the game(s) to see them:  they're right there on the menu.If you remember the original God of War games, the price makes this a worthwhile way to relive the fun, more vivid than ever, on the PS3.  If you're new to the series, you won't miss anything from the originals:  it's all here.  You'll see why this was such a successful franchise, and why God of War III was so highly anticipated.  It's a shame most PS3 units are not backwards-compatible, but this is one title that makes up for it well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2010"}

Well, if you mind it being translucent, keep moving, but other than that, this is a great controller.Let's get this out of the way - the translucent case is cool, the lights, not so much. The nice thing is, you can turn the lights off or set them to pulse only when the controller vibrates. If you couldn't turn this off, it would be a definite skip as in darker rooms the flashing or pulsing is really distracting.The cable from the controller is 3m or about 10 ft long. You should be able to sit comfortably on the couch with this when plugged in. Another reason I like the controller is the quick release. So if your dog runs through the living, your cat, your children or you wife/husband and they trip on the cord, it should quick release and not pull your controller, or more importantly, your Xbox 360, across the room.The analog sticks are smooth and work well. The cross pad works OK for fighting games, but isn't perfect.Overall, a great controller at a good price compared to the first party controller, and this is also fully Microsoft licensed.Highly recommended if you don't mind translucent and the possibility of flashing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Valve Does It Again","reviewText":"After the overwhelmingly positive reviews from the mini game within the Orange Box, Valve decided to revisit the world of Aperture Industries. It has all the old things that were great about the first game and quite a few new inventions which allow for some pretty creative gaming. Valve essentially created a new genre - what I'd consider a first person puzzle game. For those unfamiliar with Portal, you carry around this gun that makes holes in walls (two at a time - max) and you can walk through instantly ending up at the opposite portal.Pros-Full length single player game lasting 10-12 hours (longer depending on level of experience)-Co-op play adds even more gameplay and a totally different set of puzzles-Story has considerably more depth and plenty of humor-Large deviation from the common game type-Plenty of new inventions give constant gameplay varianceCons-After beating single player and co-op, replay is kind of pointless-Graphics engine looks basically the same-Only a few really hard puzzles-Needs tips or a tutorial mode for beginnersGameplay 9 of 10Portal 2 is similar to Portal in that you carry around the Portal gun and solve puzzles. But that's where the similarity ends. I'd say there are somewhere around 40-50 total testing rooms / \"obstacle areas.\" Not all are legitimate testing rooms. The old things like the boxes are back, but as opposed to the balls of light that would bounce everywhere and potentially kill you; they've replaced those with laser beams. Along with the lasers are reflective boxes which can be used to redirect the beams. And there are hard light bridges which can be walked on and sent through portals to move about a room. These add-ons occur in the earlier parts of the game.Later on you'll find yourself in the bowels of Aperture's testing facility attempting to return to the surface. I won't give too much away here, but some of the new elements are the repulsion gel, speed gel (don't know the actual name) and the conversion gel. The repulsion gel acts like Flubber. It makes you bounce and you can imagine the uses for this. Speed gel basically makes you move about 3-5 times as fast when you walk over it. This has a multiplicative effect meaning the longer you run on it, the faster you'll move. Conversion gel is the weird one, which allows you to turn any flat surface into a portal. The final addition is a beam which holds you in mid-air but only allows movement one direction and can be sent through portals.The puzzles are in general far larger and in later cases far more elaborate. Some of them are difficult at first, but once you've understood the principles everything is easier. And that's the only thing in the gameplay that I was peeved with. I only really struggled with two or three of the all the puzzles. I would have liked a replay where the puzzles added another degree of difficulty or like a timer maybe. On the other hand, I think a person who'd never touched Portal would have a really hard time understanding what to do. There should be tips given as a toggle option.Co-op 8 of 10I couldn't believe it, but the co-op game is an entirely different set of puzzles and is of course more difficult as many times you have to use all four portals. You're given control of a robot, blue or orange and you have the ability to tell your partner a location to go to or give a countdown. You can also dance, play: rock, paper, scissors, high five and wave all while interacting with your partner. What's nice is you can play co-op online with friends or even another random Portal 2 player. I'm not sure how long the co-op game length is, but would probably be similar to the single player campaign.Story 8 of 10You're awoken some years(?) later after you've defeated the AI running the place who's named GlaDOS. If you don't get the pun, it's ok. It's an `80s thing. Anyways, you're essentially trying to escape with Wheatley who is another AI. He's not exactly an AI, more like an artificial personality. And by the way, he provides almost all the humor in the game. He was voiced by Stephen Merchant who did a wonderful job and gave a very human quality to the game. If you don't want spoilers I wouldn't read any more of the story section.While trying to get out of this facility Wheatley accidentally turns GlaDOS back on. Some rather ridiculous events ensue and you end up at the bottom of the salt mine in which Aperture started. I really enjoyed this part of the game, getting to see the progression of the story and gradually make my way back to the surface. It turns out that a man named Cave Johnson started Aperture in 1952. As you navigate the puzzles you'll also notice how things changed at Aperture as the decades passed. It's a solid storyline for a game and a really impressive one for a puzzle game.Graphics 7 of 10Visuals in Portal 2 are really solid, but don't take a big leap from Portal and that was four years ago. The rooms are expansive and visual impressive, but the details are not unbelievable. Though in a game like this, you're not going to sit there and stare at the metal structure to see the grain in the rivets. None of this takes anything away from the game however and the graphics are easily contemporary to most current games.Replay Value 5 of 10It's unfortunate there are no other ways to play the puzzles, because if there were I would have given this game five stars. But once you played through the single player and co-op - that's it. You could play again, but you know all the tricks and remember how to solve most of the puzzles already. It is still a very good game that I'd recommend to just about anyone. But I'd say this is a must rent at least for someone new to the franchise and a must buy for Portal gamers. It's an easy 8 out of 10 for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Mixed Thoughts for the PC Version","reviewText":"Note that I only did play the demo available from Origin. It consisted of the obligatory 30 minute tutorial with a 45 minute trial of the open world section. I did this twice with characters focusing on magic casting and roguish abilities. So I got to do a good small chunk to what I've read about in Kingdoms of Alamur: Reckoning. First of all, I'm not going to be the strange one and just give a 1 star rating because it has to use Origin. That's just silly to hate something completely because of one service, no matter how screwed up that service can be (shakes fist at EA). But unfortunately, this is one of the downsides of purchasing any EA product on PC now.KOA:Reckoning should be called Kingdoms of Amalgamation, because that is what it does exactly. It literally has game play elements from various video games that are in today's market. The multi-enemy melee combat is very reminiscent of God of War even with the visual button mashing quick time events. Animations like melee and magic were fluid with awesome flourishes. The character to NPC conversation mirrors Bioware titles like Knights of the Old Republic and, of course, Mass Effect. I liked how you can get to the point with conversations, but noticed that some mouth movement did lag a few times. Not a big problem though. I mean it's a big game with lots of quest content anyway. The graphical environments and character animations scream out as one reviewer accurately stated: \"bastard child of World of Warcraft and Fable.\" I scoffed a little at some of the rough cartoonish textures in the tutorial, but then was immediately jealous of how the open world looked. I personally wish this was WoW's current graphics and also used some animations from KOA: Reckoning, especially since WoW is still looking like it did 7 years ago.I have two main peeves about KOA: Reckoning that just pretty much irritated me playing the PC version:Well, for a game claiming to have a huge open world it's really annoying that you can't simply jump. Strange, I know, But the fact is when playing a game this huge it would be nice to be able to fully explore the lush and enticing environments. I felt very constricted being not able to at least jump onto a ledge like how I've been spoiled with WoW and the past three Elder Scrolls games. For combat's sake it would be nice to at least jump a bit like Kratos in God of War to evade attacks.  It's also annoying when you want to see beautiful aquatic areas like waterfalls or ponds and your instinct is to jump in, then swim to the other side of something. Nope, you have to find the right ledge or decline path to enter any water. Fable was notorious for this game design and it drove me nuts. So immediately thinking that the space bar was for jumping around,it's instead just for used for evading in combat and rolling like an idiot in any third person Legend of Zelda game.My second peeve about the PC version are the controls. This game was obviously designed for console controllers because using the mouse and keyboard setup was awkward. Looking around in the game is constricted and when in combat, the view switches to a zoomed up view where you can move or aim at any target, but it  uses an auto aim feature. I checked the options for this demo and saw nothing where it was adaptable for using a game controller like Skyrim or Mass Effect 3.So after playing the PC version demo, I decided that this game would be better for the X-Box 360 or PlayStation 3. On the good side, you won't have to deal with Origin this way...hopefully. I personally wouldn't buy this version on Amazon or Steam even if it was on sale. I think that it would be a good console RPG to play since it did look very interesting enough to waste 100 hours on from what I read.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0047ODJAI","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Perhaps my #1 favorite franchise these days","reviewText":"Dead Space 1 came out of nowhere two years ago and just knocked me flat on my ass. I had no idea EA was capable of such AAA quality. I've been a survival horror fan since Resident Evil kicked off the genre in 1996 but had lost all enthusiasm after RE and Silent Hill both jumped the shark about 5-6 years ago. Dead Space isn't quite \"classic\" survival horror, as it also has a fair bit of action-adventure and shooter spliced into its DNA. But these days, it's the closest thing we've got. Resident Evil was the \"Night of the Living Dead\"/George Romero verison. Silent Hill was the \"supernatural\"/Stephen King version. With Dead Space, at last we finally have the \"Alien\"/Ridley Scott version of survival horror. One of the things I loved most about DS1 was that in some ways it stuck closer to the traditions and spirit of the classic RE games than RE4 or 5 ever did. One of the things I'm loving about DS2 is that it adds some elements that push in the Silent Hill direction; e.g. psychological dementia, exploring deserted apartments and a surreal elementary school (in outer space!) feelings of guilt vis as vis a dead lover, etc. Above all, like DS1, DS2 spews AAA quality from every orifice. It's simply a stupendously well designed and executed video game. It has incredible atmosphere and mood, tension, action... I had extremely high expectations for DS2, and it has delivered. This is the kind of game that makes we want to stop and write a letter to the development team to tell them they've made something they should be very proud of and kudos for having so many obviously talented people under one roof. I'd like to buy them all a beer.EDIT: Dead Space 2 has some pretty freaking annoying bugs in it, primarily to do with purchased items disappearing from your inventory. I contacted the DS2 lead programmer and asked him when they would patch it, and his response lead me to believe they're not even going to bother. As much as I love Dead Space and the team that made it, I'm sorry, but that's bull @#$%. My rating just dropped two stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

Lerch","summary":"Like Gears 3 Arcade Mode in Campaign, Multiplayer greatness","reviewText":"I was hoping for an epic release in the same vein as Gears 3, just like everyone else. What People Can Fly handed us, under Epic's watchful eye, is more like Gears 3 Arcade Mode taking over campaign.The quick review is, if you're looking for more of Gears 3 campaign, be prepared for disappointment. If you are looking for a fun, fast, frantic game with lots of violence and an OK story, it's worth it. If you want Beast vs Horde, pick this up and play OverRun. It's not exactly Beast vs Horde, but it's close. And then there are most of the fun multiplayer modes we had in Gears 3 making a return here as well.Recommended.The longer review:The story goes that Kilo Squad, headed by Lieutenant Baird, are being put on trial. For what, we don't know, other than Loomis is afraid he'll become a \"hero.\" The team is to be court martialed for whatever it was the did.Graphics:Just as amazing as Gears 3. The XBox (and PS3) are well known to game makers and they are able to wring every last piece of power out of these systems these days.No screen tearing. No odd graphical blips. Just the same fantastic artwork and style you are accustomed to with Gears.People Can Fly haven't pulled off anything graphically we haven't seen already, but that's not to say it doesn't look really, really good.Music:Gone is the orchestral soundtrack of Gears 3, replaced instead by another Steve Joblonski soundtrack that focuses on speed and a frantic nature to pull it through. This feels more like a game soundtrack than a movie soundtrack (which is what I would kind of say Gears 3 OST was). More guitars and a much faster pace. It matches the pace of the onscreen action quite well.Game Play:Campaign- the best I can describe this is Gears 3 in permanent Arcade mode. The story still progresses as you would expect, but each \"section\" is split off from one another by a kill count/status update screen. Each character in Kilo gets a chance to relate a piece of the story. During the story telling, there are Crimson Omens near the beginning of the section that allow you to make the section a little more difficult and earn your stars more quickly. What are stars used for you might ask, then? Stars are used to open up unlocks, such as weapon skins, characters and so on. It is also used to open up Aftermath (which we'll get to in a minute). Depending on how well you do in a section, you will earn up to three stars. 3 stars is the goal and if you don't enable the Declassification modifier, you can still potentially earn all the stars but it will take much longer.The thing I've noticed that I'm not overly fond of is the way each section plays out. Because of the split and stop in the action, I feel like I'm being removed from the game and action. In Gears 3, story mode just flowed and didn't have these jarring breaks. When you played it in Arcade mode it did, but that wasn't the point. Now this IS the point and while the story is still told, the break in action can be jarring. I feel like I'm not as connected to the story this time around.Aftermath is a short gameplay section, opened with 40+ stars, and is used to show what happens in the \"aftermath\" of Halvo Bay, starring Baird and Cole. It plays out alongside what happens in Gears 3 and Baird and Cole revisit Halvo.OverRun- this is a lot of fun. One set of people take COG and the other, the Locust. The Locust have mission objectives to complete to destroy the COG while the COG are protecting these fortifications. The action for the COG is class based, with each person on the team taking a different \"job.\" Medics heal, scouts scout and so on. Very fun.Survivor- this is the replacement for Horde mode. You play the COG (with the classes in place) and are supposed to just protect an objective while the Horde is constantly streaming in to defeat you. It's different, but the same and I think it makes it a little more interesting.Team Death Match - same as the old basically. Which is NOT a bad thing.Domination - this is like capture the flag, but with 3 flags and instead of grabbing a flag and running to your base, you stand in the ring. Wait, so I guess it's not really that much like capture the flag... Whichever team captures the rings longest, wins the match/round.CHANGES TO THE GAME:You can now throw grenades without having to equip them. This uses the RB button. The grenade is also stick, so if you manage to hit someone with it when it bounces, it sticks to them.You can only carry 2 weapons at a time. You now switch weapons with the Y button now. This takes some getting used to, as you are accustomed to using the cross pad (which made sense when you had \"4\" weapons)The \"LOOK\" button is now up on the control pad.The button you press to get intel on the mission and figure out where your teammates is now down on the control pad. Since RB is taken by, you know, grenades.Enemies seem to move a LOT faster. The lumbering Locust just seem to move maybe 10-20% faster than they did in Gears 3. This gives the game a frantic feel, more visceral and in your face.EXTRAS:Depending on where/if you preordered, you got a different character skin. I hate this, but it's the way of life for gamers these days.Also included with every game is a \"free\" copy of Gears of War (original) via download from XBox Live. I don't know. This feels like a sort of an apology to players, like \"hey, we know the game isn't the greatest, but we give you a $20 game for free to make up for it.\" Just drop the MSRP of the game to $50 then. Most of the people who buy Judgment most likely will have already played Gears of War, though for those that haven't, this extra might open the Gears universe to you.Overall:Gears of War: Judgment tries to set the Gears 3 bar higher. I don't feel like they've accomplished this goal, but they have given us a solid game. New multiplayer modes are fun and worth playing. The Campaign feels a little disjointed but is well written.Pros-Good graphicsGood musicGood storyMutiplayer is super funChanges up some of the tried and true Gears gameplayCons:Changes up some of the tried and true Gears gameplay (yeah, it's good and bad)The story feels disjointed at times in Campaign\"Sections\" feel just like that, sections. Adds to disjointed nature of the Campaign storyCan only carry 2 weapons at a time (OK, 3, as you can carry 2+ grenades)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

In my opinion that was one of the better games of the past year.  The only problem I had with that game was the lack of characters from the television show, so naturally when I heard of the new Walking Dead game, I couldn't wait!  Well....I should have. Darryl and Merle are two of the most popular characters on the show, so this was going to be a slam dunk right? Wrong!  Here's the problems I have with this game.....1. This game is an obvious attempt to cash in on Dead Island's success.  The same sort of game play, clumsy weapons that do barely damage, lack of ammo, and a lot of time passing between missions and levels.2. ONE game save slot! The reason I quit playing this game is when you save it, the next time you turn it back on, you are way behind where you actually were, so you find yourself playing the same (long) levels several times.3. BORING. Sorry guys, this game lacks much action, It may actually put you to sleep. I know I have fell asleep playing this game.  The story sucks so bad, which doesn't help.4. BORING! oh yeah already mentioned that!5. mediocre graphics and horrible controls.  This is 2013, yet I have seen better 360 graphics in 2007.  The horrible controls make this game unplayable.  When a zombie attacks you you have to maneuver R-stick just right to kill a zombie, or sneak up behind a zombie, press RB to execute, which doesn't always work.6. Lack of character story.  This is the Walking Dead, one of the greatest character driven television shows of all time. You think that the game would involve more story and add something to already established characters, but nope! They were working with Darryl and Merle, two of the greatest characters of the greatest character driven show ever and they still couldn't do it.So if you are thinking of buying this game, do yourself a favor, go to your nearest Redbox, shell out $2 and rent this game before you buy it, because that $2 may actually save you $40+ and a whole bunch of disappointment in the long run.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Bench Pressing for your Brain","reviewText":"Brain Age is a game that defies its reviews. The game has been getting pretty good numbers but not spectacular. On the other hand, as of May 2nd, Brain Age was the number one selling video game on Amazon across all platforms. My suspicion is that Brain Age will be remembered long into the future for ushering in a new genre of video game in the U.S. This may well be to brain exercise games what Street Fighter was to fighting games, Goldeneye was to first person shooters and Tetris was to puzzle games. It also may elevate neurologists to pop star status. Or maybe not.The point of Brain Age is to exercise your brain just as you might exercise your body. Instead of reducing your heart rate or blood pressure the player (is that the correct word) will aim for a brain age of 20. Each day Brain Age puts the player through a series of exercises that take only a few minutes. The Brain Age is then tracked on a graph to show improvement or regression. You can also compare graphs of multiple players.Brain Age is the only game I have ever seen that is played sideways. In other words you hold it open like you might hold open a book. For left handed players the system can be rotated 180 degrees. All the work is done with the stylus and mic. It took me a little practice to get the writing down. For instance I generally draw a 4 with two motions but the DS seems to require one continuous motion without lifting the stylus. Other people who have played on my system have had problems with 1's coming out as 2's. Letters are even spottier. The word recognition seems to work very well but occasionally misunderstands me.I must admit that I have a handful of issues with the game. First of all the Brain Age scoring seems inconsistent. I've seen some record breaking testing runs get mediocre scores and some average runs get great scores. I swear that I did far better when I earned a 27 than a run where I earned a 22. Some of the tests can be rather annoying, in particular counting from 1 to 120 as fast as you can. My last issue is with the dialog from the game version of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. After a few weeks of listening to the same phrases over and over again you will want to test the structural integrity of Dr. Kawashima's cranium... with your fists.In the end the worthwhile ness of Brain Age hinges on whether it actually does what it claims to do which is increase memory and improve the functioning of the prefrontal cortex. I must confess that I have my doubts. It reminds me of  people who practice IQ tests and believe their IQ's are going up. The first time I tried `Head Count' I managed a perfect score. My score on `Low to High' has remained fairly steady while I've seen a slow improvement in `Calculations'. However I would attribute most of my success in `Calculations' to improving my ability to draw legible numbers and refreshing my speed at the times tables.If brain testing isn't your thing Brain Age also comes with over 100 Sukoku puzzles that practically make the game worth the twenty dollar cost all by themselves. I look forward to trying some of the other brain games that are scheduled to come out this year because I must admit that the 10 or brain tests on Brain Age are starting to test my patience more than my cerebral cortex.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"T Schneid","summary":"Super Smash Bros.

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"As Good as it Gets","reviewText":"If you're a fan of the original Star Fox 64, you're going to be delighted from the moment the black starfield pops out at you in 3D on the opening screen.  This is a direct port of the Nintendo 64 game, with the added bonus that you have more control over mission selection as you play through and--most importantly--you can now fly the ship by tilting the 3DS.  The 'tilt steering' was the most enjoyable aspect to me, and I suspect it might be why I found the game easier to play than some of my fellow reviewers:  flight felt more intuitive this way for me then it did using the circle pad.If you're new to Star Fox, This will probably be your best introduction to the game, but you'll need to be a bit forgiving.  The single-player campaign can be played all the way through in less than two hours. The idea is that you unlock additional levels for play-through on the next go-round.  The graphics have been slightly improved but because they hearken back to the days of the 16-bit SuperNintendo, they're not going to knock your eyes out as much as the 3D effects will.Star Fox is a spaceship shooter a la Star Wars whose main characters are cartoon animals.  You fly main character Fox McCloud's spaceship (and in one level, you pilot a tank) through various places, fighting the occasional end boss, leading up to the big baddie behind it all.  At its simplest, it is a series of missions that involve you flying around dodging objects, shooting everything, and bailing out your team members when they get in trouble.  Children will enjoy the story, but adults might get a little tired of constantly having to bail out their animal friends.  Balancing my mission goals with the frequent cries of, \"He's on my tail!  I can't shake him!\", at times I was rolling my eyes and thinking, \"Gee Slippy, you'll probably hit more of them if you try flying backwards.\"Still, gameplay is fun.  It's short the first time around, but I dove right back in and played a couple more times through, unlocking side missions and looking for more.  The nature of a short campaign probably fits well with the 3DS hardware, as Nintendo urges you (and the game reminds you) to play in short stints and take breaks \"even if you don't think you need to\".  I found the difficulty to be fairly easy, but Your Mileage May Vary:  there are some people who really struggled, so don't be surprised if you find yourself having to work at it a bit.Overall, it's nice to see the series still going on.  I would have liked a bit more content to the game, but Star Fox 64 3D does deliver that same fun style of play that its predecessors did--and makes it better with the tilt piloting and rich 3D effects.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}

I liked rpg style games, but I'm kind of sick of the fantasy rpg's. If you are sick of the fantasy story lines then buy this game. This game has an EXTREMELY good story. There were times when I was playing a quest and I just wanted to give the writers a hug for being that darn good at story telling. The investigation missions are very challenging and sometimes I had to look up the cheat and I never felt bad because I would have never figured it out. I have friends that have played all the missions with no help at all though. So it's doable. I would say this game generally attracts and keeps the more mature players playing. Most of the cabal that I have joined are mothers, fathers and well into 30s and 40s of age. This is a good thing though. It makes the chat channels less cluttered with children being immature. The leveling system is different. You don't level. You get experience, but they get you your stat and ability points. Stat points will get you into better gear, and ability points will get you new abilities.I saw a bunch of reviews where people said that the game doesn't give any instructions on how to play. This is entirely not true. Most of the missions have a quest helper tool that will even show you where you need to go. The NPCs on the game will send you on missions that will get you to the next NPC areas as well.And here is the cool thing about missions. There isn't so many boring fetch quests that plague most MMOs. You know like, &#34;Go kill 10 bears and 15 hides.&#34; There are some missions like that, but they are not common place in this game. These are the green colored quests and the completionist in me tried to do them all while playing through, but I found myself just doing the main story missions with the cut scenes because they are so much more fun to play!There are instances in this game and different difficulties. Normal, Elite, and Nightmare. You will notice that the instances do not have very many mobs in between bosses. Some of them have 0 trash mobs. I was a little bit dissapointed with that, until I got to fight the bosses on Elite and Nightmare difficulties as they become challenging with boss mechanics that you have to be mindful of, attacks that need to be impaired. Needless to say tanking in this game is by far the most challenging. The instances do follow the trilogy of a dps, tank and healer roles but you dont have to stick with that role completely. I have builds where I am a leech healer, so I dps and am the main healer. I have a tank/dps build where I am super squishy, but deal pretty respectful dps compared to the actual dps. As a dps you can do raw damage, sometimes you need to help the tank impair boss attacks that will wipe the whole party.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2014"}

Normally the cheapest PS3 is the 12gig model , which sells for about 230 normally. And to be honest, the 12gig model is atrocious. The whole appeal of the PS3 is PS+ and a hard drive, They give you so many free games with PS+ that you'd be crazy to only have a 12 gig HD. That's why this bundle is so amazing. One astoundingly great game (TLOU) and one OK game (Sorry Batman, but the other two were much better).There are minuses associated with this model of PS3. As others have noted, it feels cheap. Gone is the slot-loading internal drive. They replaced it with a cheap plastic sliding door, which while bad isn't the worst problem. The worst problem is that by putting it outside of the console(it's on top of the console btw) it makes a lot of noise when it spins. But this is where PS+ and the HD make a world of difference. The console is silent when playing games off the HD. I recommend it for PS+ and downloadable games. Otherwise I'd say try to find the previous slim model. That one is silent both playing off disc and not.Also the games come in sleeves. Not a big deal honestly. So what? I guess if you're a collector is matters, but otherwise it's just a means for holding the games when not being played.Only other complaint I have is personal opinion - I hate the controller. I've been using the new PS4 for about 2 months now so going to the Dual Shock 3 after using the 4 is like night and day. It's not a terrible controller, but it's clearly inferior. Don't let that opinion sway you from getting the PS3. Huge library of exclusives that often come packaged together cheaply (God of War, inFAMOUS, Uncharted, Resistance, Jak and Daxter etc).

It was clearly rushed to market and is not nearly as polished as the previous games have been.  It was like pulling teeth getting myself to play though this thing.Here's a list of my complaints:--The game is buggy.  I got stuck in a weapons upgrade menu and couldn't get out!  (BTW does anyone comprehend the upgrade system in this game??  It made zero sense to me...insanely stupid, bizarre & nonsensical).  I also got stuck in a weapons trial & had to quit the game and reload it!  Again, it's obvious this thing was rushed to market.--The graphics are glitchy.  Polygons pop in & out constantly.  That didn't even happen on the PS2 R&C; games.--The camera in this game sucks.  It doesn't recenter itself after you move it, so you end up constantly having to fight with it.  Cheap deaths will result.  There's also so much 'foliage' and other little details in this game that end up getting in the way of the camera & obstructing your view.--Too many little nooks & crannies (especially in the first few stages) where Ratchet gets stuck.--The initial 'gravity' stages are disorienting much of the time.  In fact I found myself disoriented through much of this game.--No customizable controls (I'm accustomed to using the O button for firing like in previous R&C; games, but that's not an option here so I was hitting the wrong button CONSTANTLY throughout the game).--Quick-selecting weapons does NOT work properly & you often end up having to fight with the analog stick & quick-select menu to get it to highlight the correct weapon.--Some of the sound effects are downright obnoxious (like the pause sound).--It's simply not fun.  I'm glad I only paid twenty bones for it (Black Friday sale) and was able to unload it on someone else for the same price I bought it for.  This one's a dog.  Glad it's over.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006FDLP","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"not too impressed with this game.","reviewText":"Visually Mortal Kombat: DA is one of the best looking fighting games I have seen on any console, only falling in a close second behind Dead of Alive 3 on the XBOX.  The only thing I did not like about the graphics are some of the characters.  They are WAY WAY out of proportion and look very unrealistic, This is very noticable in the women characters.One good thing is this game is that the menus in the game are spectacular; the game starts in a hallway and depending on what game mode you choose the screen pans as you are walking down the hall into different rooms.The sound in the game is pretty good but nothing spectacular.  Here is where the game starts to go downhill.First of all Midway has changed the fighting system which is a good idea, but it needs alot more work.  Each character has 3 different fighting styles you can choose from during the match.  Each fighting style has different moves and different button combinations.  The first two fighting styles are basically two forms of martial art and the last fighting style is your character with a weapon.  While this is a good idea it makes the game very cumbersome, I am sure it would take some getting used to, so this may not bother you.  However one thing I really did not like is the actual game play and feel of the game.  To me the characters seem slow to respond to your commands and in the meantime get pummeled by his/her opponent.  Even after you perform the correct button combinations for a special move, your character seems to wait a split second to actually do the move, which can get very frustrating; especially against an opponent who only does the same \"cheese\" move for the entire match.The same holds true for the \"monster\"(ie, GORO, MOTARO) opponent near the end of the game.  He has this move in which he sucks you towards his mouth and hits you while you're in the air.  This brings me to another point, MK:DA seems to have move cheap moves resulting in cheesy wins; especially with the weapon.  I never did enjoy the weapons aspect even when it was in MK4, and I feel that they need to be removed.Another disappointing thing is that each character now only has one fatality, which gets old pretty fast.  You would think on a powerful system like the XBOX, Midway would have been able to get in at least 3 fatalities per character, but instead they settled with one.Finally, one thing I did not enjoy about the game is having to unlock most of the characters.  You start of with 12 some totally new and some old ones that we know. But you can get the others by gaining various coins and going down to the crypt to \"buy\" them.  Basically for every computer player you beat during story mode you get X amount of coins.  Those coins add up and you can then go into the games \"crypt\" and open one of the 676 various coffins for a various amount of money.  The catch is you have no idea what is in the coffin until you actually open it.  Most of the coffins contain artwork, other coins, and some are even empty.  There are about 20 or so coffins that contain new boards and characters but they are very expensive.  For example to get Raiden, you need 3300 gold coins!  Let me put this in perspective; if you beat the game with a character you may only get at most 150 gold coins.  Most coins you get are ruby and graphite coins, which are not that valuable.  Needless to say you will be playing for a long time just to get one new character.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, if you don't mind playing the game over and over again but for me, I would rather have all characters available or at least not so expensive to get.Aside from the character situation I found this game to be quite boring.  To me it seemed rushed in my opinion, it has so many aspects to be the best fighting game on XBOX, but it has fallen short.  I was expecting at least 3 fatalities per character, but there is only one.  Also the fact that you have to \"buy\" new characters is kind of disappointing.  Even if there were a code to get the characters I probably still would not buy the game because it gets boring so fast.This game is not for everyone and my suggestion is the rent this game before you buy it.  Which is what I did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

Oyez, oyez, oyez, all you programmers, voice actors, testers, customer support reps, writers, and investors:  you deserve this.  You deserve to lose your investment.

This went on for nearly THREE MONTHS, kiddies, with all sorts of back and forth between me and the company before I (helpless, doddering I) finally tumbled to what was going on.  This, for example, is from EA's missive in which their technical support representatives finally throw up their hands in despair:\"Greetings, Thank you for contacting Electronic Arts.  Sorry for the delay. I was out of the office and it slipped my mind to assign the case to another agent.  As for the next step I am not entirely sure what the cause is, so it is hard to determine a solution.\"Wanna know what the problem was?  Simply this:  this video game needs to connect to the manufacturer's central server to activate.  So far, so good.  But, incredibly, THIS VIDEO GAME IS INCAPABLE OF DETECTING OR BEING CONFIGURED FOR A PROXY SERVER.  Simple as that.  Even after several patches.  So if you connect to the Internet through a proxy, as many people, say in businesses and apartment complexes are forced to do, you simply can't play it, and the bumbling reps at EA's technical support will never be able to figure out why, even if given months.In the end, I did get it to work, owing to my piecing together others' postings on the Internet and learning how to bypass my proxy.

This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"A Motorized Descent into Hell","reviewText":"What took me so long?  I held off purchasing Twisted Metal: Black because I was not convinced that the game was as good as everyone had been saying.I love being wrong.This is one of the rare times when a game is actually BETTER than advertised.  TM:B drops you headlong into a surreal world of murder, betrayal, and insanity.  This isn't a game for the kids, folks.  Incog Inc. has cited being influenced by the films Seven, Jacob's Ladder and The Silence of the Lambs when making TM:B - this should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect here.  The characters you meet during your journey aren't the type to bring home to Mother, to put it mildly.  The game oozes oppressive dread, whether you're charging about laying waste to the countryside or hunting your prey through the bowels of a giant ship.  I'm a huge fan of the horror genre in music, film, books, and gaming, and I've never played a game that got so deep under my skin so quickly.  The atmosphere is a work of dark genius, from the oily storm clouds churning overhead to the tortured screams of burning victims.Luckily for game freaks, Black has more than enough gameplay to back up the seedy supernatural setting.  Choose one of several vehicles, each with its own grotesque driver, and you're on your way, whether it be through well-written but extremely graphic Story Mode, Endurance Mode (how many can you kill before dying yourself?) or Challenge (You vs. Them in a single arena).  The vast environments are nothing short of incredible, and vary from a drive-in movie theater to a downtown area with pedestrians and skyscrapers, to an obstacle-choked junkyard and a freeway (complete with fully destructible commuter traffic).  Each heavily armed vehicle is unique, and handles differently.  Each also has its own Special Attack, some of which will make you squirm with delight (especially Preacher's).  Scattered about each area are weapons pick-ups, health boosts, and repair stations.  Those who pay attention will see real-time changes to your vehicle as you select different weapons.  In addition, several arenas have environmental attacks, which range from shooting down a circling airliner to causing a giant Ferris wheel to careen through the landscape.  Vehicles are also equipped with energy moves (which are inputted much like simple fighting game maneuvers) and a turbo gauge.  The controls are a bit overwhelming at first, but after a few minutes they become second nature.  Although the game is not easy, it ramps the difficulty up superbly, causing you to become quite adept in order to proceed.  It's awesome stuff, and there are a large number of secrets to uncover as you speed about, trying to survive. If you're lucky enough to have a few like-minded friends, there are several multiplayer modes which are more than adequate, and there are even certain arenas that are accessible only in multiplayer.I pay close attention to atmosphere in gaming, and TM:B has the most effective, darkest atmosphere I've ever encountered, its sense of dread surpassing even Silent Hill's.  It doesn't jump in your face screaming, but sneaks into your head with slow, deliberate menace.  The increased processing power of the new consoles has freed developers to create utterly convincing atmosphere along with gameplay, and TM:B is a work of art on both levels.  Simply put, it's one of the best games I'll ever play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2001"}

Sometimes the next game in a series could be better than the great first one, or could be so bad that its the last game made into the series. I have gotta try it!! So i did and it wasnt the best FPS shooter i have played but it was far from bad. The graphics have increased so much since the first one but it still wasnt no halo. Anyway, to the game. Alright, i recently re-beat this game a few months ago and i have noticed of how much easier it was than Final Fronts but still was hard. I died an average of three to five times on each mission depending which one it is. I loved how if you die, you just start from the last checkpoint but sometimes that game very frustrating because of how hard it was to get to the next one. You are so close to beating the mission or next checkpoint then you die, i get mad and dont wanna re play it for the tenth time. The missions take place at different places. Desert, city, up in the sky (airplane), on a beach, trenches, and im pretty sure at a farm. Same as most WW2 games. The voice and sound fx sound pretty good also for an older game. One thing that got on my nerves was your guy wont pick up health unless you hit X or one shot from a pistol from dying. This can get very hard to pick up because you go over it too fast then you have to walk around in circles to find it again while getting shot at. The weapon change control was also a hassle getting used to but you will after awhile. In the campaign you stick with your squad the whole time, most of them die though. At the begining it shows you getting shot and almost dying in a shootout but then you like go to the day you join the army and thats how the story begins. If you have the collecters edition, you can do more things online and look at more bonus features. At the main menu, you can watch videos, look at game art, look at weapons, people with descriptions, and vechiles. Its pretty cool but you cant view them all without getting further or beating the campaign. The online is pretty awesome. You can go to more places that you dont reconize in the campaign so its new to you, chose your gear, and so on.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"This Was Great... Before the Wii U Came Out","reviewText":"The Wii was Nintendo's seventh generation console that was the competitor of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. With the next generation just now releasing, people are probably asking the question &#34;Is the Wii worth anything now?&#34;Well, I hate to break it to you, but now that the Wii U is out, it's not really. Like my other console reviews, I'll look at the Wii systematically.1. HardwareThe Nintendo Wii, though not as powerful as the PS3 or 360, was the most revolutionary of the last generation. The ability to use motion controls was very cool, even if some third-party developers abused this ability. It became even better when Nintendo released the Wii Motion Plus, which allowed for more accuracy in the motions. Other neat features include Miis (virtual characters that are used in games such as Wii Sports) and the Virtual Console (downloadable re-releases of classic games). Unfortunately, the Wii doesn't have downloadable content or very good online functionality. Also, the system doesn't come with a charger for your remotes (which would be very useful). Still, hardware-wise, it's a pretty big improvement over any sixth-generation game console.2. GraphicsPeople were disappointed when Nintendo revealed that the Wii wasn't in HD. When comparing most Wii games to most PS3 or 360 games, you can see why. Obviously, being in 480p as opposed to 1080p, it would be harder to make a game look good on the Wii as opposed to the other systems. However, games like Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Colors, and Super Smash Bros. Brawl show that the Wii can have some pretty great graphics and that HD wasn't exactly necessary. Like I said though, the graphics generally aren't very good, even though Nintendo proves time and time again that they can be pretty great.3. PowerThe Wii's power is about the same as a sixth-generation console, aside from the fact that it can hold downloaded games and things of that nature. Like the graphics, Nintendo shows that it's not necessarily a bad thing. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was packed with more content than most of the PS3 or 360 games I've played.4. GamesClearly, Nintendo makes some of the best games. Looking at their score averages, you can see that most of the time, their games are in the 8's to 9's out of 10. However, aside from companies like SEGA (who gave us the awesome Sonic Colors), the Wii had very little third-party support. There was also a lacking of mature games. Most were aimed for kids. Since I can't play very many T or M games, that's not a bad thing to me. However, I can see why older gamers would find the Wii's line-up to be disappointing.The VerdictIf I wrote this review two years earlier, I would have totally recommended the Wii. However, with the Wii U out, there really isn't any reason to. The graphics are better, the online functionality is better, the power is better, and it can even play Wii games! For those who already own a Wii, don't take this the wrong way. It's a pretty great system. I still have my old one and play it occasionally. The only thing is, with the backwards compatibility of the Wii U, there is no reason to get one now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

But when I try to play by myself I realize that I look like a mental patient plus I get tire of swinging my arms just for the character hit a ball.So the way I see it the Wii is fun and innovative to a point because the technical specs are not worthy to be call next generation (looks like they just jam an improve version of the old Gamecube inside the Wii), for me it was fun to play with family and friends not when you are alone. In the contrary the way you play the games its really innovative, but to be honest it gets old really quickly.Maybe I'm to old for this console in fact if you look at the game list, its clear that Nintendo intended this console to be for kids. I keep my Wii as a novelty or party trick if you will since I don't use it very often.Mean while I get my game on my xbox360 he understand that I just want to play High Definition, awesome graphics, online first person shooters and car racing games, all that while sitting in my lazyboy.This is a good choice as a family fun game or for small kids, but for true gamers or people ages 16 to 35 this console will be a waste of time and money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2008"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"No Title","reviewText":"Nintendo comes into the 5th generation of gaming with the Nintendo Wii, despite the name(wii, haha), the wii is a home gaming consol that is created by the godfathers of gaming, Nintendo.The one big thing about the Wii is what everyone knows about, the Wii-mote. The Wii-mote is a new twist on a game controller that makes the system more normal to the world. It looks, and functions like a remote control. Instead of moving an anolog stick up, down, and sideways, you just point the 'mote at the screen, and it moves there. Nintendo uses that function in all their games; example, in zelda, you move the 'mote to swipe your sword, or in a shooter, the 'mote moves the gun cross hairs. If the remote still isen't getting you all giddy and mabey not want to use it, fine, some games are gonna use the Gamecube's controller(Smash Bros. Brawl)Next to that, another cool feature is the vitual consol. Virt. console allows you to download any game Nintendo has made(with a internet conection) on a home system, not handheld. The prices are more than stuff from other platforms, like Xbox arcade and whatever Playstation calls their stuff, but it still isen't expensive, the max price is $8. The Wii allows you to play 'cube games, but you can't download it, just stick 'em in. With an internet conection, you can download diffrent channels; theres an weather channel, it gives a 5 day forecast of most cites. Theres a news channel that gives any type of news, from international new to sports and to tech. Theres a photo channel where you can take pics from a digi cam or cell phone and email it.Last of all is the Mii's and the free game, Wii Sports. Wii Sports is a free game that comes with the system, it has 5 diffrent sports(bowling, boxing,tennis,baseball,and golf) to play, most of them are gimmicky and not deep at all, but there great to play with parents or grandparents. The Mii's are avatars(or caracatures) that you get to play in Wii Sports and other titles(not all), there fun to make and you can get 'em to resemble celebs.The Wii's the hot new thing these days, if you liked, do like, or never played videogames, buy this, there are developers that are making fun games for the hardcore to the never owed a system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004ML7WOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Ferdy","summary":"Short and Mostly One Note","reviewText":"I'm a fan of FPS games and also of horror themed games so this seemed like the perfect combo.  I was really excited to give it a try.  The graphics are really nice - there's a little of that old gangster movie feel to them.  All the controls work well.  I didn't have any glitches.  My complaint is that the game was really short and didn't give you much to do other than go from one area to another and shoot or rip apart everyone in sight.  It is the continuation of the story of Jackie Estacado from the original Darkness game.  He is now head of the \"family\" and has been keeping the Darkness under control, but a new enemy, The Brotherhood, has forced him to release it by going after everyone in his family.  There seemed to be plenty of chances for the game to expand into other areas but none of them ever went very far.  For instance, there are relics that you have to collect in each level and they have really interesting stories and powers as described by Johnny, the wacko who is being held in your library.  It would have been fun if some of them could have been used in the fight with the Brotherhood but all you get is a sort of Wikipedia description of what the relic is.  Also, there are periods when Jackie thinks he is in an asylum but that story line goes in and out really quickly with no chance for much interaction at all. I also had trouble in figuring out where enemies were firing from.  You have to stay out of the light or your health goes down but quite often you have to go through lighted areas in order to fight your enemies and when you can't find them, you can get killed off pretty easily.  In this game, you get to play as the darkling.  When Jackie can't escape an area, he can close his eyes and see thru the Darklings eyes as it navigates air vents and small spaces.  That adds a little interest.  There were lots of points when the game could have been expanded by giving Jackie a side mission to accomplish but it was always barrelling straight ahead.  I played this on the normal difficulty level and in most games, that's hard for me.  IN this game, I finished it in about 6 hours total.  For $60, I would have liked a little more play time.  And as far as I'm concerned, the replay value is pretty low.  After you know what happens, it's not much fun to just go through shooting the same guys over again.  If you're a fan of the original game, it's worth a play through but I'd definitely wait to get a used version or until the price drops.  I just didn't feel this was worth the $60 I paid.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Alucard \"xNosferatux\"","summary":"Good game but could use improvements","reviewText":"I have played RE 0-6. I didn't bother with operation racoon because I had a feeling it would suck, and it did. With RE6, I was hopeful that it would be a lot better.This game is definitely good in terms of slightly improving RE 5 as far as the action goes and adding four different campaigns into one game.However, the resident evil series weren't meant to be strictly action, and unfortunately, a lot of this game was all about the action. Leon's campaign was the only one that came close to having a little \"survivor horror\". All the others campaigns were too much action oriented. After playing the game, I just gave up on trying to find the \"scary parts\" and enjoyed the game for being an action game. So, Chris' campaign ended up being the best(if you like the action, in my opinion). Unfortunately, besides having a good grasp of the action and adding 4 campaigns into one game, I can only say more negative things about the game than I can about it being good. They are not major negatives, so it didn't destroy the game for me.Main Cons:less survivor horror...way too much actiontoo many quick time events...way too manydialogue was cheesy at times(I could literally know what the character was going to say, especially Leon and Jake...super cheesy dialogue coming from them)storyline fell short...it was like they just wanted to add this whole idea of zombie DOOMSDAY but they didn't really focus on making a great storyline. It just wasn't interesting.zombies carried guns( a lot)...j'avo might as well just be mutated looking people with guns that don't really do anything cool to set them apart; main characters didn't even have many bullets to begin withagent hunt wasn't as fun as I thought it would be...mercenary got boring after a while(but that's my own opinion, I'm sure others loved it)some of the characters were just made to look weak or out of context ( despite ada being a double agent, leon still hangs onto her even though she's been dealing with the whole virus ordeal...sherry was made to be this weak little girl who relied on jake a lot)camera was awful at times and game wasn't very good at showing players how to use certain thingsDespite this cons, I still liked the game. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it certainly needs a lot of improvement. I'm not asking for strict survival horror, but a mix would have been good. RE4 did a good job with that. The story in RE5 was a lot more interesting than 6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"This \"-F\" for horror fans is a \"+B\" for action fans!","reviewText":"Many popular game sites still cannot get their fill of ragging on Resident Evil 6. Though it's been awhile since the game released, it's still a hot-topic and literal pi&ntilde;ata the press is gleefully beating!With my reviews I try to be as honest as I can but of course they're simply my opinions. I certainly wouldn't want to lead anyone astray and have them spend their hard earned money on something they hate. I'm an average person like the rest of you. I don't always have $60.00 to drop on a game each month which is why I usually wait for a decent price drop. I picked up RE 6 when it cost me $31.00 with shipping. Was it worth it? It really depends on the type of person you are...If you're a survival horror fanIf you're looking for a \"scary game\" with a psychologically gripping storyline and a few unexpected narrative twists than RE 6 is NOT the game you've been waiting for. Compared to games such as Clock-tower, Silent Hill, Siren, Fatal Frame, Haunting ground, Rule of rose, Corpse Party, Deadly Premonition, and Amnesia, Resident Evil 6 is a dud of a game. Comparatively it's the equivalent of buying an expensive bottle-rocket that supposedly bursts into multiple loud colorful explosions yet when you light it all it does is fizzle out and tip over even before it launches.For most of us into horror we can forgive dated graphics or awkward controls so long as the game itself is interesting, thought provoking, delightfully strange, and genuinely unnerving. Unfortunately I have to confess RE 6 has none of these traits going for it. Whereas games such as Deadly Premonition are at least original and oddly endearing despite their lack of a budget, RE 6 is that behemoth of a triple A title that has plenty of cinematic special effects and elaborate set pieces yet its' heart is nowhere to be found.Listen, if you love \"survival horror\" it's best to wait until RE: Revelations is ported over from the 3DS onto the 360 and PS3. \"That\" is the RE experience you've been waiting for fright-fans!If you're an action adventure junkyBefore you write of Resident Evil 6 is a failed experiment gone terribly wrong let me play devil's advocate a moment. There are those of us who like games beyond the survival horror genre. There are those of us who don't mind an entertaining third person shooter so long as we get a lot of bang for our collective buck. Assuming you can forgive a clich&eacute;d cheesy plot and a few control issues Resident Evil 6 is a great game!The sheer amount of diverse monstrosities to slay has never been more varied in a game of this ilk. The J'avo in particular often go through an insect-like chrysalis as you wound them, drastically mutating into more powerful or more agile abominations. Classic zombies also make a return and this time even standard  undead have \"special types\" ala Left 4 Dead. There are heavyset oversized zombies, leapers, acid vomiters, and even banshee screamers that can paralyze the heroes/heroines with a shrill shriek.Each of the 4 campaigns sends you globe trotting to unique locations and the boss fights are plentiful and pulse pounding.  Many creature features return from the grave later on in typical horror movie fashion or they transform into even more powerful variants of themselves. There certainly isn't a single dull moment in RE 6.Though mostly an action shooter, RE 6 did take the time to throw in some vehicle segments, stealth missions, and even a few demented rounds of hide & seek. Most of these slight deviations from RE 6's core fundamentals were great. However, I found the camera conspired against me on a couple of occasions. If that were not enough having to tap LT & RT repeatedly just to climb a rope or scale a wall feels counter intuitive and very awkward. It's not that it's super-difficult but it does feel tacked on and unnecessary.In spite of its' shortcomings, RE 6 does remain a very fun action thriller experience. Assuming you enjoyed the first GI JOE movie or you perceive foreign  films such as Tokyo Gore Police as guilty pleasures, this will be a welcomed edition to your entertainment library.OfferingsResident Evil 6 has continued the tradition of awarding multiple play-throughs. As you progress through the game you find prestige points that unlock a plethora of unique skills. Whether you need a steadier aim, faster recovery time, more item drops, improved defense, or better melee combat training, you'll probably be able to purchase something that's to your liking. Additionally, getting a high rank on missions awards you with \"special guns\" that are more powerful than your starting arsenal.Scattered around each stage are blue serpent emblems that give you better background information on the story. It's a nice added incentive as motivation to \"find all the collectibles\" but I kind of wish capcom would find more clever and organic ways to expand our knowledge of what's going on.Lastly, unlockable costumes make a return! However, this time they're limited to \"mercenaries\" and procuring them often ties in to how well you do in this mode. (Or you can become a member of re.net and purchase them with your in-game points)As if mercenaries wasn't enough of a side diversion, there's also \"agent hunt mode\". This allows you to enter someone else's game as a monster to rain on their parade. Is it fulfilling? Maybe, but I haven't indulged in it just yet. I've been focused mainly on the core campaigns which are more fascinating to me as a long-time re-fan. (I'm presently on the last campaign as Ada Wong)Updates and changesRE 6 has been updated twice. Supposedly Ada was given her own partner allowing her scenario to have co-op support like the others. Secondly, the action button prompts can be turned off to make many of the cinematic quick time events much easier to pull off.Assuming you stayed away from RE 6 because of the QTEs, it shouldn't be as much of a problem at present. Just thought I'd bring that up!In conclusion: Should you buy?I suggest hardcore survival horror gamers give this one a pass-over. However, if you can also appreciate bombastic action adventure third person shooters like I can RE 6 is totally worth owning. Certainly it's not the most refined or responsive 3rd person shooter I've ever played but overall it is bursting out of its' seams with content and replay value!RE 6 as a survival horror game: Disappointing and lackluster. Hey, I'm telling it like it is!RE 6 as an action thriller game: Mostly awesome but not entirely perfect. The camera and some of the control prompts could have used a bit more fine tuning. However, the sheer amount of content, added maneuverability, ability to walk & shoot, beautifully intricate environments, and diversified enemy bestiary more than make up for the shortcomings!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

NONE.  i don't care what reviews say or what anyone else says, you have NONE.  at all times, you must meet the demands of two different panels, the needs panel and the aspirations panel (and avoid fears).  what does this mean?  AT ALL TIMES YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER IS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO AT ALL TIMES.  this is entertainment?  no.  it's no different than some guy telling you \"ring this bell\" over and over, and you have to do it to win a game that has no reward.now, i knew the needs panel was going to be a factor, and it's (surprisingly) fun.  who knew it could be fun to do the dishes, or lay on the couch?  this is where the sims tricks you.  then as you get addicted, you realize, for one thing, YOU HAVE NOOOOO free time.  and i mean none.  AT ALL TIMES you will HAVE to do the dishes, take out the trash, pay bills, or whatever.  i mean literally at ALL times, because this game is that demanding.  your levels are constantly falling and you're constantly trying to keep them at a reasonable or better level.  it's work, work, work.  also the \"free will\" option is an absolute joke.  if you use the free will option, your sim will be in big trouble.  let's say you have 4 things to do:  take out the trash, take a shower, cook a pop-tart and put it in the trash.  on free will, your sim might do 2 of those things and then be completely helpless.  the name of the sims 2 should be MICRO-MANAGEMENT TO THE MAX.i'm not saying there aren't great things about the sims 2.  it's a very different idea (at least it seems so at first), the graphics, details, even the music playing on the sims' radios is copmletely amazing and creative.  but considering they failed on the most fundamental level of video games (to give you some control over the game, and make the game your own) makes this game a true failure.  after all, isn't that the whole point of the sims??  to make something of your own?  to have free will???  if you don't believe me, notice that all the online reviews of the sims 2 were written by reviewers who didn't play it for very long.  same thing for amazon.  one amazon reviewer wrote she was hooked on the sims 2 for a month and then got sick of it.  that's about what happened to me.  i was hooked on it until i realized what i was doing.  now i don't even want to look at this stupid game.  so expect to enjoy it for a week or so, and then be bored to tears.  you've been warned.p.s. i also had some other problems.  you start the game, and there are 3 different neighborhoods with different houses.  this was great, until i realized there's no way to re-play these families, so once you mess with them even a little bit, your gameplay is saved and irreversible.  also i have no interest in building a new house of my own or whatever, so this seemed even more stupid to me.  also i ran across a couple of bugs.  one ruined a whole family for me- a baby fell on the floor, and a bug made it where i couldn't pick the baby up no matter what.  this made the mother so upset, she couldn't do anything.  so i had to not play that family at all.  they could have at least included more families or a way to re-play the pre-set families.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2005"}

For this price I recommend picking up this game for sure, it is game of the year for a reason! =)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Anja Rebekka Schultze","summary":"Solid RPG Title","reviewText":"Dragon Age 2 is set after the events of the first game, you can choose which ending the former game had or even import the ending you achieved in the first installment of the series. In Dragon Age 2 you play a young refugee who is fleeing from the event of the first game and then try to build a new life for him or her self in the streets of the city Kirkwall all the while trying to develop relationships with a colorful cast of allies and maneuver through various conflicts within the city.The first thing I should mention about Dragon Age 2 is that there is no grinding, this game was clearly designed with a wider audience in mind and as such it do not just cater to the RPG fan who might enjoy spending hours just grinding through hordes of monsters to level up one's characters, in Dragon Age 2 you go through quests, and while quite a few of the quests will lead to combat there are no time in the game where you have to fight and fight and fight to develop the character, you can enough EXP just by doing quests.One of the problems with Dragon Age 2 is that is had become so simplified, the combat system have lost most of the strategic elements from the first game, you no longer can choose between a wide range of backgrounds and different races when you create your character, you have to play a human and your only choice is whatever or not you are a mage, a warrior or a rouge, and what sex your character is. Equipment is also simplified, this choice might make the game more approachable to novice RPG players and gamers who prefer other genre, but it might disappoint long time RPG fans, leveling, equipment, fighting, none of these is really important in Dragon Age 2, what is important is following the storyline, something that would be good, but...In Dragon Age Origins you have a complicated and epic storyline, there are allot of side quests yes but there is a overarching storyline, in Dragon Age 2 the whole game feels like it is patched together by side quests, yes some of these side quests from together into bigger story lines, however I have some difficulty telling you what exactly this game is about, mostly you run around, do quests and build your standing in the city, in a way this game feels a bit like D&D; meets The Sims. That being said the various quests are often interesting, the setting is excellent and the various characters you meet are well made and the game make good use of it's brilliant cast of voice actors.Sound in this game is very good, the music is appropriate, sound effects work and the voice acting is amazing, it is quite funny just to listen to the various characters chatter amongst themselves. Graphics wise the game is quite good but it do slip up at places, however technically the game is solid.Me and my hubby is now on our second play through of Dragon Age 2, the game is big and have multiple ways to go through the game giving it excellent replay value, I do wish that there where more of a prominent storyline in the game, however all in all I do not have many complaints, Dragon Age 2 is a good and fun game with characters you will get to care about, it is also a good starting game for fans of other computer game genre as it do not contain endless grinding to level one's characters. Also while having played the former game is a benefit as Dragon Age 2 reference it often, this game is a stand alone game and you can easily enjoy it without having playing Dragon Age Origins.*Spoiler Warning* One thing I feel I have to mention for Norwegian audiences is that Dragon Age 2 have one plot twist towards the end which might upset those affected by the recent terrorist attacks in Oslo and on Utya. Towards the end of Dragon Age 2 one of your allies, a mage name Anders places a magical bomb in a key building in Kirkwall and blow it sky high for political reasons. Now a blond, political radical named Anders (The same name as the Utya terrorist)blowing up buildings in the middle of the city might be a to painful remainder for those affected by the Utya terrorist attacks. Now I am not saying this game is inspired by the attacks, it was finished long before they took place, however coincidence have created elements in this game that is eerily similar in some ways to what happened and for some Norwegians this might be just to soon.*End of Spoiler.*","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009MVJ7","description":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"Serfius","summary":"An enjoyable game","reviewText":"To me, this game was a lot better than BG1.

{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Bill Stockstill \"&#34;Bill&#34;\"","summary":"Great Online Play...most of the time","reviewText":"I feel compelled to write a review of this game that I have been playing since the day it came out. I have advanced through the ranks and now am at the next to last level on online play. Its been really fun playing online most of the time. The online game consists of either defending a series of bases with 2 crates of gold bars or attacking those bases. Being a defender or attacker rotates between games. Offline, I have played a couple of hours and I find the dialog pretty funny between the characters.Its nice that once you get killed in the offline game, you are at the same place when you respawn and don't have to start the whole level over. This game has a lot going for it and its more then an \"arcade\" game I read somewhere else.Pros-Great graphics, as good as COD4-Intense realistic battle-Easy to connect onlikne and few lag issues although a few times I had to restart the game because it said it could not find any games-You can choose to respawn at your spawn or with a random member of your 4 man squad-90% of objects in the game are destructible-Great weapon choices-Many vehicle typesCons-The scoring is easily manipulated since tasks such as healing team mates and fixing vehicles get points. At one point, a top 10 leader board player had only 10 kills. I was ranked several hundred places down and had over 1000 kills.-You have many weapon choices but can do no customization on them like in Socom.-The game is more then just an arcade game and actually you need to think about strategy. Unfortunately, you may find many of your team mates aren't thinking about objectives, the team or the squad. Some examples. 1 One class can heal itself, another can throw health kits. There is no health in the game. If you play as the type of soldier that can give med packs, \"X\"s flash on your map in the corner for team mates that need health. Some players never give out health and if you play a class of soldier that doesn't have a way to increase health after taking damage you die much more. 2 Some attacking bases have artillery. Once the attackers destroy the 2 crates in the defenders base one, the attacker's spawn moves to the defender's former base and the defenders start to spawn in another base. The artillery covers pretty much all the bases. So, if you are defending, it is wise to get back to the base with artillery since the attacking team is no longer spawning there and use it on the attackers. Many times I have done this only to arrive to see one of my team has just destroyed the artillery. Very frustrating. 3 Another example. Many love to snipe. Great. But if you are on the attacking team, you can't destroy the objectives by sitting half way across the map and sniping. This is frustrating for a couple of reasons. You have no help at the object and when you get killed and have a choice of respawn, your squad members are nowhere near the objective so you are forced to spawn at your usually far away base.-Team mate play would not be so much of a problem if the mic system worked. May can't talk, can't hear, or both in game. This is probably as much a PS3 issue as with the game because there are other games people have problems with, but this game has been the worse.-You can't choose your squad mates or which squad mate to spawn with.-I have gotten someone on my friends list to join me in a squad the only time I tried. You go to a special screen, use the PSN friends list of type there name and you send them a message through the PSN message system. You stay there until they join the game appear on the squad list. Then you choose the map you prefer and join the game with your friend. What is wrong with this is you can't join friends already in games. You don't have a list of games either, like COD4 does not have either.Overall a great game that needs the mics fixed, leader board fixed, a better way to play with friends and hopefully players will start to play more strategically as time goes on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2008"}
