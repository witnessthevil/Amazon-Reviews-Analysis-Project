{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Ogar Ogar","summary":"You Will Like strategy Games!!!!","reviewText":"Xcom UFO DEFENSE has long been held as one of the greatest strategy games when it released. after many iterations (some in line with original, others shifting their focus) Firaxis Games took it upon themselves to reboot this classic. The results could have easily been mediocre b/c they stuck to the design of the original or deviate too much. Jake Solomon & Sid Meier should be commended for create a game that meshes the best aspects of the old and new. It pays homage to die-hard fans by offering the historic high difficulty settings of the past(on in which you cannot even save the game). It also adds new features that are intuitive and make Strategy gameplay easy to get into if you have never engaged the genre. This is an excellent game that I simply cannot reccommend enough.

{"product_name":"B003O6HAS2","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Excellent for what it is","reviewText":"Clearly the game is not intended for hard core gamers who typically prefer God of War or Gears of War, but rather for a casual gamer or younger audience. I happen to be a hard core gamer and yet I still find I am quite enjoying this game based mostly on how it makes good use of the Move controller.Pros:- Good use of the Move controller- everything from casting spells to mixing potions.- Recognition of commands with the Move is pretty accurate most of the time.- The visuals are decent. The look of it is appropriate to the type of game it is.- Ability to combine elemental spells reminds me of the game, Magicka, which I enjoy considerably. Nice to have a gestural version of Magicka.- Ability to research different combinations of ingredients to yield different spells.- Ability to change difficult level during the game.- Game pacing is good. It knows your arms will be tired after an intense bout and so gives you a break.Cons:- Short game.- Camera control is annoying some times.- In practice the need to combine powers is minimal as soon as you get the lightning element.Younger gamers who are into casting magical spells like Harry Potter are likely to enjoy this game a lot.Players who enjoy a game on its own unique merits (in this case the use of the Move in well thought out ways) will likely enjoy this brief distraction also.Players who couldn't care less about ingenuity and just want to blast aliens like in Gears of War, should probably skip this title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003RS8HG6","description":"","reviewerName":"ICUH8N","summary":"Overall a good Rock Band entry and certainly better than Guitar Hero, but not w/o a few face-palm inducing bad design decisions","reviewText":"I suppose as with any sequel there are some nice improvements but also unnecessary drawbacks. I'll go with a good, bad and ugly style format for my review.NOTE: I haven't played pro drums or pro guitar so I won't comment on those features.*********************THE GOOD*********************USER-FRIENDLINESS* A completely streamlined, straightforward and improved playing system. You can now continue to play a song after failing, adjust the difficulty mid-song and people can drop in or out while a song is going on. In all this is a much needed improvement over RB2 and helps to keep things going at parties or with friends, especially if \"beverages\" are involved.GRAPHICS* The graphics and artistic style are great and help make you feel as though you're an actual rock stud. Easily the best of any music/rhythm game.NEW GAME MODES* Pro modes add in an extra level of difficulty for seasoned veterans, though admittedly the cost of entry for the new instruments is pretty prohibitive and as such will only be experienced by the very hard-core music gaming enthusiasts.QUICKPLAY* You now earn fans while in quickplay making that mode feel more meaningful than in past installments and quickplay overall has more sorting features and much easier to navigate.NEW CHALLENGES* The little challenges in setlists are nice additions and give you something extra to earn. For instance, you may have to hit all the notes in certain stretches or see how many times you can activate star power. It's been done before in music games, but seems like the idea is perfected this time around.SONG EXPORTATION* If you've already exported your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2 they'll (mostly) carry over into Rock Band 3, too. In all you'll have a HUGE library of songs unrivaled by any other music game given exportation of RB and RB2 plus your DLC. The only negative is the price, but I'll touch on that in my UGLY section...UNLOCKING SONG* All the songs are unlocked right from the get-go meaning you don't have to punch in a code or spend hours unlocking songs for you and your friends to enjoy.*********************THE BAD*********************UNLOCKING OUTFITS* The outfit unlocking system is not nearly as straightforward or enjoyable as in RB2. Rather than earning money that can in turn be spent on new items you now have to complete certain in-game challenges. This is really disadvantageous if you stick to only one or two instruments or if your skill level isn't high enough to attain an item you want. It was much more user friendly and motivational to save up your cash for that one item you really wanted, whether that was a pig mask or angel wings.STAGE PROGRESSION* Rather than having to earn stars to unlock the next stages you now have to have earn more fans. This is really annoying since you'll spend time retreading the same venues (even as early as unlocking the 3rd stage). Rock Band 2's map system just made more system and the thrill discovering the new venues, songs and setlists is missed.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION* Though you can change your attire on the fly you cannot do so for your character's physical attributes. Once you give him that ridiculously large nose there's no going back. Instead you have to create a 100% brand new character, being sure he or she is exactly how you want before hitting that create button.*********************THE UGLY*********************POOR KEYBOARD SUPPORT* In short, do not buy this game if your only reason for doing so is the new keyboard functionality as support for the $80 keyboard peripheral is really weak. Only 63 of the songs include any keyboard tracks at all and of those many feature long stretches of keyboard silence or criminally easy keyboard parts.SETLIST* Though musical tastes differ it would've been nice to see more bands/artists that have fun and interesting tracks across all instruments. If you're a one-instrument guy (especially keyboardist) you're going to be really bored during at least a third (or more) of the game's tracks. Such bands/artists that would've been obvious choices (off the top of my head): Dream Theater, Rush, Fair To Midland, Muse, The Who, Pink Floyd, Alan Parson's Project, Blind Guardian, A-Ha, Moby, Genesis, Fun Lovin Criminals, Powerman-5000, KMFDM, Gorillaz, Coldplay, Blackfield, Depeche Mode, Linkin Park, Dragonforce, Radiohead, Michael Jackson, The Eagles, Billy Joel, Andrew WK, Stratovarius, Prince, Stabbing Westward or Europe (Final Countdown!!). At the very least they could've added in some keyboard parts to existing songs in the event you have that instrument plugged in (and absent if you're not using it). Also, do we really need FOUR Lynyrd Skynyrd songs? Yeah, they're an okay band but a bit overkill...PRICE OF ROCK BAND 2 EXPORTATION* 800 MS Points ($10) seems like a steep and unexpected price to import your old RB2 tracks into RB3. Granted the import in Rock Band is way more inclusive than in Guitar Hero, but it just feels cheap to charge us so much for songs we've previously paid for.TATTOO/BAND ART ORGANIZATION* The organization of tattoos and band art is really difficult to navigate through. You may say this is nitpicking, but bear with me...Let's say you're scrolling through the artistic styles and find a few pieces you like and want to mix together. You select your first piece of art and then the game returns you to the top of the \"select a style\" list, so now you have to scroll through all the artistic styles trying to remember which one contains the art you like. It does this EVERY time you set a new art layer. The worst is any attempt to spell out a word, just baffling how long it takes to do something as simple as scribe out a 4-letter word. Ug, just thinking about this horrible design makes me want to chuck my keyboard across the room.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"My First  \"Real\" RPG-Wow!","reviewText":"I have been into games for a long time-started playing on the PC and when my PC got to elderly to play current gen games I decided to get into consoles (it just seemed easier and cheaper then constantly upgrading a pc); I have a PS2, XBOX and now a 360 and a large library of games, all the major releases really EXCEPT, i have never been much interested in RPG's. (I do have Fable, but many of my gaming friends say while that is a very good game, and an RPG, it is not on the order of, say, Everquest or similar titles). After I got my 360 though, I was going through the game reviews on here to find some 360 games I might think of purchasing, and became very interested in this game after reading the (mostly) positive reviews. I purchased the \"collector's edition\" (which is evidently even more of a collector's edition because I happened to get a copy that was still rated \"T\" instead of \"M).\"Anyway I loaded the disk, turned on my controller, and sat down to play, with an open mind; I figured if i didn't like it, I could always trade it back for a good exchange. Well, was I suprised that, the next time I looked up, SEVEN HOURS had passed by!The graphics of the world are amazing. For those that don't know yet, you start out in a prison cell, (this is where you create your character, including gender, and main attributes),  and are pulled into the main story as some guaruds loyal to the Emperor are trying to smuggle him out of the area to prevent his assasination. This part of the game serves a a tutorial, walking you through moving around, using your inventory, picking things up, and so forth, then a bit later you choose your \"class,\" I guess the term is (I picked knight), till finally you get to an exit, here the game gives you a chance to change your character, then it autosaves and you exit into the world.At this point, if you followed the tutorial, you have various items and a few well worn weapons to get you started. What is so awesome about this game is you can, even more so than GTA or whatever, do exactly and totall what you want. You can start right on the main quest here, or start out like I did, walk to the nearest town and just start exploring it (I came out of the sewers at night time, so there weren't many people around save for guards). If you want, you can NEVER finish the main quest, or never even start it. You can go about on your own, join guilds, form factions, help people out, be evil, (once you can beat them in combat I guess), kill whoever you want, buy items, buy property, and on and on and on. I can't even list or think of everything. I walked around for at least an hour just looking at stuff, lol. Next I found a shop, and while the shop keepers back was turned I stole everything on the shelves behind him, hee hee.Just for the tiny bit I have done so far, I can see that this game can indeed provide hundreds and hundreds of hours of game play; in fact, one tip I have heard from some people is, keep that first autosave; go back to it, start all over with a whole new class, etc. This could keep you playing for years!Right now, I'm still trying to decide whether to be really evil or not. It's easy to be a sneak theif, but from what I've seen, not a killer. Probably it's because I haven't leveled up yet, and everyone I tried to attack (yes I tried to kill the shop keeper and he kicked my *** and called the guard :( ) is five or six levels above me, lol. And it is totally futile, at least at my level of development, to fight with anyone, especially guards. So, hmmm maybe I'll do some quests, and be a shoplifter. Seriously this game is so much fun, it's hard to describe. After getting out of jail for attacking the shop keeper (:P) i spent what turned out to be a few more hours of wandering around. I did encounter a highwayman, decided not to give up my few bits of gold, and fought him, I won,(by pure luck I guess, but was almost dead--thanks to the tutorial though I knew to use my little \"heal yourself's wounds\" spell). Now, defending yourself, of course, is not a crime, in fact, if there are guards around when you are being attacked they will come over and defend you (and probably kill the threat for you since they all seem to be like level 15 or so). Sweet!  If you have a 360, and don't have this game yet, get it. Even if you're not into RPG (I sure wasn't) you will be hooked!Thanks everyone for all the good advice!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2006"}

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Dylan","summary":"Best Game Ever","reviewText":"I love this game so I'm gonna break the review down into 3 sections Campain,Special ops,and Multiplayer.Campain 5/5 starsThe campain is just great good graphics really good story great charcters Great missions and guns.The best mission on the campain is Contigency it is a stealth mission at first the it go to a loud mission.Really great campain.Special ops 5/5 starsThe Special ops are really great good graphics good missions and really good star and unlocking systems.The best mission on special ops in my opinion is big brother which requires 2 players.Multiplayer 5/5 starsThe Multiplayer is really good great guns ranking and perks.My favorite part of multiplayer is you don't need to go on the internet to rank up.The best map on This is the small Afganistan Map it is a fast paced small map very beast.Thank you for reading this review hope it persuaded you to purchase this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}

That right there tells me that the ideas were there but whether through time constraints or budget constraints it just never made it into the game.  It's not often I'll rate a product so low but this is a rare exception.  The game is bad and the nostalgia factor only allows you to look past a couple problems.  When the problems start taking away from your love of the movies and comics then you know something is just wrong.  The sad fact is that most people will look at this game and see &#34;Gearbox&#34; on the cover and immediately think it's good because of their work with Borderlands.

{"product_name":"B005VBVQBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Kyle Otto \"Go Sabres!\"","summary":"Great deal, Fable 3 is very fun!","reviewText":"Great deal. Both games are fun, but especially surprisingly Fable III! Grab this bundle if you're ready for the latest Xbox 360 slim. It's much quieter, smaller, and uses half the power as the older Xbox 360. Worth noting however is they have a tendency to vibrate. I actually had Amazon ship me a replacement bundle because of my vibration. It vibrated differently (more vibes at idle, less at full speed, for certain discs), but I preferred the vibes of my original system so I sent the replacement back. It turns out it depends mostly on the discs as some vibrate far more than others, but the consoles themselves just aren't very well vibration-proofed. The case doesn't have a lot of positive pressure in many areas, so it'll get quite loud at times until you press on it with your finger with moderate pressure, then it goes away for a while. Meh, if you're playing a game and have your volume at a medium or higher level, you won't even notice. Nothing to worry about mechanically... I guess. More of a heads up in case you notice this, be aware it's MOST consoles of this particular model, not just you. A quick Google search will reveal that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Jim \"Pimmy\"","summary":"A must have game for all StarWars fans!","reviewText":"StarWars: Knights of the Old Republic is an awesome game. It has better writing and better character build up than the prequels. It's too bad that Lucas didn't get the creators of this game to help him with the script for Episode 3. I'm sure it won't be as exciting or as fun as playing this game. You get to create your own character and choose your path. You get to choose whether you want to follow the path of the darkside or the lightside. You also get to have some pretty exciting lightsaber duels as well.Plus the Sith are so evil in this game they make Darth Maul look like....well Jar-Jar Binks. Darth Malek is the best StarWars villain since Darth Vader and he's only a video game character. You get to visit awesome new enviroments that haven't been seen in any of the movies.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Gordon \"A. Gord.\"","summary":"Diablo 3 - from someone new to Diablo","reviewText":"---I've never played D1 or D2, so some of these things may have been the same in previous games as well---*********************************************************************************Diablo 3 isn't garbage, but it's not that great.I definitely do not think that it is worth $60. If it were $20, that may be a different story.I'll break it down into pros and cons (tldr below).Pros:*Graphics - Personally, I like the graphics. I understand that they're a bit too \"cartoonified\" for some people, but I think they are aesthetically pleasing. The cinematic graphics are awesome as well.*Voice acting - Okay, see the dialogue con for the other side of this story. I think they chose some good voice actors and these actors did a good job.*Combat - The combat is the only thing that keeps me playing this game (well, that and friends). There are definitely flaws in the combat system, but overall it is pretty fun. You get a lot of really flashy and exciting abilities and the bosses are pretty neat, especially on higher difficulties.*Music - Eh, it's decent. I didn't want to put it as a con, but it's far from the best video game music. WoW has a better soundtrack.Cons:*Dialogue/writing - The dialogue and writing in this game are awful. Although I think the voice actors were pretty good, a lot of their acting seemed bad because of how silly the writing was. There were so many cliche and corny lines that I thought I was watching an episode of Power Rangers during some of the cinematics (I am justice itself?...)*Customization (or lack of) - There is no customization in this game. It's absolutely pathetic and makes me think that Blizzard has gone so far downhill that nothing will ever bring them back. ZERO physical customization. Really? How hard would it have been for them to at least let us slightly customize our characters in a game where we are often playing ONLINE? Everyone looks identical. It is boring and incredibly lazy. Whoever decided to scrap physical customization should never work in the gaming industry ever again. There is also next to no class customization either (you can change your abilities whenever). This detracts from the replay value IMMENSELY (as well as the RP potential... actually there is NO RP in this game whatsoever. It might as well just be an action game).*Controls - The controls are terrible. This was apparent the second I started playing. You have to click to move AND use some of your abilities. I often find myself randomly running around in circles as I'm trying to click on enemies that are moving or clicking on the ground to loot. I notice my friends doing this too and it is pretty entertaining (but annoying and poorly designed).*Online Requirement - You must be online for single player. Luckily, I find this game mind numbingly boring by myself, so I'm always playing with friends, but it is still immensely annoying (lag and dc's happen to me with an awesome connection; that would bug the hell out of me if I was playing alone).*Loot - For a game that's centered around loot, you'd think that it would be more exciting. It's not. I guess I expected something like WoW or NWN where you have hundreds to thousands of awesome looking, unique armor and weapons (instead of generic random stuff).*Repetition - It's just too repetitive. They would have been better off with only 3 difficulties IMO. Having to play the game FOUR TIMES to beat all the difficulties is ridiculous, considering it already gets repetitive during the first play through.*RL$AH - Just a stupid way for a greedy company to make extra cash. It's a bad idea. I have no idea why anyone would even spend real money on gear for their characters in this game when the gear is so unoriginal anyway. You could buy the best legendary armor with $ but then what are you going to do with it??? The whole point of the game is to GRIND for loot and work your way through the higher difficulties, so this AH defeats the purpose of the game. Why would a gaming company add something that negates the point of their game? (I should also say that I think this will add to the hacking and gold selling market; I'm already seeing the spam in chat and it will only get worse).*The ending - Perfect example of terrible writing. It was cliche, corny, cheesy, anticlimactic, etc. Act 4 felt rushed, then basically the bad guy dies, hooray we are all happy, humans and angels live together forever omg yay!!! What is this a Disney movie!? Normally at the end of a video game (at least a good one), I feel a sense of happiness and sadness (sad that it's over, happy at how much fun I had with it). At the end of this I felt annoyed.*********************************************************************************************TLDR: Fun for a while, especially with friends, but overall cliche, poorly written, repetitive, and has annoying controls and an online requirement. Worth playing, but NOT for $60.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

UBI Soft as a \"feature\" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in \"some\" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.UBI Soft's tech support has said that this \"feature\" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  \"Flawed\" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their \"feature\", not about the game itself.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2004"}

I think they made this game primarily for the online multiplayer part of it.  As for the online multiplayer part of it, I will warn you, you play as a female, but there is a way to change your online character into a male in one of the options parts, I forget where it is but you can easily find out how to do it if you look it up on the internet.  Other than that, it's a whole new online experience, the maps are a lot larger and more multilayered I guess you could say than any other before it.  There are lots of places that people like to camp on some of the maps which gets kind of annoying cuz it's kind of hard to figure out how they got to the camping spot they did in order to kill them.  The guns and upgrades in this one have nothing to do with rank, you can get any gun or upgrade you want at any time, what you have to do is rack up enough what they call &#34;Squad Points&#34; to purchase the guns and upgrades.  Definitely the most challenging Call of Duty online multiplayer yet in my opinion.  I was surprised when I first started playing it, which was actually not long after it was released, and there are already people who are badasses at it and with the giant maps it made me feel like a nube all over again.  Lets just say my kill/death ratio sucked for a while till I started learning the maps and where people tend to camp.  As for saying all that the online multiplayer is the most realistic and true to life scenarios yet.

For the most part this is a good thing and after being away from the world of Rapture the past 2 years, a great sense of nostalgia filled my spirits as I explored and plundered the neon-lit gloom of this underwater, art-deco, utopia.  The gameplay itself remains true to the spirit of the original with skill and equipment customizations for various abilities and weaponry, but this time around the action factor seems cranked up a few notches with high intensity combat comprising 85% of your playtime.  What left me ultimately disappointed at the end of it all was the lack of any 'wow' moments that the first game doled out in spades and this is attributed to the fact that this sequel remains so firmly rooted to the original that it seems almost puzzling why more deviation from gameplay and setting weren't utilized.This game is actually deserving of 4-stars but I had to dock it 1 star for 2 bugs that prevented me from progressing and forcing me to utilize earlier save files (save often, kids!), wasting several hours in the process.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"Anja Rebekka Schultze","summary":"Beautiful, nice story but not perfect.","reviewText":"Introduction: I have just finished playing this game, it is what one might expect of a Prince of Persia game, allot of jumping and sword fights. But enough new elements are added to this game to make it rather unique and interesting and not just one more game in an seaming never ending series. The game have beautiful cartoon like graphics, and the setting is interesting enough to capture the imagination, though it may not exactly be a masterpiece in that regard.Game Play: Once again the players take control of the Prince, or in this case a scoundrel that wander of into a strange land in the desert in search of his missing donkey. The game play is very straight forward you jump, perform acrobatics and fight with your sword. To aid you there is a second character, the mage princess Elica, she prevent you from dying, yes you can not dye in this game, and help you with team moves to solve puzzles and the like. The game play work, it is fun but do get extremely repetitive. Most of what you do during the entire game is just jump and slash with a few puzzles now and then. The fact that you can not die in this game might make it to easy for veteran players, though it is perfect for casual players and beginners.Story: The story is this game is rather basic for a fantasy game, it is not a great tale, but it works for the game. It is about a princess, an evil God and a handsome hero trying to save the world, nothing new here, there is also a bit to little of it, it would be nice with more story rewards for all that jumping and slashing but all in all the story work for what it is intended to, to spice up a jump fest game.Graphics: The graphics of this game is detailed and very beautiful, it have an animated movie feel to it, and is very colorful and bright. The characters are marvelous, but the background is to repetitive, they are pretty yes but are all the same. I miss a bit more variation in this game. But all in all the graphics are good.Sound: The music of this game is beautiful and fit well and set the proper mood for the game, the problem with it however is that while it works well there is to little variation here to and one get a bit tired of the same handfull of music scores running again and again and again. The dialouge between the Prince and Elica however is funny, and really drive the game forward and the sound effects are good.Conclusion: I would say this is a good game. I enjoyed it. But I got a bit bored at times with the lack of variation in graphics and gameplay. There are some new elements here, but for all intents and purposes this is same old Prince of Persia in a pretty new wrapping. If you like platform and jumping games then I recommend this game, if you are looking for something new and something with a grand tale to tell then there are better games out there for you. I would give this game 7 out of 10. It is good, but far from a classic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2010"}

In short, there are two versions: aBlack 32GB Black Deluxe Setand aWhite 8GB Basic Set.  I say review the two packages first because the Deluxe version comes with NintendoLand and a few bonuses for only $50 more (a small savings even if you don't consider the extras).The packaged-in disc for NintendoLand seems to serve the same purpose as Wii Sports did for the original Wii--to demonstrate how to use the features of the new system and show the user how to use the system's hardware and software.  While Sports was ultimately very simplistic in graphics and purpose, it ended up being a lot of fun for most Wii users.  Despite its relative simplicity, NintendoLand has a very similar feel, and it may be enjoyable for some time to come.In NintendoLand you are greeted by Monita, a floating screen with a single arm.  Monita shows you around the NintendoLand system, and introduces you to the tablet's controls as well as the mini games that are available to you.  Mini games include fan favorites such as Metroid, Link, Mario, Yoshi, Pikmin, and several others.  Despite the fact that I've already picked up two other games (which I will review later) my wife and I have been playing NintendoLand for several hours.  It is a lot of fun.  The interaction with the wii plus remote and nun chuck are (not surprisingly) very similar to the predecessor system, so I'm not going to go to deep into those features here.Sans the tablet, NintendoLand feels like a HD upgrade to the Wii.  With the tablet NintendoLand demonstrates that the tablet provides a real gem here.  Various games have different requirements--at least one tablet, at least one remote, just remotes, remotes and tablet, etc.  Multiplayer games that include both remote and tablet (for at least two users, of course) are a lot of fun.  No longer are you restricted to just one view on the TV or a split-screened view used in previous systems.  Now one user can use the TV as a primary display while the other user can use the mobile screen of the tablet as well as the larger display of their TV.  Simply put, the table offers exactly what you would expect--a combination of the benefits of a handheld with the benefits of a full console experience.  It is simultaneously interesting and difficult to describe without trying it.As a whole, NintendoLand is a great game offering firsts person shooter, puzzles, and more.  If you did end up purchasing the white basic Wii U set I would still recommend this game (if for no other reason than to get a good primer on how the new system's tablet works with the existing Wii motion plus-enabled remotes).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

Until one day...","reviewText":"Foolish me. Foolish me for liking this game. Foolish me for playing this game. Especially foolish me for assuming I'd have at least some warning before the game ended and I got totally screwed.Yes, \"Fable III\" is an amazing game. Quite lovely to look at, great to play, with some wonderful voice acting and a pretty decent plot. I really got into it and was really enjoying the process of building my character, buying up property and being the monarch.But then...As you know doubt know you eventually become king/queen of Albion. Once that happens you get to make all sorts of choices about how your kingdom is ran and make preparations for an attack that's supposed to happen a year after you take the throne. To make sure all your people survive this attack, you need gobs of money.Now I was being a generous and just ruler and behaving myself and stuff, but the result of that was that when there were 112 days left to the attack, I was overdrawn by about 800,000 gold in my treasury. No problem, I thought. Yes, we'd been speeding through the calendar rather quickly (only about five days of you being the ruler are actually played out), but I figured I could spend the next two or three days as the ruler getting money together and getting everything ready.Then, hey, suddenly it's my anniversary! I'm thinking \"What?\" I'm thinking \"My people are screwed.\" Sure enough a half hour later, I'd beaten the game and every single one of my subjects, except for some guards and palace personnel, were dead. This happened with no warning and not even a hint that I was going to go from 112 days to prepare down to zero.This is not good game design.I was ticked. Royally ticked, as it were. I nearly threw the game into a blender. Instead I sold it to Gamestop and bought myself a copy of the new release of \"Avatar\" on blu-ray. Yeah, that movie was a bit disappointing, too, but not nearly on the same level.It's a great pity, too. Because this was a wonderful, fantastic game that had everything going for it!

However, the graphics in this one feel like a port to PC even more than GTA 3. Vice city was a much better port than this one as far as graphics are concerned. Sound Quality : TIGHT! Everything from Country music to East Coast. The size of the city : HUGE! That's good and bad. It can take so friggin' long to get from one side to the other that a player might get annoyed after a few days of play. However, it is an excellent recreation of an active city. I am running a Pentium 4 3 GHZ with 1 GIG DDR ram and a PCI-express 256 MB ATI video card. With these specs i was able to turn all of the features to MAX. Plus the resolution to 1024X768 and i got a real nice frame rate of over 75. This is a little less than 5 GIG to install and it is well worth it.The premise of the game is not very original, but the way they play it out is intense enough to keep you interested in it. The Bicycle riding feature was primo. A little difficult to control, but a lot of fun. They could've done a little better on this, but they raised the bar so high i am not sure they can get over it. But, this one does out-do the predecessors by a slight margin. Also, the book they package with the game is VERY impressive. A hardcover manual with the DVD disc stored in the back of the book. Lastly, i think they could've toned down just a little on the N*GGER and B*TCH a bit. It fits the atmosphere of the game, but only serves to polish the stereotype of the 'Gangstas'.

You play the ancient Patapons who rely on the Almighty for his beating drum to guide them through war. Throughout the game you can pick up different beats and you have certain combos which do certain attacks, defenses etc. Patapon is a mix between rhythm and RTS...the weirdest combo ever, but it works. The graphics style is cute and attractive...but some of the game isn't.The boss fights are very hard and sometimes feel impossible to beat. You can build you're whole army (which feels kind of small) and have at the boss and you'll still get your @$$ handed to you. You can pick up weapons and armor during your hunts, raids to make your Patapons stronger but sometimes it doesn't feel like it makes a difference.You level up your Patapons by hunting, or fighting more...and this is why I feel the game is very unbalanced. I also feel the game requires too much precision while beating the drum, especially in Fever mode, where you Patapons have super charged strength and attacks but requires so much precision you can't even get into Fever mode half the time.

So, I missed God of War and many other titles.  The reason I mention God of War is because this game is often compared to it.  This game (and Dragon Age, to some extent) is what I picked up to return to console gaming.Right from the beginning, my curiosity was piqued, as Biblical apocalypse themes always seem to fascinate me.  Graphically, this game is beautiful.  Story-wise, it's fairly original (though some ideas remind me of Spawn and other comic book series.)  I really enjoy the gameplay...  The \"combos\" aren't insanely hard to pull off and there's a reasonable amount of challenge to make me work a bit to progress, but not too hard.  Over all, it seemed to feel like a Zelda game:  Get your weaker sword and roam around killing stuff in order to power up and advance.The voice acting is decent over all (which surprisingly, bad voice acting is still easy to come by in todays gaming market!) Musically, I'm entertained.  I don't switch off the game music to listen to something else.Ultimately, I'd give it 4.5 stars, as it's not perfect.

{"product_name":"B006VB2UO6","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"NCAA Football 13 Plays it Safe to Mixed Results","reviewText":"EA Sports played it safe with NCAA Football 13 by addressing some legacy issues while adding a highly marketable mode with the Heisman Challenge. Unfortunately for veterans of the series the game will feel all too familiar and those tempted primarily by the allure of legends may find themselves somewhat unsatisfied with the path they're being led down. NCAA Football 13 is a product as rich in content as it is uninspired in its execution.What follows will act as more of an overview than a detailed review - that is still to come. As a whole the game could be best described as mediocre and inoffensive while still offering a respectable amount of depth and variety in modes. Fans of the series will not find much new - unless Heisman Challenge mode provides intrigue - while the lack of advancement elsewhere is immediately evident. Dynasty does come through with some worthwhile additions but the reach there becomes more limited.Aspects like play action, pass trajectories, screen passes, and non-psychic defensive backs provide the improvement on the field. They represent significant advancements but at the same time it's hard to get all that excited about those things which should have been addressed long ago. Issues with the gameplay however were quickly identified. Poor safety play might be the most glaring of the bunch but at times deficient offensive line blocking along with the CPU being inept running the option and out of shotgun also stand out. User swatting or pick attempts with defensive backs appears to be terribly unresponsive allowing for some passes to be completed without any contesting of the ball. The CPU has also demonstrated some poor clock management and SuperSim is still busted.Otherwise the game plays fairly clean with solid balance between offense and defense.Recognizing just how many problems there are none really will be all that startling to those used to the NCAA series. They can at least be somewhat overlooked, especially considering the actual improvements that are present, but will understandably create some frustration as well. More though should be expected of the game than just being adequate.There seems to be no point to the addition of motion blur other than to make the graphics somewhat worse and to act as a constant slight annoyance. Visually the game is still spectacular despite that. Presentation is less effective with a mishmash of broadcast style shots with replays and post-play scenes that come from cameras on the field that don't exist. Even though there is a disconnect in the post-play scenes - reaction shots often come from a totally different part of the field than when the play ended - at least it's not as utterly embarrassing as what was on display last year. Players still can't seem to walk around without bumping into each other but at least the focus isn't consistently on those interactions.The additions to Dynasty mode are worthwhile. In particular the ESPN Studio Updates and Bottom Line Ticker are effective in making the games within Dynasty feel more important and connected to the other results around the country. However the updates become bland with audio sometimes poorly stitched together and when in the process of playing actually glancing down at the ticker could act as a distraction. More time will have to be spent recruiting but thus far the dynamic pitches, enhanced phone calls, and new scouting have added some much needed spice to the process.Where the NCAA series has failed the most in recent years - and continues to do so with the latest iteration - is in providing a true representation of the college football experience. This is particularly the case in the audio area where crowd noise is often flat and in general doesn't have the effect that one would expect. The lead devs were at the Notre Dame vs Michigan game last year and still couldn't translate that experience to the game which is disheartening. Player reaction scenes are still weak and more often than not feel disconnected from what had just taken place. It's unbelievable how many teams have their uniforms omitted or incorrect. Commentary has grown stale but with the departure of Erin Andrews maybe EA will have the motivation to revamp it in the booth and not limit it just to the sideline.Certainly an argument can be made that the resources spent on Heisman Challenge could have been put to better use elsewhere. Regardless it should be judged for what it is rather than what could have or even should have been. Heisman Challenge is a fairly inoffensive mode that lacks a compelling hook unless there is emotional attachment to one or more of the players. Even then once inside the mode it becomes a simple game of racking up obscene stats with players that aren't true replications of their past selves and that ultimately overshadows the worthwhile attempt from EA at paying them their due respects.Online Play for NCAA Football 13 can be defined as a strength while still being indicative of the larger problem being faced by the series. Though the game performance is solid, and Online Dynasty remains extremely impressive, the suite of features feels more stale than ever due to a lack variety now having gone five years deep once NCAA 14 is reached without any notable additions.There's value to be had with NCAA Football 13 - there remains a rich array of content and commendable depth to Dynasty mode. However those who play NCAA every year may struggle to identify what exactly would make it a must-have product.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"VG Fan","summary":"Awful, avoid at all costs","reviewText":"Summary = You should NOT buy this game, and also, do not believe that \"it gets really good 20 hours in\" garbage that people always spout, as I explain below.Like many people who played this game, I have to say that it's a pretty huge disappointment.  I ignored the relatively poor rating on Amazon and assumed that people were just being cranky about the new combat system.  I played through about 90 % of this and kept hoping for a big payoff at some point.  I finally realized that there wasn't going to be one and that I'd just wasted 30 hours of my life.  The entire game you spend running down tunnels with different wallpaper fighting incredibly monotonous battles over and over again, then watching really lame cut scenes (the characters in this FF are completely lame with impossibly to decipher motivations for what they are doing).  Especially early on, the battles are always painfully easy, but you have to fight or your characters aren't going to get enough experience and will end up underpowered (in this FF you can actually see the bad guys and can skip some of them if you want).  I don't really mind the new combat system, but it basically requires you to do nothing more than hit X a few times over and over again (unless you are fighting a boss), which makes it really boring.  There are very few city or hub areas, basically no exploration, and very little NPC interaction, which really takes all the character and flavor out of the game.  It's really more of an interactive movie than a game--but a really bad one, with boring characters with nonsensical motivations, and a story that at 90 % of the way through still seems like nonsense.I realize you could say that some of these criticisms apply to all Final Fantasy games (linearity, boring fights), but I liked the other FF games I played (7 and 10).  For example, the ones I've played are also very linear even though they give the illusion of freedom (even the illusion is almost entirely absent here.) Somehow though, the linearity and the monotony of the fighting here is so much worse than ever before.Before I leave I want to address the whole \"well it really hits its stride about 20 hours in\" thing that I always hear.  First of all, a game that takes 20 hours to hit its stride is a horrible game.  It is true that about 20 hours in (roughly 2/3rs of the way through the game I'd guess), you reach a wide open area that you are actually allowed to explore and given some freedom of movement. The only things you can do here are 1) Fight challenges against various boss type enemies (I think you win rewards) and 2) Pick up item orbs and buried treasure--I think it's possible to use a Chocobo to look for buried treasure and to reach some otherwise inaccessible treasure orbs.  I explored a fair amount, but never messed around with the Chocobos and only did a few of the challenges.  There are no NPCs (I mean literally 0 anywhere) or really anything that interesting in this area, except that, like the rest of the game, it's very nice looking.  In order to advance the plot, you have to leave this area and go back to trudging down tunnels fighting stuff.You might even say that the part of the game everyone says \"makes the game better\" is optional, except that you probably need to explore and mess around there for a while to level your characters high enough to comfortably continue.  Clearly, this is not enough to somehow make an awful game good.Obviously it looks amazing, but that's about all it has going for it.Gameplay tip (since I always give one in reviews):- You can't actually level up until a few hours into the game (it will be obvious when).  So until you reach that point, just run by as many enemies as you can because there is no reason at all to fight them.Edit: I have decided that 1 star is too harsh considering that this is a playable, bug free game.  So I'm moving it up to two stars.  But my opinion of it hasn't changed at all.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

You can go full bore and just kill everyone, or there is ways to sneak around, and you can also render guards unconsious if you would rather instead of killing them.  On my first time through, I experimented with several different ways of doing things and I tried out all the various different weapons & abilities, just to get a taste of everything and find out how I most preferred going about things.I only had one main gripe about the game, and it was an ever so small annoyance too: Occasionally trying to chose a weapon or skill from the wheel, (especially as you earn more abilities & such) was sometimes a bit glitchy.  For example, there were times later in the game that I was trying to chose my pistol with the regular shots over this one with explosive rounds and it would give me the pistol with the explosive rounds, and so on.  It was a slight bit frustrating, but fortunately that only happened every once in a while.The game was a little shorter than I was expecting, but then again it would seem short, especially after playing on a game like Skyrim off & on throughout many months.  So don't let that deter you, because the game is actually a decent length...I'd say roughly around 15 hours.  And just because I had no life for 2 days and sat on my arse & played it throughout much of release day and the following Wednesday, lulz.I'd say definitely play it though!  If you like stealth & action mixed in one game with all sorts of player options throughout the game, then I highly recommend checking this game out!  I for one plan to play through it at least a couple more times eventually and try out different means of getting through the game...first time through was just a trial play to get a feel for everything.

And it seems neither was Activision as the developers decided to take the COD franchise in a new directionHello fictional yet modern day warfare!Like most of Call of Duty games. The action is pretty intense and exciting. Never a dull moment. Unlike most COD games, the multiplayer as been changed to be ten times better then previous installmentsThe multiplayer on Xbox live sort of resembles something like Battlefield 2. In which you fight matches and gain xp. The more xp and challenges beat, the more unlockables you can get. And wow are their a lot of unlockables! You can unlock everything from new weapons, new perks, to new multiplayer type games even. Going on a kill streak in a game will allow you to really bring the ownage in terms of calling a helicopter or air strike to rain hell and fury on your enemy. This is of course the difference from previous games. Their are probably millions of ways to kill your enemy in multiplayer and you'll probably want to switch weapons often just to beat the challenges and unlock more stuff.The single player is fun although pretty short. You mostly play as the SAS although their are also a few USMC missions. Like most COD's, it feels like it's you vs an entire army at times. But that is of course the fun of a COD game. The AI is pretty intelligent and will throw back grenades and give a last ditch effort to kill you when they're about to die. The coolest mission is probably the Spectre gunner mission in which you rain death from above on you're enemies, nothing cooler then killing a group of enemies with one shoot from the Spectre cannon. A sniper mission that takes place in Chernobyl is also a fun mission that adds elements of stealth to a pretty much run and gun gameWhen you completed the game you unlock \"Arcade mode\" which takes the single player experience to a whole new level. In this mode you are timed in each mission and have to score as many points as possible. Head shots as well as kill streaks boost your score up while dying and lost of time will hurt it. It allows for some replay if the player isn't interested in multiplayerGraphics and Sound are good as well. Music is kind of repetitive but then again it really won't matter over the sounds of explosions and bullets.All in all..this game is a must have! I can't think of anything bad to say about this game....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2007"}

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare may very well be one of the best first person shooter's you'll ever play on any system, as it features astounding production values and brilliant multiplayer modes on XBox Live.  The graphics and visual presentation are simply gorgeous, as are the spectacular sound effects, which is something the series has always done particularly well.  Controls are sharp and the multiplayer elements make Call of Duty 4 worth picking up alone, but there is one glaring flaw that is unavoidable to notice.  The single player campaign is short, quite short in fact.  You could probably finish the game's single player campaign in an afternoon if you so desired, which is a big time drawback if multiplayer gaming isn't your thing.  If it is your thing though, you'll find it a blast here, and even though the single player campaign is lacking, Call of Duty 4 is still definitely worth picking up.  All in all, Call of Duty 4 is by far the best game in the series yet, and if you're leary of the change of scenery, fear not, war shooters don't get any better than this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2007"}

Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy will always have a soft spot for me because they made me into the RPG fanatic grown up I am today. I bought the FF1 remake on PS1 back when they remade it as Final Fantasy origins and still own it.  But this version sounded interesting and it was $9.99 so I thought 'what the heck'!But I was at first disappointed right away when I noticed that the cost in shops was half what it was in the original.  For example, instead of 100 gil, the spells are 50 gil.  So when before I started with Fighter, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage I could by 2 chain mail, two cloth, weapons for each and then have gil for two spells (usually fire for black mage and Cure for white mage).  This version I had enough gil to almost purchase the max spells for each of the three magic users.  Hmph.The magic system is also different.  You still buy the spells and you have a max of three per magic user per level.  But they use MP instead of the limit of use per spell per level.  This wouldn't be an issue, except that they give you TONS of MP.  So cure costs 4 mp and I have about 70 mp at level 4... sad...The battles are a little easier too it seems.  I find that my characters are hitting better than in the original and getting multiple hits easier.  My red mage was getting 2 hits per attack starting with level 2 or 3!I feel that perhaps SquareEnix wanted to ease off the 'level grinding' that was common with the older RPGs and modernize the game.  Which is fine.  But they totally nerfed the difficulty.  I wouldn't mind if there was an option to change the difficulty settings... but I remember seeing that game over screen quite a few times during my FF1 playing days.If you haven't played the original Final Fantasy, then I would recommend downloading an original NES version ROM and playing through FIRST before playing this version.  This version is nice, and the graphics and music are amazing... but there is really no challenge.  At least not like the original.  If you play the NES version, you will spend a lot of time level grinding and building up gil (unless you do the frost wolf peninsula cheat with Fir2 !).  For extra challenge, try beating FF1 on an emulator without using save states outside of an Inn.  Ahaaaaaaa!  Oh, and the dialogue is pretty odd in parts...  Kind of fun though.Regardless, this is a very good game, and it's a nice dose of nostalgia.  Worth $10, but I wouldn't spend $20+.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}

The music in this game is comparable to that of games played on the PSX, the 32-bit Sony system.  The graphics are also great, 3-dimensional.  Besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile.  It's a long one!  There's so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that it's almost unbelievable.  It's a wonder why I didn't choose this one to be #1 instead of FFII.  I guess it's because in my mind FFII is the one that started the greatness of the FF series.  Since FFII, the FF series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good.  Not to bag on FFI, but the story was rather weak and besides, it was on the 8-bit Nintendo system.  If you have been let down by any Final Fantasy you've ever played, this is the one to play.  There's so many different characters you can get in this game as well, but you have to know how to get them.  My favorite is the Ninja, because he has a mind of his own, and you never know what he's going to say or do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001C6GVI6","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Worthy Chapter in the Persona Series","reviewText":"My main target in this review is to examine the quality of this game for fans of Persona 3. If you want a basic review that looks at this game in isolation then there are plenty of other impressive reviews on this site. It may seem a little harsh to judge the game in comparison to its predecessor, but these games are so unique I can't think of anything else to compare them with. And Persona 4 doesn't come off at all badly in the comparison. No sir. In many ways this is the superior game.First, a question of gameplay and format. This game is divided between fairly standard dungeon crawling and some innovative social gaming tied around the life of a Japanese high school student. The dungeon crawling is a bit repetitive, hindered further by randomly generated dungeons that all look the same. The social gaming is something else entirely. You spend most of your time dealing with time management, dividing your life between schoolwork/social activities and demon fighting. The chance to live out the life of a Japanese teenager is a lot of fun and may leave you with strong flashbacks. I was surprised at how easily I settled back into life as a teenager. Apart from the obvious feeling of control it is hard to explain why this section is such fun. It just is. it's helped by strong side characters and the opportunity to develop stronger relationships with them. Improving your relationships improves your ability to fuse personas of their arcana. This is the same format followed in Persona 3 and, presumably, the upcoming Persona 5. It's hard to argue with success.After the success of Persona 3 this game tried quite hard to make itself unique rather than just a knockoff sequel. To do so it moved the setting from the city to the small country town of Inaba. Everyone knows each other in a small town and this leads to a lot of social stratification. One of the main themes is the gulf between the local kids and those (including you) who moved in from the city. Also moving in from the city is a shopping mall called Junes, which is taking customers away from smaller local stores and causing a lot of resentment. This sort of social commentary was completely absent in Persona 3. A less successful change is the switch from having monsters show up on a full moon to having them show up on foggy days. This feels a bit forced, and makes me hope that future installments will simply list their boss fights in advance so you can better prepare for them. In the end, you usually have about two weeks to complete a castle, but it'd be nice to just have them say that since you don't dare count on it less you run out of time.In another major change the protagonist and his friends are left to discover their abilities by themselves instead of joining a pre-existing team. This leads to a lot of exposition early on that kind of drags the first part of the game. Unlike Persona 3 which gripped me pretty quickly, it took me about fifteen hours to get really into this game. It took over three hours just for the dungeon-crawling segment to appear. By far the biggest change to the game's format is the inclusion of a mystery at the core. There is a serial killer on the loose, who will murder their classmates through supernatural means unless they can stop him. His identity is a closely guarded secret and provides a continual sense of threat. Another major improvement over the last game is the more psychological approach the game takes to the characters. To gain their ability to use personas characters must confront and accept their inner shadow. This shadow is a mirror of them that reflects their innermost secrets and fears. It is a perfect opportunity to see what truly drives these characters. You get to the heart of them in a way that you couldn't just by talking to them.The best aspect of the characters in this game is that who they appear to be on the surface is usually the exact opposite of who they are underneath. The most obvious example of this is Kanji, who appears to be a hard dude of legendary proportions but is secretly gay and confused about his masculinity. Something I've always appreciated about the Persona series is its realistic depiction of friendships. Your initial impression of someone isn't necessarily telling you all there is to know about them and their behavior is different depending on who they're with. They even remember to have traits known to one character but not others. For example, Chie always knew about Yukiko's odd sense of humor because she had been close to her for longer, but when Yukiko started being more open she got a little embarrassed at hearing it in public. And then there are passing moments when you realize that you don't know a character as well as you thought, like when Chie mentions in passing that Yosuke calls her up at night to tell her dirty jokes. Yikes. It's as if these characters have lives that don't always revolve around you.The gameplay has also been improved. Added is the option to control the actions of other characters, which means no more useless game overs because you get hit by a status effect and your teammates are useless. The game still ends if the protagonist gets knocked out, but at least you can reduce your chances of that. There are a few other tweaks to the combat system as well. Now you have to try each different form of attack in order to find out an enemy's weakness. It always seemed a bit cheap to have Yuuka just tell you. Another improvement is the addition of a Defend option, which is so obvious I can't believe that 3 lacked it. Knocking an opponent down is also less effective than in P3 since once they get up they can immediately attack. Fortunately, this applies to your characters as well.The dungeon crawling is still present in excessive amounts, but instead of just going into different floors on one building (Tartarus) each character you rescue has their own castle. These castles all feature essentially the same thing, but they have at least worked on making each new castle feel unique and structured to that character's personality. For example, Yukiko's is basically a prison shaped like her family's hotel while Kanji's is a sauna. They even change the layout of the rooms to better fit the style. Nice. Another plus is that you no longer have to worry about finding a portal every time you want to escape. Instead you use items called Goho-Ms which take you to the entrance. A major difficulty is that the entrance no longer heals you, and paying the fox to do so is reeaally expensive. So your sessions in the TV realm are quite limited in terms of time.Now come the game's few problems. First off, the characters just aren't as memorable as the ones from Persona 3. I quite like Yosuke, Kanji, and some of the others, but Chie is the most annoying character I've seen in this series. It's not just her dialogue, but her voice. I firmly believe in the importance of actors in conveying the tone of a character. Dialogue alone isn't enough to make them bad. Scraping your fingernails on a chalkboard is very irritating for example, but who doesn't love Quint doing it in Jaws? He was just so cool. Here, Chie is both annoyingly written and has an irritatingly high pitched and whiny voice. Her voice is actually the main thing I remember from watching my roommate play this game on the PS2 as she kept screeching \"We're gonna die\" while I was trying to work. It didn't exactly endear the game to me. Most of the other characters are better, but I just miss being in charge of a super-cool team of demon-fighting heroes.An oddity given the game's plot is that it seems rather lighthearted for the Persona series. The lighting is bright and colorful and while the plot goes to some pretty dark places it always returns to the same cheerful world. It's a little bit incongruous with the moodiness inherent in much of the game. The open and communal SEES dormitory, for example, has been replaced with your uncle's cramped house where it's usually just you and your quiet cousin who sits on the floor watching TV since her dad rarely comes home. It feels very lonely and isolated. But then you hit the menu and everything's golden and fine. :-) This is reflected particularly in the character designs from the main character (absurdly cool instead of wannabe hipster) to Teddie (too darn cute). The mystery-centered plot also seems less epic in scale than the end of the world one in Persona 3. It's more focused in that you know the victims personally, but less widespread in that their number is few. This is a more intimate piece and perhaps this is fitting given the small-town setting.I think it's pretty much the characters alone that make me prefer Persona 3. On almost every other level this game is the equal or superior of that one. The plot is compelling, the gameplay superior, the town charming. But the parts that are superior aren't THAT superior, while the bits that don't hold up drag it down a lot worse. Given the social nature of the game character forms a big part, and there just aren't as many characters that I'll keep in my memory. Look at me, whining about how this game isn't Persona 3. It doesn't have to be. It would have ruined both. This is a game that stands on its own and does so well. I respect it for continuing the same gameplay as its predecessor while being completely different in plot and setting. It is in every way a success. The mere fact that people can argue about which is the superior game proves that. If you liked Persona 3 try this. You won't be disappointed. If you like JRPGs or the idea of social gaming appeals to you then try this game. It may be a bit slow to take off for plot reasons, but once it does so it is immensely fun and highly addictive.Is this better thanPersona 3? No. Is it better than 99% of everything else on the market? Yes. Try it.All of the Persona games are also available on portable systems: (Persona,Persona 2: Innocent Sin,Persona 3: Portable, andPersona 4: Golden). Only Persona 3 and 4 have social gaming. The other two are more typical JRPGs with a lot of dungeon-crawling and plot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

The story is well told and has enough twists to keep it interesting. Shooting in this game is smooth and the mechanic's feels very Call of Duty like, which is a good thing. Multiplayer is fun the with very fun games like Wild West Legends, and others. The graphics in multiplayer do not seem as good as the regular game but the fun game settings make up for what may be lacking in the visuals.

Some of the first person animations are a little lacking like when you are running and riding a horse, however overall I would give the graphics a B+.

This is the best portable Resident Evil game I have ever played.  The game has great amount of content for the story mode and with the addition of the Raid Mode, the game is easily over 20 hours.  The graphics are top notch and yes I am not the type that cares much about graphics since it is the overall game that matters more but I did have to mention it since this game incorporates the best graphics on the 3DS.  The standard controls are decent and since I do not own a circle pad pro, I am not able to give feedback for it.  I do have to say that it does feel a bit cramped at that times, but the developers clearly developed this game with portability in mind with the auto-save feature that let's you quit your game in shorter sessions and resume right where you left off.  I was equally impressed with how smooth the game is, though there are times when the game lags a bit but it is bearable.  The story itself is not going to win any awards, but it gets the job done.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game from beginning to end but it was the Raid Mode that got me hooked even more.  This is the mode that incorporates RPG elements which made it quite interesting for a Resident Evil game.  I am still playing the Mode since there are so many missions to complete.  Unlike the mercenaries mode of the past, the Raid Mode is much more fun and challenging since there is no time limit.

Secondly, all the resident evil games that come out for portable game systems suck. For once I thought I was getting a good one and the graphics are a shame. Total let down. And the characters and story are a total let down too. I returned that game and didn't the usual routine from the gamestop employee (would you like to reserve this capcom game?).Capcom sold the \"exclusive rights\" to nintendo shortly before resident evil 4 came out. So the ps2 didn't get remake (but got \"gamecube exclusive resident evil 4\", what?) Result? the sales of kingdom hearts slaughtered the sales of resident evil remake (they probably would have anyway but the mistake still cost capcom money). Remake was the best of all the resident evil games and had the least attention because of a huge money costing deal that capcom made with nintendo. Realizing the mistake, capcom decides it's time to port resident evil 4 (with bonus in game content?) to the ps2 with the graphics it was originally designed for anyway.Since the exclusive rights were originally sold to nintendo, capcom has been letting us down with a lot of titles and canceling work on certain games would buy.  Remake was canceled for another portable system because they are STILL ashamed of what they did to us..... and themselves.Anyway someone reviewed this game and said play call of duty instead! If that is your criticism why don't you bash Halo? And if herbs are a problem, why don't you play games on \"very easy\"...I have played all the previous ones up until remake and some of the ones after, that's why it is still a sore spot today that I could not play Remake when I really wanted to, which were the ps2 days. Capcom can do far better than Revelations if they want to make it up to the once loyal gamers. And if they don't, they will still see what it's like lose money by back-stabbing your fan base.By the way, when does \"Super street fighter X tekken arcade gold edition\" come out?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CX6XKK6","description":"","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"Its a love hate kind of thing..","reviewText":"I have mixed feelings about this game. I really like it but at the same time I really don't . I know that sounds strange but that is how it is.We were all promised something that was going to be leaps and bounds better than the past games and really it feels like a couple steps back.Campaign :I actually enjoyed my playthrough of the campaign and am right now playing through a second time on veteran.. I always go back and play all of my COD games on Veteran because of the huge challenge they pose. Anyway , the story is engaging enough to keep you pulled in the entire time and keeps you wanting to push forwards. This is always a good thing in a game , and this game is like this all the way through.Campaign Graphics :The game looks good , but just doesn't look great. This game is supposed to be running on a new and enhanced game engine , but you know what ? I can't tell !! I actually think Black Ops 2 looked better all the way around and that was running on my 360..Now like I said it is not a bad looking game but you can tell its not quite what it should be.Multiplayer :This is not the best or the worst COD multiplayer to date. In my opinion Modern Warfare 3 is the absolute worst  multiplayer of the whole series..  the developers of this game ( infinityward ) have been falling apart since cod modern warfare ( cod 4 ).. since then its been a down hill slide. Now the other development team Treyarch has really stepped up their game and given us really good COD games every other year. I actually can't wait to see what they bring us in November this year..Bottom line is that you might be disappointed with this game if you drop 50 to 60 bucks on it.. its not bad but at the same time its not as good as previous entries into the series . I will play it from time to time and will beat the campaign on veteran but , I would have waited for the price to drop a bit before I bought it had I known what it was going to be like.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Ker Thao","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"Story was great, sound was great, gameplay was great.

{"product_name":"B008SBZD9G","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"A competent but unoriginal MMORPG","reviewText":"Final Fantasy XIV is a MMORPG in the same vein as some of the best games in the genre like Rift and World of Warcraft, and while it is not all that much worse than those games, I didn't find anything done much better here than there. This is basically a \"me too\" game that offers most of what the competition does, but falters in some basic ways. If you are brand new to this type of game, add one star to my review. I will be using some acronyms that are widely accepted amongst fans of these games, so my apologies to any newcomers who have to use Google to figure out what I'm talking about.Pros:-The crafting system is slightly innovative with actual crafting classes that you switch to and level up, learning active crafting skills along the way. These skills are used while you craft to determine how good the items turn out. Intelligent use of skills allows higher quality items to be synthesized.-The class system allows learning of many classes on one character.-There are many different methods of gaining experience, from storyline quests to frequent world events called Fates, to just hunting certain monsters found in a log book.-Storyline elements feel more like a regular RPG and sometimes have spoken dialogue and cutscenes.-It is usually clear where you're supposed to go-Much more user-friendly than other Japanese MMORPGs, including FFXI, though FFXI fans may actually dislike this game for how it bends to popular conventions.-I thought it was cool as a melee class that some skills differentiate between an enemy's flank and an enemy's back, so you had to decide which skill to use based on where you were standing relative to the monster, or move around during combat to use different skills more effectively.Cons:-The crafting system, while innovative, still feels like a chore, and the ability to enhance and socket items into gear requires asking friends for help or personally mastering nearly every single trade.-The class system requires you to level up many different classes just to switch to other, special classes. Want to be a Dragoon like Kain from Final Fantasy IV? You have to first level up one class to 30 and another to 15 before you can switch.-You're basically forced into doing the storyline quests. Most people won't mind, but it stinks in a MMORPG when you can't access basic functions in the game without doing the story. Want to sell the stuff you crafted? Progress the storyline to about 10 hours in.-The auctions are managed through a weird system of hiring a \"retainer\" and as I just mentioned above, this is not available without unlocking it. Why not just list items for sale at an auction house like every other game?-World events are not at all random and are so frequent that it's almost annoying. Most of the objectives are just killing a horde of enemies, and they may not be possible to solo, though the game will not indicate whether or not you should have a group to do them. The game Rift at least gave some indication of the level of difficulty for a given world event.-The dungeons fit fewer people and actually have less room for DPS than the competition. A typical dungeon is only 2 DPS, 1 tank and 1 healer. As you would expect, the queue time for being a DPS is massive. Why would anyone design a game from the ground up in 2013 that didn't take the tank/healer issue into account? Other games have a major lack of tanks and healers, but FFXIV is on a whole new level with queue issues, and that will likely never be solved.-The World is not always seamless even within the same general region. You will be moving from area to area just like you do in regular Final Fantasy games. There is not even the illusion of a unified world.-Almost every skill seemed to be on the same cooldown for the classes I played. There were a few long-cooldown moves, but there was no heavy-hitting instant cast skill on a 10 second cooldown or anything like that. My rotation was just hitting a skill, waiting a second, hitting another skill, waiting a second, etc. The feel of most of the classes is a lot more dull than what Rift or Warcraft offer.-Customer service is pretty much nonexistent even months after launch.-There is not even the ability to block or report spammers, and you can't play without being spammed by bots and gold sellers. The only way to block people is manually typing their name into your blacklist. If you don't block the person, you'll spend your entire session being spammed over and over by the same person. Why not just have a block option from a menu when you click their name like WoW has had for a decade?-Typical boring endgame that will just feel like work after a week or so. No large raids to do and PVP is an afterthought. In fact, at the time of my writing this there is no PVP, though it's supposedly coming. It will be instanced small group skirmishes, if I am not mistaken. Certainly it's nothing like what the competition offers and likely will never be, as there is no such thing as a PVP server.All in all I would recommend that MMORPG fans try the game for the price it's at, but most of the fun of the game for veterans of the genre is going to be the newness of it. Once the honeymoon is over, you won't find anything new here that you didn't already get bored with in other games that have been on the market for years.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Battlefield and Call of Duty.  Sure there are some other guys out there like Halo, but these 2 games are what people are playing if you want modern weapons based in real world type maps.I like COD and have played them all, but this game is so much fun because it is so much different.  The COD games are fun because they play and feel like an arcade game. Sometimes you want more realism and rounds where strategy is more important that twitch reflexes.  COD games seem to reward those that can play with high sensitivities over strategy.  I would like to state that I do really well on COD games, but I still find it a tad silly that someone can 360 spin 5x and then no scope sniper kill you when you have a sub machine gun within a 15 foot range.  Still fun, but can sometimes be frustrating.  This BF game gives you plenty of realism is big open maps.  You are rewarded more for team work and strategy than who can aim the fastest.  Sure speed of aiming is apart of it, but not the main factor in determining skill.  I'm going to give one very cool scenario a friend and I did on BF that hasn't compared to any other game we've ever played.A good tank driver kept messing our team up at a certain point.  My friend went support with C4.  I went assault.  When the tank came back to the point we had just capped to take us out I climbed on top of a building and started shooting the tank trying to get his attention.  As he was swinging his big gun up there to blow me up my friend came out of the bushes on the other side of the tank and placed C4 on him and blew him up before he could shoot me!!!  You don't get that type of reward for team work in most games, but you can and do with BF3!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

The heavily occupied nazi areas are a glossy black and white, while the other areas not as heavily occupied are color.  As you progress through the game you change the areas to color.The gameplay is very fun.  Driving cars is fun.  You can drive any one and they are fun and fast to control.  You can run, jump, stealth, punch, kick, drive, climb buildings, shoot, and set demolitions.You control Sean an Irish regular guy much like most of us.  He meets with various resistance people and performs missions.  I will not tell about the missions or story as you should experience them yourself.  Also since I am only 10hrs into it I don't know everything.  Anyway the story and missions so far are really good and fun.The game can be quite challenging once the nazis are alerted that you are a sabotuer.  To help this you can melee attack with fists or kicking using stealth and being undetected and wear any nazis uniform.  Or you can go in blazing which is tough.  Anyway there are different approaches you can use.  You can always climb buildings.  But sooner or later the nazis are alerted and you have to go in blazing and it is quite challenging the ai is very relentless and good.  After the missions you will have to outrun the nazis or when ever you are detected and want to not be.  Then you have to either run or drive out side of the circle on the mini map that the nazis are chasing you.  There are also a lot of targets to blow up and I will not spoil any but there are hundreds if not thousands.  The map is big and there it is a really cool world.  You can map out your location when driving so you can follow a marker on the mini map that is always shown at the bottom of the screenAlso which is cool when you finish missions or blow up targets you get black market currency where you can buy weapons or cars and you can even get upgrades that will improve your abilities.anyway in conclusion.  This is a very fun game with great graphics, a great story and characters, great action gameplay, fun driving, great controls, and Sean can do anything you would ever want a person to do.  I mean as in running , jumping, driving, etc.  Usually in a game they don't have an action you wish they did.  In this one I thought they covered all the bases for a character. I haven't noticed any bugs.  I read a review on the xbox 360 version where a guy said it had bugs like floating cars only in the first 2 hrs of play, but I have been on the ps3 version for 10hrs and not noticed any bugs.  And have even stopped playing uncharted 2 because I am having more fun with this.I plan on finishing the review after I finish the game just wanted to give my 2 cents for up to now.Kevin**updated on Dec 28th 2009.Just finished the game missions 100% didn't do hardly any free play targets.  Anyway I loved the game.  Very cool story.  Which includes the character and missions.  The missions are very varied and as the nazis get stronger you can also purchase stronger weapons.  It seems that the game is always progressing and your character along with it so while the missions are challenging, you are able with the right approach to finish them.  Some of the missions took me a few trys to get through but I enjoyed the game enough to keep trying.  Sometimes I thought too hard but just aproached it a different way.  Kinda of cool you have to think in an action approach instead of a puzzle approach.  I didn't ever wonder what to do as I think the missions are very well layed out.  You just think how to finish them without getting killed rather than what am I supposed to do.  One of the races took me all night to win.  But was super fun and exciting!  Some of the missions had so much action on the screen a lot of times I was just smiling and I was very engroused with the action.  I didn't have any time playing that wasn't exciting.  All in all the most fun game I have played right up the with mercs 2.  I didn't notice any bugs and would call this my game of the year.  Also some of the cars you can get when you start racing are sweeeeeet!Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}

The assassin creeds bundle is worth every cent. You get the following: a crystal white ps vita limited edition system, the assassin creed 3 liberation game, and a 4gb memory stick. Now if you was lucky to get this on Black Friday, you received more. The reason I did not buy this at launch was because I was broke. I did not want the 3ds due to flaws with the system. So I decided that when I get the money ill get the vita instead. Now a lot of people are saying that the vita does not have many games (ill get to that a LIL later) now if you have second thoughts on getting the ps vita let me put that to rest. THE PS VITA IS THE BEST HANDHELD GAMING SYSTEM EVER!!! The boot time is fast, the system is very light, you get 2 analog sticks, the system uses cartridges in stead of Umds, is completely silent, it has 2 touch screens, one in the front and the other in the back,2 cameras, one front and one back. You get apps such as Netflix,Facebook,YouTube,etc. THE SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL, a five inch screen oled display .This has to be the most absolutely best screen ever on a portable gaming console. Makes 3ds screen look like crap. Now the software is unlike anything I've seen, kinda like an ipad, and just as smooth as an ipad. Everything is intuitive,fast, and easy to learn. You will tell yourself this cannot be a psp, it works and feels nothing like its brother. Now for the games. People are all saying that 3ds has more games, well yes that's obvious, the 3ds was out a whole year before the vita was release. But don't be disappointed, the vita has great games, uncharted, rayman,wipeout,mortal kombat,gravity rush, ultimate marvel vs capcom. These games are crazy fun, and look so good on the vita you won't believe your eyes. Not only does the vita offer the launch games, you can access to the ps store where you will find tons of games, psp games, ps one games, ps minis,etc.I was completely shock how great this system is, I was just like you, I didn't know whether to buy it but I'm very happy I did. Now there are some bad points, like the memory cards are very expensive but you will need one to play anygame, the battery is ok, not great,but still good. You still get those stupid ps manteniece. But at the end of the day playing games on this thing is great and addictive, the games look beautiful, and everything runs smoothly.

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The best handheld system just keeps getting better","reviewText":"Believe it or not, the GameBoy has been around for nearly 15 years.  It has outlasted the Super Nintendo, the Genesis, the Game Gear, the Saturn, the Nintendo 64, and a few other systems.  Over that time we have seen the original GameBoy, the Pocket version, and the GameBoy Color, and now the GB has made the leap from 8-bit to 32-bit, and the results are outstanding.  The processing horsepower of the GBA makes it possible to play games like Doom, Mario Kart, Tekken, and the Tony Hawk series (in full 3-D I might add) without skipping a beat.  The screen is wider than before, eliminating some problems with seeing the screen (though no proper lighting remains a big drawback), and the system is compatible with all 500 plus previously released GameBoy games.  Best of all, you can toggle on and off the regular size screen for old GB games with the widescreen mode adding new dimensions to an old game.  You can also link it up with other players with a Game Link (tell me playing a Doom deathmatch on a GameBoy isn't cool), and with new games on the horizon like Wolfenstein 3-D, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and the new Spider-Man, the GBA looks to have a bright future.  However, not all the games for the GBA use the GBA to its' full advantage; Tony Hawk 2 &amp; 3, Doom, and Tekken utilize the full 3-D power, but other games like NHL 2002 and Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX look like 16-bit games.  Thats only a small complaint however, the GBA is a great system, and you should stop reading this and buy one now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2002"}

The gameplay is good for stealth, but it is better for action. The plot is interesting as well, and I think the final level really brings it up nicely.

To get that over with, it's really not as bad as the insane backlash would have you believe. I didn't love any of the endings, but found something to like about each of them. (I discovered four different endings on my initial playthrough, after having downloaded the \"extended cut.\") The first 99% of the game is an absolute blast. Having played through the previous iteration, ME3 had a far more compelling and fast paced story. There were only about half as many squadmates as in the previous title, but it was okay, because I found the gameplay better and got to know each character more intimately.So... the ending(s). They seemed like they came from some other game.SPOILERS:It was quite literally a deus ex machina in a series that has mostly depended on player choice. An enigmatic ghost child appears and gives you three choices (four if you refuse to choose). But none could be called a \"happy ending.\" If you don't have enough \"effective military strength,\" Shepard will not survive no matter what you do.Anyway; besides the ending, the game had a surprisingly fun and addictive multiplayer. It let me experiment with different classes without having to slog through the single player campaign again.Overall, it's a great value. Don't let the disproportionate backlash to the ending stop you from buying this (especially if you can get it for under $20). I spent more than 100 hours (two playthroughs and multiplayer), and I look forward to more adventures in the Mass Effect universe.BTW, buying new allows free access to online multiplayer.

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"I like it","reviewText":"I was skeptical at first about buying this (I don't rent games anymore). I have the first 2 and love them both but for some reason I just didn't have that urge to want to purchase this game. The professional review I went to gave it an 8 out of 10 which really didn't help with my purchasing decision. Usually I will only pay $60 for a game if its a 9 or better.I watched about the first 7 minutes of gameplay on youtube and decided to buy it. Actually I didn't buy it, I traded in 2 games that recently came out that I just could not get my self to play anymore (*cough halo4 and blops 2 cough*) and those two games, believe it or not, was enough to pay for the entire game including tax. If dead space 3 does suck, at least I didn't spend any of my more recent earned money :/The graphics are really good. No surprises there. I love the lighting as always. The controls are pretty much the same as DS2 except now you can duck and roll which is somewhat handy especially on harder difficulties. You have to press and hold the RS stick in order to use the way point.The sound effects are really good too. The devs seem to want to create a game that is more action packed than horror almost. It just doesn't have the scary feel that 1 and 2 had. Especially part one. Usually when one monster comes at you in this game a LOT more are followed soon after. After you kill 'em all there are no more enemies for a little while and it does this throughout the whole game. The game is longer though too.To be honest I don't really have a problem with the few differences in gameplay. The storyline, just like in 2, kinda sucks but at least they kept with the theme. The weapon crafting system is something that you will have to get used to as you play the game. Once you get the hang of it, it makes the game really good. I don't have a second player so I can't play co-op. Nor do I have kinect.Overall its a good game with a really high replay value. You unlock more modes after you beat it once. I recommend that you rent it first though. I got lucky and ended up liking this game a lot even though I thought I wouldn't. If you must buy then try to catch it when its around $40 or less. Its not a bad game but it is a little different and that is what may turn some diehard fans of the first 2 off.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}

This has been well recieved by critics and rightly so.GRAPHICSThe graphics are great and use cell shading (dark cloud 2, wild arms 3) to excellent effect. The character designs are superb and fit perfectly with the personalities of all the people/creatures in the game such as the sexy redhead Jessica. Also all weapons and some armour will actually show up on the characters which is a nice touch. All the environments are good as well and there is a real feeling of it being a living breathing world.9/10SOUNDOne of the strongest aspects of the game is the superb music and voice acting. The music is done by a highly skilled orchestra and it sounds great, and fits the mood of a particular scene very well. The voice acting is brilliant and the use of British voice actors was a stroke of genius. All the voice acting is great, nothing sounds forced and there is real emotion behind the words. As such the atmosphere is never lost or diminished.9/10GAMEPLAYThe game is set in a third person perspective and plays much like a cross between wild arms and dark cloud. The battles are random (but the encounter rate is balanced), and the fighting is traditional turn based style. It's decent and you can learn many skills and wield a number of weapons. It's also quite hard, as enemies can often wipe you out in one or two rounds, and much of your time will be spent levelling up and getting better skills and equipment.You have to visit a church to find out how far to the next level up and to save the game (Like the classic phantasy star). This can be irritating at first as it means backtracking, although you can quickly get the skills that allow you to teleport instantly. If someone in your party is reduced to 0HP then they die, the vast majority of RPGs have you simply falling unconcious. This is not a good aspect of the game, as you cannot lose, because even if your party is all killed you wake up at the church, albeit with half your gold taken away. It seems foolish to have dead companions in your party when it would have made more sense to have them fall unconsious like 99% of rpg's.It's also nice how you can vist the battle status screen and check how many battle have been fought, max damage etc, and your travelling party leader gives you comments and criticism. There is also a large number of monsters and a good library to look at.  Especially impressive is the variety of monsters and their atacks, some will try to defeat you with brute force, some will use only spells, others will have many different techniques needed to beat them, and others still will use their good looks to prevent you from attacking them!The interaction between you and the party members is good,and you can talk to them at any time and their conversations always change depending on where you speak to them. Although this is another rpg that has a silent hero, which isn't that good as he should have a voice, because he clearly speaks to people. Also you name the character, which in an rpg with spoken dialogue has no point, because people should call you by one name only.There are a number of mini games such as the Casino, the monster collecting/arena etc. You can also make alot of custom items with the alchemy pot which is a great addition to the game. There is plenty to do besides the main quest.9/10OVERALLThis is a solid rpg with a traditional combat style, and great music/voice acting. Given the number of disappointing rpg's released recently this is a welcome change. Certainly worth buying and a great experience. Best RPG of the year 2005. There's a reason this sold over 3 million copies in Japan alone, people know quality when they see it!9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2005"}

He declared himself dictator of Pandora, and remodeled the city after his own ego. As you and your fellow Vault Hunters enter Pandora, Jack tries to blow you up.  Throughout the game he constantly insults you!  He's more full of douchebaggery than the entire cast of Archer. You must take down Jack and restore 'relative' order to Pandora. On your mission, you'll meet all sorts of 'Violently Psychotic Redneck-Type Characters'; and they're hilarious.Gameplay: 9/10Go to town, get some quests, head out into the wastes, and kill stuff. Then, get the loot, sell it, get better weapons, upgrade your character and kill more stuff. Play solo or with friends!The shooting mechanics are similar to Call of Duty where one trigger zooms, and the other fires. Your characters get special attacks and stat upgrades that are upgradeable through a skill tree. You can also carry very customizable grenades. You'll fight through hordes of enemies, sub-bosses, and some pretty powerful main bosses. The AI is pretty straightforward. Enemies will charge at you, some take cover and shoot, and some have powerful abilities.If your HP reach zero, you don't die immediately. Instead, you fall to the ground. If you can kill any enemy before you bleed out (via timer) you are revived with some shields and some health. Or a party member can aid you, so you don't have to die, respawn, and lamely run back to the battle in shame.Upgrades and Loot: 10/10Borderlands is famous for its weaponry. There are different weapon types: Pistol, Submachine Gun, Shotgun, Rifle, Sniper Rifle, and Rocket Launchers. They all have randomly generated stats and special perks: Damage, Accuracy, Fire Rate, Reload Time, Magazine Size, Special Damage Type, Damage per second, and chance for that special damage type to affect enemies. (Fire guns make the enemies catch fire.)There are different types of guns best suited for the types of enemies that you face. Electric guns are great against shields, Fire is especially good against flesh, Corrosive is great against armor, and explosive hurts every enemy type.Grenades and Shields also have a ton of statistics and perks. Grenade modifications include the way they are deployed, their damage, their explosive radius, and damage type. Shields have a damage absorb, a delay to recharge, and a speed in which it recharges as well as extra perks like damage reflect, absorb ammo, Max Health Increase...The beauty of this system, is that you'll always have pretty good guns for any given situation, but you'll always want better guns. So, if you have a super awesome rare shotgun with corrosive damage, you will own all enemy robots at close range. But if you have to engage enemy snipers or rocket troops, you'll be at a disadvantage. If you pick up a sniper rifle with fire damage, you'll do much better. As you progress to the harder areas of the game, even your favorite gun will need to be swapped out for something better.You start the game, with 2 quick swap gun slots and a backpack so you can carry more guns. Throughout the game, you can upgrade up to 4 gun slots by leveling up.Borderlands 2 also features a special currency that allows you increase the Maximum amount of Ammo that you can carry for each gun and the amount of items in your backpack. This currency is extremely valuable and you appreciate it when you find it.There are two types of vehicles in the game, too. You can spawn 2 at a time and teleport directly to them. Vehicle combat is kind of fun, but definitely takes a back seat to the running and gunning.Graphics: 9/10Who needs Assassin's Creed Graphics, when you've got style? Borderlands 2 isn't the best looking game, but it has style. It looks like a graphic novel come to life. Because the game doesn't take itself seriously and it's really fun, the graphics help create a fun environment.Sound: 10/10The voice acting, battle effects, and soundtrack are all GREAT!Maturity: MThis is like an ultra-violent graphic novel with sick humor. It's not for kids. It's perfect for older teens, though.Replay Value: 10/10The game has 4 Playable Characters, it's Single Player or Co-Op, and it will take 30-50 hours to finish, depending on how many side quests that you do. Once you finish, you unlock a New Game+ mode where you can play it again on a tougher difficulty, but keep your current weapons and continue leveling up. Borderlands 2 is selling for $10-$20 right now and that's a great deal!Overall: 10/10If you just want to have a great time shooting bad guys, upgrading your character, and laughing at twisted jokes, then this is the game for you! The shooting does get a bit repetitive after a while, but it's easy to forgive the game when a slain enemy drops a powerful weapon that rounds out your arsenal. You'll get at least 30 hours of fun for less than a dollar an hour!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2014"}

The reason I bought it because I was actually lining up for the Wii for my cousin, and finally after 1 hour of standing and chatting I decided to get the xbox 360 elite too because there were 2 consoles left out of 6 and Mass Effect is my console buyer.I own all three systems, and I can tell you that currently, my most favorite system is XBOX 360 with Rainbow 6 Vegas, Crackdown, Gears of War, Condemned, Dead Rising, and Splinter Cell Double Agent.  All the games are much more interesting than PS3 games and Wii games.  The reason is because of XBOX LIVE Online games!  Wii does not have online game, while PS3 has to force developers to have their own server, in case if the video game developer decide to shut it down, gamers will never able to play online, while Live is always Online.  Difference between FREE and $5/month.  Moreover, PS3's online feature is still not developed well yet, I guess we have to wait till HOME rolls out to re-judge PS3.Price of hardware Elite vs PS3:XBOX 360 ELITE has the following hardware and accessories:xbox360 black consolewired headsetHDMI cableComponent + Composite Cable120GB HDDBlack Wireless Controller with Rumble Featuretotal $479.99PS3 Specs:60GB HDDBlu-RAY ROMMulti-Memory Card ReaderWIFIWireless Li-ION battery inside the 6 Axis Controller with no Rumble FeatureComposite CableHDMI OUT no HDMI cable nor Component Cable.Total $599.99Lets add a $10 not even HDMI 1.3 version cable for $9.99Official Component Cable for $29.99Upgrade the HDD with a 120GB for $99.99PS3 Total Price: $739.96* HDMI v1.3 cost $59.99 by SONY or $100 by Monster Cable* PS3 user can use any kind of SATA notebook hardware on PS3, so upgrade your own when you see a dealLet's Customize the XBOX 360 to PS3 specs to direct compete with each other OFFICIALLY excluding any ebay or bargain deals on hardware/accessories:XBOX 360 ELITE PACKAGE: $479.99xbox 360 WIFI adaptor: $99.99HD-DVD: $199.99Rechargeble Battery Pack + USB charger: $19.99Total: $799.96So XBOX 360 with 120GB HDD is $799.96 VS PS3 $739.96 also customized with a 120GB.However, to conventional gamers, they only care about games, the HD-DVD ROM becomes an optional accessories; moreover, a lot of people decide to use the Ethernet cable instead.  Moreover, since M$ really want to promote VoIP, so each Premium or ELITE system has a wired headset for you to communicate; therefore, the xbox 360 final price becomes:$499.98  And that's the BASIC setup for ONLINE GAMEING.M$ should elimate the Core system to prevent customers confusion and being ripped off.  A core system for $299.99 is basically a ripped off because user can't just use the core system to play online games or access/download any free online contents. It's lacking component cables for $29.99, Headset for $19.99, a Wireless Controller $10 more than wired one for 4 players games, and most importantly, the HARDDRIVE for game data storage.Those core system users however, have the option to choose between two categories of memory: Proprietory Memory Unit, and Proprietory HDDa 512MB Memory Unit cost $49.99 with a free live acarde game included. Again is a total ripped off.a 20GB Harddrive which is 40x larger than the 512MB cost $99.99 officially.If they are knowledgeable and really need to play games that uses a lot of saves and go XBOX LIVE, they would definitely choose 20GB or 120GB HDD.Honestly, 20GB is basically not enough, because you only get around 10 or 7 GB actual free space after setting it up, but you can free up some space from the default contents.  A demo game or expansion pack usually is 600MB to 1.2GB.  Plus if you plan on renting HD movies via XBOX LIVE, all the moviesd are at least 3-4GB.M$ is actually smart that let you DOWNLOAD HD-MOVIES instead of forcing customers to pay for HD-DVD ROMS.  DOWNLOAD movies is the future, not distributing optical media.In conclusion:XBOX 360 is actually more expensive than PS3.  However, due to M$ \"smart\" optional system.  Those who don't want the extra features can decide not to pay for it.  XBOX360 ELITE is actually a good option for those new comers like me.  It has the most important Accessories for gamers: 120GB Harddisk, more than enough for current games + expansion packs.  But don't forget M$ and SONY are directly competing to each other.  It's not hard to imagine once SONY PS3's  HOME rolls out to the market, M$ will definitely response to that.  Also games are starting to get larger and larger.  Games like Resistance Fall of Man from PS3 is already 17GB using blu-ray disc, XBOX 360 game Blue Dragon has used up 3 DVDs.  Grand Theft Auto IV due to massive amount of data streaming, a Harddisk is needed for efficiency.  XBOX 360 Core that's lacking a Harddisk is actually a challenge to developers.My Opinion is XBOX 360 still don't need to have HD-DVD ROM, instead, they should ELIMINATE THE CORE SYSTEM so EVERYBODY GETS EQUAL CHANCE TO RENT HD-DVD MOVIES and download them to their HARDDISK!!!!!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Time for innovation:  FFXIII-2 suffers from \"Maddenitis\"","reviewText":"Chief among most people's complaints of franchise games is Madden NFL, where they slap a couple coats of shiny paint on it, maybe add an additional mode, and release it to what amounts to a $60 roster update every year.  And millions of people buy it.But there is a BIG difference between millions of NFL fans and an RPG series.To be blunt, Square-Enix has missed the boat miserably over the past 2 years, first with Final Fantasy XIII and then their horrendous rollout of FFXIV, which is now back in development and may never see the light of day on the PS3.FFXIII, I personally didn't have too much of a problem with.  However, many others did and vowed never to play another FF again.  It was a bold risk, departing from everything the FF series was known for, and in some ways it succeeded (mainly in the adjustment to the battle system).  In others, it utterly failed (on rails for 20+ hours, party leader dying ends up being an instant game over (however, I will point out in other FF games, namely FFVI, there were sections where if a particular party member died it was game over as well, it wasn't a new concept to FF), and the weapon leveling system, while a good idea, was way over the head of all but the diehard FF's.So FFXIII-2 has set out to right all those wrongs, and while it has somewhat, it too seems like a \"shiny coat of paint\" versus any real innovation:- Weapon leveling replaced by Monster improving, ala \"Pokemon\"- The battle system does Paradigm Shift faster, but is basically the same from FFXIII except for the \"wounded\" effect, and that only really causes a problem against big bosses, not normal enemies- On top of that, you're not going to NEED to shift out of Relentless Assault all that often if you spend your time leveling up early on.  That's a major problem, and was not the case in FFXIII, which forced you to know and use all the roles against normal enemies as well.- The story.  Really?  I thought FFXIII's was hard to follow, but this seems like something Star Trek would pull, not Final Fantasy.  The greatest FF's (VII, IV, VI, X) had VERY in depth and easy to follow stories which had awesome twists and turns.  This is more like \"traveling through time to get to Lightning\" and well, the rest makes zero sense.FFXIII-2 looks great, sounds great, but I'm ready for another angle.  Why is it so hard to take what made IV, VI, VII and X so great, and put that into a next-generation title?Pros:- Fixes the linearity issues of FFXIII- A collector's dream, as there's plenty to discover and findCons:- Absent a coherent storyline- Battles are simply too easy except near the end of the game- No connection to the characters and their mission, an RPG killerSo while it may have improved on FFXIII, I still see this as nothing better than an average RPG effort for a next-gen system, especially when you consider titles like Skyrim (and the upcoming Kingdom of Amular: Reckoning) have doing a fantastic job in creating a larger than life setting where your actions affect everything and you feel part of that world.And as others have mentioned, if you haven't played FFXIII, the story will make zero sense to you.If you're a diehard FF fan you'll buy this anyway.  For others, I strongly suggest going with Skyrim or Kingdom of Amular: Reckoning.  Or dust off your PSP and replay FFIV, VI, VII and/or Crisis Core to find out how a great FF game is meant to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2012"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons. Just as in the single-player mode, multiplayer games will feature dynamic elements, making each session unique.You can explore the world of Far Cry 2 from inside a car or flying on a glider.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Severly lacking in greatness.","reviewText":"Far Cry 2 is certainly not a bad game.  There are aspects that are done very well, and others that completely missed the mark.  The result is typical of many next-gen games -- tremendous potential, but fell miserably short of hitting the target.Let's start with the good aspects.  Most obvious is the map -- the game world.  It's massive.  It's diverse in its landscapes and it's the embodiment of the free roaming feature that many games aspire to.  Then comes the FPS part.  Each gun feels very unique and combat is fun and realistic (as if I've ever been in actual combat).There are other things that are done very well.  Far Cry 2 probably has the best fire system in any game.  Also, the way you approach a task with regard to strategy is completely up to you, although you will probably end up finding your particular strategy and sticking to it the entire game.  Personally I chose a stealthy sniper.The rest of the game is pretty bad starting with the voice acting.  It's absolutely horrendous.  I'm usually not a critic of voice acting, but in Far Cry 2, it's so bad that you can't ignore it.  It's like the exclamation point stressing how little they cared about story in this game because the story is just a murder delivery system rather than an entertaining part of the game.Then comes travel.  I find it interesting that the best aspect of this game, the massive world, is also the most tedious aspect.  It wouldn't be such a big deal if EVERYone didn't try to kill you (and I mean everyone) and checkpoints didn't repopulate enemies after a few minutes of you clearing them out.  On top of that, your character is no track star.  You can only run for about 30 paces before you tire out.  That makes traveling around without a vehicle that much more tedious.  Your character is also incapable of climbing anything, which makes no sense.Now, when it comes to video games, what makes them fun is that all the little annoyances of reality are left out.  For example, you don't have to go to the bathroom or eat.  It's just assumed that it happens.  In Far Cry 2, they included many of these annoyances.  Your character has Malaria and goes into fits of yellow fever every now and then.  Why?  Why?!!  Also, you have to whip out a map when you want to see where you are going.  There's no mini-map.  Then there's the whole jamming guns thing, which is actually fine because it becomes a non-issue later in the game when you buy good weapons and upgrade them, but still an example of odd choices that take away from the fun.I mean, because if we're being completely realistic, then you wouldn't be able to use your map when you go in the water because your GPS is not waterproof.  And you wouldn't be able to heal bullet wounds with a pair of pliers and some magic health injections.Then comes the game.  Far Cry 2 is an FPS that strives to have RPG elements, but it's ridiculous.  You basically walk around Africa and murder everyone you see because everyone you see, if not specifically related to the story, is trying to kill you.  They see you driving past them at high speed, they shoot.  There's no discretion.  They just kill everything.  It makes the game rather one dimensional.  I mean, how the hell do they know that you're the enemy if you are driving in their car?  Please.So, when it comes down to it, Far Cry 2 is little more than a fire and murder simulator.  If you pass on this game, you're not missing much.Then to top it off, you lose all of your Safe House Upgrades mid-game and you have to get them all over again.  It was at that point that I returned the game to Gamefly.  I didn't even bother with the multiplayer because I have Gears of War 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2009"}

Though some might argue that it depends on what difficulty you're playing on, but I'd like a game to be fun and immersive to everyone on any level, you know worth the money you spent on it. That being said Call of Duty: World at War falls short. I overly enjoyed the fact that you played in both theatres of World War II, but I hated how it compressed the entire war into 14-15 missions. This had so much potential to be a truly epic WWII fps. The gamplay is standard for the COD series, and like the other ones, with some controlla adjustmens, became very intuitive. The online play is also cliche, and has its moments too. Now where I think this game shines isn't the campaign or the online muitiplayer, but Nazi Zombies. I was blown away by it. Not by the graphical presentation, not by anything of the nature, but by how fun it is. That may not be much to say, but in a day and age where technical achievments are almost held higher than fun gameplay, it shines in my book.

Corporation to ignite a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without color.Join the revolutionde Blob dripping with green.View larger.Hopping around in Chroma.View larger.Prof leads the 'Color Revolution'.View larger.de Blob running out of paint.View larger.Battle against massive tank battalions, speedy I.N.K.T. racers and elite Inky soldiers on your quest to free the citizens of Chroma City. Avoid hot plates, electric shocks and inky turrets to create your own path to the impenetrable I.N.K.T. Fortress. Just remember that the struggle to reclaim Chroma City is to be fought on your terms. Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation to launch a revolution and save Chroma City from a future without vibrant color.Long Live Color!- Join the Color Revolutionaries in the resistance against the evil Comrade Black and his diabolical array of hot plates, electric shocks, and ink turrets.Free the Citizens- Free your friends from a black and white world by dodging ink cannons, flattening I.N.K.T. tanks and outsmarting Inky soldiers.Save your City- Remix Chroma City&rsquo;s towering skyscrapers, expansive bridges and massive landmarks in your own style using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks.Make a Mess- Super-size your blob as you splash, spray, and splatter everything you touch in sprint, race and combat challenges.Multiplayer- Compete for control as ink levels rise and wind cannons fire in eight multiplayer-specific gameplay modes.Plenty of Play Modesde Blobfeatures both a deep story-driven singleplayer mode where players get to dig into the Raydian's struggle against all-powerful I.N.K.T. Corporation, as well as a diverse range of multiplayer options. These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow. With time limited it's a race not only to paint the town but also to keep opponents from doing the same.","reviewerName":"L","summary":"Good Wii game","reviewText":"I enjoyed de Blob which was refreshing considering the lack of actual good titles on the Wii. There are definitely good games but you have to dig through quite a few bad ones to find them. The music and style here is unique, and you simply move your character around painting the town with color. It somewhat reminded me of Katamari Damacy on PS2.I notice there are many low scoring reviews from parents who had too young of a child trying to play this game. These reviews are unfair and you shouldn't let it sway you from trying de Blob. Those parents should check out the piles of younger games on Wii because this one is actually good for adults AND kids out of training pants.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2010"}

There are so many fun things to do with this game besides the main missions! You can frisk any and every person on the street for drugs or illegal weapons--though you might tick a few off enough to fight you! If you get to certain parts of town (the rougher neighborhoods) you can just stand there and watch the street crimes happen around you! And it's your choice as to how to stop them. If you take the people down and arrest them, you earn a \"Good Cop\" rating, but if you choose to just blow them away, you earn a \"Bad Cop\" rating. While this doesn't affect gameplay much, it will affect the ending of the game. The missions are fairly linear, but it's the \"between mission\" activities that set this game apart. You can go to the gym and improve your fighting skills (you can't do much to start out with), or go to the shooting range to get better weapons with your score (and don't expect to just walk in and start shooting-some of the targets fire back!). You're going to have to remember where everything is though, because you might have a hard time finding a hospital/first-aid station when you're really needing one in the 200+ miles of LA you're driving through. If you enjoy GTA, this is definitely one to buy. The cars handle differently, so if you're chasing a perp in a stolen vehicle, you'd better think twice before commandeering a limo to chase them with! One warning: the language here is serious, so it easily earns it's \"M\" rating. The only other major gripe with this game is the camera angles. You could be fighting several guys at once and have your character all of the sudden staring at the camera with no enemy in sight. And try chasing a mugger down the street when you can't even see what's going on! By the time you adjust the camera to get behind your character again, it's too late. A single button reset would have been good. Otherwise, a fun game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2003"}

Even if you are not technically inclined, this upgrade drive is very easy to install.  The transfer kit that comes with this consists of a disc and a cable and works like this:With your old drive still attached to your XBOX, use the cable to connect the new drive and put the disc in.  Follow a few simple steps and then wait for the transfer of your old data onto the new drive.  Then just unclip the old drive and snap on the new one.  That's it!  You're done!My primary reasons for wanting this drive were twofold--the new XBOX Experience dashboard that debuts Nov 18, and extra ROCK BAND tracks.  I also have some TV shows downloaded, and of course game demos and game content.  I was down to my last 3GB.  Now I have  a little over 90GB free!Lastly, a couple of notes which some might find useful: the transfer kit ONLY allows you to transfer data from a small hard drive to a larger one (not vice versa), so there is no going back to your 20GB drive once you use this.  Your original 20GB drive is erased and formatted as part of the upgrade process.  However, your original 20GB hard drive may still be used as a storage drive after you've done the transfer/upgrade.  Just like your 20GB hard drive (advertised) was only around 13GB (actual), the 120GB is more around 100GB.Conclusion: While I agree that this is a lot to pay for a 120GB hard drive by today's market, I am certainly glad that I bought this.  The included transfer kit makes the upgrade easy, and having all that free space on my XBOX gives peace of mind for future downloads.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003L51GW2","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Review: God of War - Ghost of Sparta for PSP","reviewText":"As a long time God of War fan and a follower of David Jaffe's blog, it was with high expectations that I picked up God of War: Ghost of Sparta from a local game shop. In short, Ghost of Sparta delivers just what you'd expect. A fun ride, lots of killing, naked women and huge bosses. It excels in the few spots that Chains of Olympus faltered, and successfully brings the entire God of War package to the PSP.The first scene quickly cements Kratos' drive to once again rebel against Athena's words and unleash his fury. A violent vision  recalls a day long forgotten. The day that Deimos, Kratos' brother was snatched away while Kratos looked on, unable to help. Kratos' sole drive in Ghost of Sparta is to rectify that mistake and find Deimos.From the onset you're thrust into the action, controlling a miniaturized Kratos on board a sea faring ship crawling with blade wielding baddies determined to kill you. You slash your way through the hoards using Kratos' iconic Blades of Athena, chaining familiar and new gory combos on ground and in air. New to Kratos' moveset is a running tackle, followed by a barrage of punches. If done without interruption, you can mock your victim as Kratos brutally tears him apart. It isn't long before you face Ghost of Sparta's first boss, the gigantic and menacing Scylla in the first bout of a 2 round battle. Though not as epic as the Hydra or the Colossus, the Scylla serves as a great opening battle to Ghost of Sparta.True to the original format as directed by David Jaffe, Ghost of Sparta's combat is easy to grasp and violently satisfying. Newcomers will be chaining combos and decimating colossal mythic monsters in no time. The button commands are virtually unchanged, so for vets such as myself, getting into GOS was no sweat. The Blades of Athena control as fluidly as ever, allowing you to pull off brutal kills on foe after foe as easily as in any other God of War title. You're also given the new Arms of Sparta; a shield and a large spear useful for taking out distant enemies. Fans of the hit film 300 will be glad to know that GOS pays homage, and includes the famous This is Sparta frontal Kick as one of Kratos' devastating attacks. Unfortunately no, Kratos doesn't yell out \"For Sparta!\" Perhaps next time? There is one glaring problem that wasn't present in past titles. While fighting various foes at once, sometimes they will attack from out of view. They're there but not on screen, which makes it very difficult to time blocks and dodges, especially when you're fighting Wraiths that dig under ground and lunge at you. On higher difficulties, they can prove to be one hell of a frustrating enemy. Not just frustrating, but I want to throw my PSP at a wall frustrating. That'd kill them in one shot for sure, but then i'd be down a PSP. There will be plenty of battles in GOS that will have you seeing the \"You're Dead\" screen multiple times, (the guys carrying the blue orbs will give you migraines) but that's what makes it so much fun. It's difficult and damn near impossible in some sections toward the end, but for the most part it's manageable. Ready At Dawn did an excellent job of shrinking Kratos' psychotic rage and bringing it to the PSP, but we already knew of RAD's prowess didn't we? Ready At Dawn also created 2008`s God of War: Chains of Olympus and Daxter.Ghost of Sparta also answers the age old question of what happened to the City of Atlantis. Well, Kratos got really pissed off and sank it. No seriously, GOS takes place in Atlantis as it's sinking giving the player a remarkable view of an overflowing volcano, just before it destroys the city. Shortly thereafter we visit Kratos' home, Sparta, in what is one of the series' best moments in my opinion. Instead of running through Sparta, blades in hand and killing everything that moves, Kratos slowly strolls through, at one point stopping to satisfy a few dozen women's sexual urges (Seriously, the sex mini-game in GOS tops all the others. No kidding). A brief flashback gives us a glimpse of a young Kratos and his brother, Deimos dueling just before they're forcefully separated at the hands of the then God of War, Ares. Soon after punishing a dissenter, we're given full control once more and allowed to mow down everything in Kratos' path.Once you've completed the game at least 1 time on Normal mode or above, you will have access to the true God of War fan's challenge, God Mode. God Mode is an incredibly difficult setting recommended only for advanced players. Starting a new game will also give you the option to choose from a selection of alternate attires for Kratos, each of which raise certain abilities' powers or reward you with more orbs after a kill. Treasures are back as well. This time we have Challenge Of The Gods, where you must complete 5-8 challenges that Ares and Athena task you with. They seem simple, but are anything but. In one challenge you have to open 6 chests while being attacked by several enemies. Opening a single chest with a few remaining enemies is hard enough, 6 is just sadistic. The Gauntlet, where you must kill every single enemy is bloody fun as well. The 2nd mode in Treasures is the Combat Arena. In the Combat Arena, YOU get to decide who you fight, where you fight and the level of difficulty. These modes are GOS' way of increasing replayability, but  I didn't really play them all that often. They're fun for a short while, but I'd much rather stick to the main game. The next mode is the Temple of Zeus. In this mode you can use the orbs you acquire in the main game to buy unlockables. In addition to all of that, you can also view all the in-game cinematics, a couple of videos about Deimos and a gallery.Cons:The biggest issue with Ghost of Sparta is the occasional off camera enemy who can strike at anytime without giving you any notice.Pros:New additions to the combat make it even more fun.Beautiful GraphicsGreat storyGod of War: Ghost of Sparta is a satisfying ride through the violent world of Greek Mythology, and one that no God of War fan should pass up just because it's a PSP title. Everything you love about Kratos is here, and in spades. At some points Ghost of Sparta even exceeds it's console elders. The final scene is easily one of the best, and one of the saddest in the entire franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Cool concept, but not much fun to play","reviewText":"This game seemed pretty scary in the previews, but it really isn't. It's just frustrating, and funny when it's not supposed to be. The sightjacking is kind of fun, and it works out all right. I don't think it's been done before, and it's cool to see what the enemy is seeing and hear it breathing and all that. But it's not that helpful. Even if you know where the enemy is, it's hard to know what to do to avoid them or knock them out. Some of the enemies have rifles or pistols, and they're really tough. Even if you have a gun, you need to stand to use it, and the enemy is just as good, or even better, with a gun than you are. You can't choose your own route much of the time because their is only one course of action to take if you want to live. If I was armed and the enemy didn't have a gun, I still only won half the time. The unarmed shibito can kill you in two attacks, and a guy with a gun can kill you in one shot if you're close enough. When I managed to kill the enemy, they came back to life within half a minute or so. I didn't have much time to look around, which was bad, since this is a pretty linear game, and if I missed an item, I may not progress. There is some thought involved in this game. You may need to find a key item and use it in a certain way to either move on or get a sidequest done. But often, what you think would make sense is useless and it is a seemingly random action or item that gets you to the next point. I must have died at least 30 times in the first three hours of gameplay. So basically, this is a really hard game. The question is, is it still worth playing? Well, the story is pretty interesting, although you can see some of what's coming and you can guess why everything is happening. This would make a good movie. I like the small Japanese town feel. But it is ruined by the accents. The black haired, black eyed characters apparantly grew up in Great Britain and decided to visit Japan. It's somewhat funny, but people get this game because it's supposed to be scary. The background sounds and music are pretty good, but the enemies also sound a bit ridiculous. Some of them whimper, and some randomly giggle. I laughed quite a few times, but I wasn't scared once. Sure I was worried about dying almost constantly (and with good reason, apparently), but I don't think this would give anyone nightmares. Now onto the graphics. Like I said, I really enjoyed the Japanese-looking surroundings, and it's well-done. The character details are nice, but the graphics are just okay. It's not really realistic, and it looks a lot like an old-fashioned movie. The colors are often subdued. It's not bad; it just depends on your tastes. I like Siren, but it's definitely not a game I want to spend money to own. I suggest renting it or waiting for the price to go down. I couldn't really care much about the characters, because many of them annoy me. And I didn't feel a need to see what happens next.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect.

Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it.

David Swan","summary":"Best Resident Evil ever","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 is everything the reviewers say and more. It is simply one of the greatest video games in history. It took me 28 solid hours to get through the game and I'm ready to sit down and play it again.Here is why it rocks:* The graphics are hands down the best I've ever seen on the Gamecube. The game features huge open areas, particle effects, incredible detail, awesome character motion and a smooth framerate. When I was playing the game I was struck by the thought that people could actually design such an incredibly detailed and expansive world. It was kind of the feeling I get watching a Pixar movie. It's just amazing how much work must go into these projects.* The game is gigantic almost to a ridiculous degree. I swear there must be as much real estate in this game as all the rest of the Resident Evil games combined.* No more pre-rendered backgrounds. Everything is full 3D.* No more typewriter ribbons, no more storage boxes, no more running out of ammo, tons of upgradeable weapons, more mini games. They fixed so many issues that have plagued the series since its inception.Is it perfect? No. Here is the main problem that may bother RE purists. The game is flat out not scary. There is not a moment of scare in the whole game. The closest the game comes is when Ashley is on her own with nothing more than a flashlight and some quick reflexes. Maybe it's because they got rid of the dramatic angles in the pre-rendered backgrounds, maybe it's because ammo is plentiful. More likely it's because unlike the previous games the enemies come at you relentlessly throughout. I racked up almost one thousand kills by the end of the game. The tension of being down to your last couple of bullets in a dark corner of an old mansion is gone replaced by mowing down creepy mutant hillbillies like stalks of wheat. Luckily mowing down mutant hillbillies is a blast.The game is significantly easier than previous Resident Evils. I played on Normal and beat the final boss my first time out. I NEVER managed to do that in previous versions. Also, the main villain is not the Umbrella Corporation. Umbrella is involved in the story but since Umbrella is the thread the binds the series it seemed weird to bring in a new group of villains even if they had a similar MO of genetic engineering.Regardless, RE4 is an instant classic and any imperfections are completely overshadowed by the games sheer magnificence.

This definitely works that solution. This DVD remote for the Playstation 3 works very well for the system. You can use this to play all your favorite DVD's and CD's that you've recorded as well as standard DVD's that've you've bought from your favorite music or movie shop. It is very simple to operate, and works very well. The remote works great and handles very well.

No two games in this are alike and the variety is mind boggling. The graphics are awesome and the sound is no less great. Another feature that interested me immediatly is that you can buy a house and if you kill someone in another house by you,  you can buy that one also. There is sooooo much action in this game i think it's the most action packed RPG to hit Xbox. I want to make this short and to the point so all in all Fable is the best game i've ever played it is amazing, and if you dont believe me go play it then see what you say. Last thing i want to say is that it has the coolest bosses you'll ever fight. Twinblade, Maze, King Scorpion, and best(and I mean BEST) of all Jack Of Blades. Jack is soooooooo cool I didnt even want to kill him at first cuz he's by far the coolest boss I've ever seen or heard of.

Roman","summary":"A great deal, but a lot of these don't deserve to be here.","reviewText":"I won't let nostalgia blind me, and end up being one of those 'I played these when I was little, so they're good games' people. But the funny thing is, playing the first few Sonic games, I felt like a kid again. It's been years since I really played through each one, the last time being on the Sonic collection for the Xbox, though I didn't spend much time with it. Getting to explore all the areas, trying to get the emeralds, it felt great to play good Sonic games again, and it makes you wonder why the developers screwed him up so bad after the first Dreamcast game. But here, you're getting much more than Sonic. And you know what the best thing might be? It's something overlooked by many- the ability to save at any time. This is basically a giant emulator package, and now you can save anytime you want when playing any game here. If only we were so lucky to have that feature with Ecco the Dolphin back in the early 90s...You can see the list of games here on the product page, so I won't go into detail about them- you either know the games or you don't. And truth be told, a lot of them don't deserve to be in this collection. A few are so generic that I had a hard time believing that Sega couldn't have picked any other game to fill in the blanks. Those ones are Fatal Labyrinth, Beyond Oasis, E-SWAT, Gain Ground, Super Thunder Blade, Alien Storm, Kid Chameleon, Flicky, Ristar and Alex Kidd. Some of you might be wondering why I included Ristar, because it has a cult folllowing, but the game doesn't hold up very well in this day and age, and I had a hard time playing for even 3 levels before the sound effects gave me a headache. Most of the other games here though, still hold up well, even if a lot of them are simple. The Streets of Rage and Golden Axe series were classic brawlers in their time, and while there's barely any skill involved now, it's good for a run down memory lane to see just how far action games have come since then. I was really surprised to see Decap Attack on this collection- it was one of my favorite games for the Genesis, and held up reasonably well when I played it on here. Who knew that a game about a decapitated mummy could've been made back in the days when Mortal Kombat drew more attention than the Grand Theft Auto sequels have in recent history? I had fun playing through most of the better titles on here, but I probably won't be going through them again unless someone comes over and we want to just mess around in one of them. The Sonic games are always good for a quick go, and beating either Ecco the Dolphin title is a challenge only those with high levels of patience should attempt.The game's load times are quick, and the longest loading times are those when you quit a game and when the title screen starts up. Otherwise, once you select a game, you get right into it. Saving is quick as well, and you can even set the controller to whatever works for you, though most of these games used three buttons when they came out, and I can't see any point in changing preferences for the ps3. The games are all presented in HD, but come on, there's not much point in doing that given how old they are. Still, things look as good as they possibly can, and they sound great too.Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection also has some neat bonuses to unlock as you progress through each game. There are a few extra games to unlock (the first Phantasy Star being the main one people tend to go for), video interviews with some of the game creators, and artwork. To me, the greatest bonus was hearing one of the developers talk about how much gamers are going to love the new Sonic game (at the time, Sonic the Hedgehog for ps3 and 360) because of the story and new characters. This made me laugh because those are the two things that everyone hates about the new Sonic games, and here he is, with a straight face, talking about how great they are. That's always good for a quick laugh. The other interviews are worth a watch, and you learn a lot from them about what they wanted to create, and what they hoped people playing their games would get out of them. Finally, there are lots of super easy trophies to get in the game. Actually, you could probably get most of them in one sitting since the majority only require you to complete 2 or 3 levels in a game. Others require other things, like getting a Chaos Emerald in Sonic 1, getting 100 rings as Tails in Sonic 3, or just eating 200 fish in Ecco 2. The only two that will give people problems are those in Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Columns.I'm glad I got this collection, but I can't stress enough how I doubt I'll play most of the games here ever again. Some of them, like Fatal Labyrinth and Beyond Oasis make me wonder why they were even included, and how anyone could think these games were good when they first came out. But this is a good history lesson for people who missed the Genesis, though there are a lot of great non-Sega games you should check out too that couldn't be featured here. For the current price, you could do a lot worse than this...like the DS Sonic collection that has all of 4 games and costs a few bucks more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

And also some of these games used battery backup to save the games,and we all know a battery will only last so long before it dies and all your precious data is gone,or when the carts wear out from old age!A really cool feature is you can save anywhere in the games (it saves in in a 'state' just like the SNES emulates) and there is also a smoothing option witch makes a HUGE difference in image quality.The interface is also pretty cool,it shows an old model 1 genesis as your picking your game to play,another nice touch is that when you save your games it shows the Sega genesis cart with an original art of the game cart-nice touch!there is also a whole whack of extras to watch and unlock,it will keep you very busy for a long time guaranteed!!!Edit: After playing the game for more than a week I've decided to comment a little more on the games offered,the more influential ones.The first one that comes to mind would be Phantasy Star 2 the game has won numerous awards on many gaming sites and was one of the first (if not THE first) game to have a deeper storyline and was also the first game to kill a main character,it also paved the way for many more RPGs to come after it including FF7.Another honorable mention would be Phantasy Star 4,not only was it the final chapter in the long running series (1987-1994)but it offered a new art direction (it's an example of very early anime cut-scenes,at a time when anime was still young in North America) It should be noted that this game originally retailed for $79.99 that was very expensive back in '94 and it should be noted that I have seen no game more expensive than this that wasn't a collectors edition (to put it into perspective the most expensive playstation games were never more than $59.99)The Sonic series: This is easily what helped the Genesis keep the lead it had over the SNES for so long (1991 till early 1994) but when Sega's support was waning due to the soon to be release of the doomed Saturn,the SNES got those last few punches to earn a victory in the 16Bit era with some last minute blockbuster releases,Had Sega not dropped support so early it would have won that console war,and the Sonic series would have been to thank.That's about all the games I can think of at the moment,you may have bought a Genesis for different reasons but but if you really look at it,the majority of people bought a Genesis for Sonic. I do however have a lot of older friends who originally bought a Genesis for that arcade-y experience with out wasting there entire allowance on quarters (remember: Arcades were all the rage in the late '80s to about 1997)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2009"}

After the disaster that has been the PS3 (3 years for a price cut on the worst selling current gen console?)  they have followed the PS3 division's brainstorm of removing features from the next version of hardware, but this time they are RAISING the price instead of lowering it.  On top of that, they promised to, then backed out of a trade-in or repurchase program for the millions of UMD discs people have been buying in good faith for almost 5 years now.  I have tried this console, and it is cramped, the analog nub is even more useless, and the screen size is smaller, all for $50 more than the Wii and Xbox 360 Arcade.  As Sony has eliminated themselves from almost every emerging electronics market; MP3 players, smart phones, personal communication devices, and now handheld consoles, it is clear more top brass needs to be replaced in their electronics divisions.  Please don't feed their lame ideas to force only first party software on you, the consumer.

This game is very similiar to the first civilzation. Sid Meier has made a great civilizaton game for consoles. This game is great if you want a shorter more simplier experience and also great for multiplayer. With Civilizaton IV it would take 6 or more hours to finish a decent sized game. Now with Civilization Revolution you can finish a game in under 4 hours. Also multiplayer used to take forever in Civilization IV so now that is also much shorter (about half the time) with Civilization Revolution. Keep in mind Civilzation Revolution doesnt have the depth and micro managing that Civilization IV has. Also doesnt have as much diplomacy. Its mostly about going to war and your limited to only 4 types of victories. The maps are also much smaller. Theres only nuke in the game. You cant play past 2100 AD. There are also only 16 civilizations compared to CIV IV Beyond the sword which has a total of 34. I can still see my self playing Civilization IV when I want a longer more in depth game. If I want a shorter game and maybe play multiplayer I would plya Civilization Revolution. There both good in their own ways. I am very glad they made Civilization Revolution and very happy with the end product. Very easy to use the xbox controller to navigate the units and other controls. Very well done Sid Meier and the team at Firaxis/2K games. Hopefully they will come out with more DLC and expansion packs with more Civs and maps. Easily the best console strategy game ever made. Worth every penny just like every other Civilization game ever made it has its amazing playability. Each game is completely different from each other and never gets boring.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

This is most definitely a breath of fresh air and possibly the best game of the whole series mainly because of the variety of things you can do.Some thoughts:- Lots more to do other than climbing platforms and jumping around.- A solid well thought out story that keeps you going.- Stealth, shooting, archery, melee combat...its all here for you to enjoy to some degree.- Lots of stuff to go back and collect. The save system works very well.- Lots of stuff to upgrade and skills to acquire which sort of gives an RPG element to the game.- Sounds, music, voice acting and graphics are amazing.- Gameplay...and this is important: the gameplay is fun and the quicktime events and combat do not detract from exploring or figuring out the puzzles in the game.I was very skeptic when I bought this game but after putting in double digit hours I can say its worth every penny I paid for and enjoyed every minute of the game. Great return for a classic series. I hope Crystal Dynamics continues with a sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Mario Kart 8 is \"flippin' fun!\"","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of the Mario Kart series. After all, Mario Kart DS was the game that got me into Nintendo first party gaming. As such, the Mario Kart series holds a very special place in my heart, and when Mario Kart 8 was announced back at E3 2013, I was elated - I simply couldn't wait to try out the new features. But the big question is this: Does Mario Kart 8 live up to my high expectations?*GAMEPLAY*At its surface, Mario Kart 8 is essentially a fusion of the previous two entries. Kart customization, gliding and underwater sections all return from Mario Kart 7, whereas bikes and 12-player races return from Mario Kart Wii. However, the new antigravity mechanic breathes new life into the series and brings with it an interesting new gameplay twist. While in antigravity, you are actually encouraged to hit other players, as doing so will give you a speed boost. However, you must calculate this carefully - your opponent will receive a speed boost as well. You want to hit them in such a way that it only gives you the advantage. Outside of antigravity, all of the usual Mario Kart mechanics return - the rocket boost, drifting, drafting; they're all here.Alongside the usual Grand Prix mode, the single-player VS mode makes its glorious return in Mario Kart 8. It allows you to customize a Grand Prix race to your liking, and it is personally one of my favorite modes in a Mario Kart game. Split-screen multiplayer is as fun as ever, and it never fails to be full of potential to ruin friendships. As for battle mode, the new changes don't really bother me. It can be fun in its own right, but battle mode is, more or less, a fun distraction from the core racing experience that I will only occasionally visit.And lastly, the difficulty. This game is surprisingly challenging, especially in 150cc. This is because Nintendo finally made the game faster - 150cc in Mario Kart Wii and 7 felt way too slow, and they, thankfully, fixed that here. They finally made 150cc a challenging experience that forces you to use pure skill to secure a first place win.*COURSE DESIGN*The new courses in this game are simply beautiful. Antigravity has allowed the developers to become extremely creative with the course designs, and it paid off. Perhaps one of the best examples of creative antigravity use is the course Electrodrome. The entire course takes place in the confines of a dance club, and the track just wraps around itself in this small space. It's amazing to watch as the background twists as you race along the antigravity sections. Each of the new courses provide a unique design, and I like every single one of them. Even the new Rainbow Road, which I initially was not impressed with, is fun to race on. However, it still lacks that feeling of an epic finish that Rainbow Road is supposed to have. As for the retro courses, I feel that they fall into two categories: those that embraced the antigravity concept (such as N64 Rainbow Road, 3DS Piranha Plant Slide, and N64 Toad's Turnpike) and those that received a brilliant graphical upgrade and not much else (such as Wii Moo Moo Meadows and DS Tick-Tock Clock). I do love the retro courses, but there are some that I feel could've embraced the antigravity mechanic but, sadly, didn't. The two courses that primarily stand out in this situation are 3DS Music Park and N64 Yoshi Valley. Nonetheless, the retro selection is probably the best its ever been. Overall, the courses are bursting with creativity and are filled to the brim with detail, and I honestly couldn't be happier.*CHARACTERS & ITEMS*The character roster has all of your usual Mario Kart characters, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, and more. Newcomers to the series include the seven Koopalings, Baby Rosalina, and Pink Gold Peach. Mario Kart 8 may boast the largest character selection, but it is sadly very underwhelming. The Koopalings and overload of baby characters simply take up too many character slots that could've been filled with more worthwhile characters, such as Nabbit and Professor E. Gadd.As for the item selection, the new items are insanely fun to use. The Boomerang Flower is perhaps my favorite new addition, as it allows you to throw a boomerang up to three times. The boomerang can even attack other racers on the return trip, which is really nice. The Blue Shell-stopping Super Horn is a blast to use too, as it acts as a great defensive and offensive item. The Piranha Plant is a helpful item too, as every time it chomps out at another racer or item, it gives you a speed boost. The Crazy Eight, which gives you a selection of eight items, while being extremely rare, can be helpful when you get it. The item balance in the game is the best its ever been, as Blue Shells and Lightning Bolts are much rarer than they have been in the past. The only thing I'm not happy with is that the coin is now an item, and it is practically the only item you will get in first place. If you happen to get a banana or a shell in first place, hold on to it for dear life - chances are the next item you get will be a coin.*ONLINE MODES*Online play, like most other things in this game, is the best its ever been. It's pure chaos and fun - and I love it that way. I do like that the game only gives you three courses to chose from when voting for the next race. This greatly prevents playing the same race over and over again, a problem that constantly plagued Mario Kart 7. The game does allow you to send pre-written messages to the other racers while voting for a course and you are allowed to voice chat in friends-only mode. The new tournament mode replaces communities from Mario Kart 7, but it essentially acts in the same way and it provides the same amount of fun. The game thankfully doesn't suffer from lag during online play and it manages to keep a consistent frame rate.Mario Kart TV is an amazing new addition that allows you to edit your highlight reels to focus on certain parts of the race - examples include big item hits, action shots, and drifting shots. You can also upload your edited highlight reel to YouTube and Miiverse, which is an awesome feature, but sadly has a major drawback. It takes forever to upload one highlight reel to YouTube. At times, it can take upward of 10 minutes to upload a 60-second clip. In addition, you cannot have the clip upload in the background and keep playing at the same time. You are forced to wait until the clip is fully uploaded before you are allowed to return to playing. This is rather ridiculous, and I'm hoping Nintendo will fix this with a game patch in the future. Despite this drawback, Mario Kart TV is a great feature and can be really fun to mess around with.*GAMEPAD INTEGRATION*The GamePad is used in several ways. By default, it displays a goofy horn that really serves no purpose. The GamePad can also display an overhead map of the course which also shows you the location of the other racers. In both of these modes, the position of every racer and the items they have is displayed on the left side of the screen. You can also use the GamePad for Off-TV Play. In addition, you can use the GamePad for motion control steering, and it works just as well as using a Wii Wheel. However, I feel that Nintendo could've used the GamePad in more creative ways as well. For example, I do like that the rear-view mirror returned from Mario Kart Wii, but I think it would've been better if Nintendo had built that in as a GamePad feature. It would be much easier to have the GamePad screen display the rear-view mirror rather than you having to take your thumb off the gas and press a different button to activate the rear-view mirror. In addition, you cannot have someone play solely on the GamePad in offline multiplayer. It's sad that Nintendo couldn't work five-player split-screen into this game and is ultimately a missed opportunity.*GRAPHICS & SOUND*There's no denying it; Mario Kart 8 is simply gorgeous. The concept of taking Mario's cartoony art style and mixing it with realism really pays off. The game is bursting with colors, details, and realistic lighting effects. To top it all off, the game runs in a silky-smooth 60fps. The game is able to maintain that frame rate in all modes except three- and four-player split-screen, where it is halved to 30fps. Nonetheless, Mario Kart 8 truly is the first example that really shows what the Wii U is capable of doing, so long as the hardware is used properly.To top it all off, the game has a phenomenal soundtrack. This marks the first time that Nintendo has used live music in a Mario Kart game, and, like the new art style, it pays off. The orchestrated music breathes new life into the courses, as the environment is constantly seen moving and bopping along to the music. The remixes for the retro courses are simply beautiful and they never fail to provide a brief burst of nostalgia. Mario Kart 8 boasts the best soundtrack in the series, and I am ever thankful that Nintendo is beginning to embrace using live music in their games.*VERDICT*Despite its minor shortcomings, Mario Kart 8 is simply marvelous. The racing formula found here is at its absolute finest, and the new courses truly provide one of the best Mario Kart experiences out there, and it's all topped off by the game's beautiful graphics and orchestrated music. In the end, Mario Kart 8 didn't just live up to my expectations; it exceeded them, and I can safely say that Mario Kart 8 is the best game in the series and is a must-have for any Wii U owner.GAMEPLAY: 10/10COURSE DESIGN: 10/10CHARACTERS & ITEMS: 8/10ONLINE MODES: 9/10GAMEPAD INTEGRATION: 7/10GRAPHICS & SOUND: 10/10FINAL SCORE (not an average): 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

The cinematics are great, and it game play isn't too hard to start out with.  Most games I own have the cheat codes nearby, but this one is challenging without being impossible, so there's no need for that yet.  The game's not perfect though.  There are a few areas that are a little hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing (during one training session, you're told to free fall and how to speed it up or slow it down, but you're never told what you're falling after...it's a training dummy that's falling faster than you, by the way).  Plus, sometimes Batman breaks into a run when you just want to change positions on him, which causes a few problems when navigating narrow ledges.  I love the fact that with a push of a button you can immediately have the camera back behind you so it's easy to see things if the camera angle gets freaky (a little attribute that the new Spider Man game DESPERATELY needed).  It's a lot of fun, and entertaining enough to keep the kids (and their parents like me) having fun for a long time.  You definitely want to add this one to your collection (at least until the next Tomb Raider comes along - or the sequel to this game!).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2002"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"An excellent balance of puzzles, action, and style","reviewText":"Batman: Vengeance looks just like the cartoon, including the voice actors and designs. This game takes place after the cancellation of the Batman cartoon series. That's the latest incarnation -- not the original series, but the slimmer, darker version of Batman that incorporated designs from the movie. For those of you who didn't follow along, Batman lost Robin and only had Batgirl as a sidekick.Batman: Vengeance, starts out right. You are immediately thrust into play as Batman slides down a slippery slope with an explosion behind him. The player doesn't have a whole lot to do -- for the most part, Batman's going to make it regarless if Batsy slides to the left or right -- but it got me excited about the game.Batman's got a compelling plot, including Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze, led by the Joker (voiced by &quot;I used to be Luke Skywalker&quot; Mark Hamil). The Joker maneuvers Batman into release the right combination of chemicals in an effort to stop other villains. By manipulating Batman into these situations, he inadvertently mixes a dangerous concoction that threatens Gotham.Things look a bit different because the characters are rendered in three dimensions, which is different from Superman: Shadow of Apocalips. So the characters look similar, but they're not quite right.Batman has a multitude of tools at his disposal, including the Batmobile and the Batjet. Batman vaults around the city with his batgrapple, throws batarangs, and uses his cloak as a defense as well as a means of gliding from place to place. Which is important, because Batman fights on a lot of rooftops and ledges -- death from falling happened a lot.The game takes itself seriously. Joker, Harley, and their cronies play for keeps. They shoot machineguns, try to push you off ledges, and otherwise kill you. True to the cartoon, the bad guys fight dirty and it's up to Batman to use his formidable abilities to overcome his disadvantage -- ya know, not having a gun.Batman is well-rendered, but there were some graphic flaws. There is a &quot;snap to&quot; function that allows you to recenter the camera, facing the way Batman's facing. This is less of a good use of the camera as it is a lazy fix to a problem that is problematic for too many games. Unfortunately, it snaps so quickly that sometimes I became disoriented by the new angle. Additionally, the camera is an object and will bounce off walls, forcing itself literally inside Bat's head. Which looks weird and doesn't help the perspective if Batman is against a wall.Batman also has some clipping bugs. In at least two different cases, Batman froze in space after getting trapped on the corner of a three-dimensional object. Then he couldn't leave it and I had to start over. Batman: Vengeance only saves when you IT wants you to. You have to finish the board to get to that point, which makes for an either frustrating or easy experience, depending on your level of skill.By far the best part of the game is fighting my favorite villain, Mr. Freeze. Sure enough, Freeze cannot be fought in hand-to-hand combat (if you've ever seen Batman try, you'll understand) and it requires some crafty maneuvering. There are a multitude of mini-games that test your skill and your brains. Although none are particularly hard, they help break up the gameplay. There are puzzle games, the aforementioned Batmobile and Batjet games, and some other puzzles.This is good, because barring the unique villains (including Mr. Freeze's Eskimo chickies, Poison Ivy's root-men, and the Joker's mimes), there isn't too many bad guy types. The villains do, in typical movie fashion, stop shooting once Batman engages one of their comrades in melee, politely waiting until he goes down to resume firing. They also react to their surroundings, listening to noises, reacting to their allies socking one to Bats (they cheer), and falling off ledges. Yes, you can actually knock someone off a building and watch them plunge to their death. Now THAT'S Batman!Overall, Batman: Vengeance is an excellent balance of puzzles, action, and style. It was a great opportunity to return to the cartoon I enjoyed so much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"Still My Favorite Game","reviewText":"I bought this game over 1 year ago and have decided to finally write a review (which I never did after the initial purchase). I have played many games in recent years on the Xbox and Xbox360 format and I have always come back for a round of fun with GTA4. Having played through the entire campaign mode and done a fair amount of multiplayer I felt it was timeto go back and add my thoughts on one of Rockstar's most beloved (and controversial at times) GTA series.This game has incredibible content and there are so many side quests and activities you really can't get bored. In fact it is the only game I own that I can honestly say that will draw me into sheer mayhem. By that I mean I will put in my game console and not even think about story missions or mutliplayer ....... just put it in and head to a weapon shop, and buy unlimited weapons and fly around the city in helicopter, landing on rooftops .... and surviving 4, 5 or even 6 star onslaughts from the cops.  I will add that I competed GTA to 100% and got the \"Key To The City\" achievement to unlock the unlimited weapon ability ...... but its worth it if you want to load up a game just to cause an hour or 2 of mayhem. It's crazy and insane yes, but I love it !!I agree with a recent reviewer about the friends, yes they were a pain at times but the special abilities they unlock can benefit you greatly while doing the story mode. In fact the \"Liberty City Five\" is one of the achievments I unlocked that I am most proud of ...... when you get the character Packie on board and his \"like \" rises his bomb planting ability is a hoot. Its done by cell phone and I laugh every time I have used it !! I would encourage anyone to take him to an activity, he's very foul mouthed and his comments were among the best, especially when it came to drinking with Niko ..... try this and listen to his rants, it can be hilarious !!Online is pretty fun but admittedly this game seems to draw some of the rudest players I think (maybe the criminal element breeds that style of play online too !!). Its a great game, and I pre-ordered GTA5 because of my love of GTA4 ..... not San Andreas, which I have also played. GTA4 is a bit hard edged compared to other previous entries, but its a good buy. I hope GTA5 mixes a little more \"over the top fun\" like San Andreas, but in case they don't .... \"Niko Style\"  GTA works too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}

The thing about Pokemon that appeals to people is the fact that it is so addicting to play, you basically catch Pokemon, train em and battle with them. Just leveling up your Pokemon is fun alone, about half my time playin Platinum is mainly just training and leveling up my pokemon. The story (as all pokemon games) is about YOU the trainer about becoming the best trainer in the region, its a tiresome formula in the Pokemon universe but it won't really matter as much. There are about 210 pokemon in the main game and 493 pokemon in the entire universe that you can get by hacking or trading w/ other people. I personally like the game, nothing major has changed that differs from the previous pokemon games but it seems to work cuz its still gonna sell millions if not otherwise.Gameplay - if you've played previous pokemon games den you should feel rite at home. You still can only carry 6 pokemon, they still can only have 4 moves and you can level them up to 100 at max. The battles themselves are more interesting in this game, the new animations for the attacks are nice to see. Same pokemon formula so its a good and bad thing. 4/5Graphics - now in pokemon games, graphics are the least important things to worry about, but since it is on the DS you should expect amazing graphics. This is simply not the case, its a 2D RPG but they have added sum 3D elements to make it less repetitive with the scenaries. Not bad tho. 4/5Sound - no voice actors, but the music in the game is amazing. The music ranges from lighthearted sounds when you stroll down town to epic sounds when you are about to enter the battle. The music in Pokemon is THE most important thing in this game. I personally love the music and sounds in the game. 5/5Fun Factor - even though the formula hasn't changed, its still the fun addicting game thats reputation still remains ever since its launch back in 1998. Pokemon Platinum is a fun game that beats the rest of the other pokemon games, and since it is a remake of Diamond and Pearl it remains the best Pokemon game ever made. Still Fun, Still Addicting. 4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2009"}

The campaign feels long and drawn out artificially due to very difficult AI; even on the easy setting, it's likely you will be forced to play long segments of the game multiple times as a result of poorly-placed checkpoints. Also, on the visual front, the use of lighting seems odd at times. On some levels, it feels like someone is shining a flashlight directly into your face no matter where you go, which is distracting and adds no value.Overall, I had higher expectations for this game and hope for better titles to come out soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}

I didn't care for the original, it had it's features, it simply wasn't a well put together product. The second one brought a little more polish, and had a lot of very interesting and fun aspects, however, it's story and direction was uninspiring, or, in my case, unfollowable (I eventually got lost, and so did my interest in playing any further). Finally came Farcry 3, and I waited weeks, if not months, to give this game a go - I was not disappointed!The story is pretty well done! Similar to modern action games like Uncharted 2, there is a lot of little things, action sequences, that keep your interest.The graphics a great! They kept the ability to cause forest/plains fires, though I had wished they spent more time on this - the fires don't get as raging or dangerous as they were in Farcry 2 - just a minor annoyance.There are plenty of side quests and collecting, and it's well implemented in that you can locate on the map the general area where something is located.The weapons are well done - all feel pretty different, and unique. Though the bow is the show stopper! Best bow implementation I've ever seen!There is a crafting system, which I wish they had spent just a little more time with. As it is, the effects of your potions/medicine are too minor, for the annoyance of gathering supplies to produce the goods. Others might have more luck/fun with this, in the end, there were only about three potions/medicines I wanted to make - the final ones.The game feels a good length. At one part I had thought the game might be nearing the end, when in fact, it was only about 70% complete.Check points are very well done! You don't really have to repeat too much running around, they check point you right outside your mission area.There are tons of different ways to dispatch a set of enemies, often you'd even have more fun redoing an area than the first time.My biggest complain would be that I would have liked to see a little more time spent on the leveling perks, the crafting, and the car driving kind of sucks. However, it's hard not to have high expectations for the next release. Hopefully they remain true to this new engine/system, and we see more goodness come from these developers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place.

The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move.

This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times).

Enjoy a total of seven Mega Man games with remixed soundtracks original and sketch art, plus many other cool features!","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"Fantastic games with one hidden gotcha","reviewText":"Growing up in the 90s the Megaman X series was pretty defining for me. Overnight I went from playing classic megaman - a great franchise in its own right - to the 16-bit incarnation, visually lush games with over-the-top explosions, crazy weapons, and all the effects and colors and depth you'd expect from the SNES (and later PS1) generation of this series.If you've not had the pleasure, Megaman X tells the story of Dr. Light's SECOND boy wonder robot. X is a reploid, an android with the power to make ethical decisions (this is a cloudy distinction since the Classic Megaman robots all had free will too, but the implication seems to be that the original Megaman had a predefined understanding of right and wrong and merely got to choose how he went about the right thing). X is buried in Dr. Light's lab for testing and recovered decades later. X becomes the prototype of a new generation of robots, but some begin to go maverick, becoming insane and hostile toward humans. This is exacerbated when Sigma, a military robot built to lead reploids against mavericks goes maverick himself. Once again, Megaman must Fight! For everlasting peace! This time he has some help though, in the form of Zero, Dr. Wily's attempt at a true thinking machine. Zero, and his beautiful rock hair, are playable from X3 onward.This collection includes Megaman X 1-6, omitting the PS2 installments, which are crap anyway. All are solid games with great visuals for their eras and thumping soundtracks (the music walks an odd line between GNR 80s metal and classic NES chiptunes and is solidly great in all the games). Of course it's a Capcom game so the controls are tight beyond reproach, and purists will note the emulation of the older games here is actually a little SMOOTHER than how they originally played- for instance moments of lag when Zero's theme loads in X1 are totally absent here. Rockman Battle and Chase is an unlockable extra, but it's not very good and not why you'd buy this collection.So this is a pretty great package and worth your money. But it does have one caveat: this game uses the same sub-SD video mode the original SNES games did. As such, if you are outputting to an HDTV or high-def capable receiver over component, there's a good chance your video will glitch to unplayability. This is a product of HD tuners not quite \"getting\" low def over component, and there are a couple fixes:-Play the game on a first-gen PS3, which will cost you about $600 if you don't already have it-Play the game over S-video or composite cable, which will make your picture duller and blurrier-Get an upscaler VGA line-box for your PS2 which will certainly cost more than the game itself-Connect your PS2 to a reciever that supports component OUT, WITH SCALING, so that your receiver can upscale the cruddy component resolution and your TV can make sense of it, which is a huge hassle and expenseCapcom easily could have scaled the game up- as they did with the Megaman Anniversary Collection. But they didn't, and for that reason I'm giving some of my favorite games of all time only 3 stars. That said, this is still the best (legit) way to play all the 2D X games, and for me it was worth stepping down to S-video. You be the judge!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Dan Leithauser","summary":"Linear SF themed FPS","reviewText":"The price is right, just showing that if you wait long enough, you will get a deal on a fun, up to date game.  Steam sometimes has a deal, so look around for the best price.  Never having played the first Fear series, I cannot make any comparisons to prior versions.  I can tell you that the most current version is a first class FPS with plenty of ammo and a variety of weaponry to entertain those into this type of game.  While there are cookie cutter similarities in all of these games, dating back to the original Doom engine and model --notably how you find armor, ammo, and things to shoot at-- Fear adds a nice touch of hallucinations along with a solid linear story line.  The ending is satisfying, although it took me a couple of times to understand what I was seeing.Graphics are top notch, on par with Left 4 Dead, but not as detailed as Fallout 3.  Hallucinatory sequences are very satisfying graphically, pulling you in and leading up to something you will need to pay attention to.  No stuttering or other glitches occurred with Vista 64 and a Nvidia 9800m GS video card at the highest video settings available.  The AI, while linear and mostly predictable, presented a challenging game, especially in a couple of sequences.  The ability to slow down time was unnecessary for much of the game but came in handy near the end.  The add-on DLC \"Reborn\" required many more slow downs in battle and seemed a bit more challenging in spots.Overall linearity is broken up with a couple of sequences of falling through windows and multiple levels, along with a variety of hallways, buildings, control rooms, and outside areas.  It is difficult to get lost, but it holds interest on the first go around. Second time?If you like FPS linear shooters, I assure you that Fear 2: Project Origin and the add-on DLC reborn, will give you a number of hours of fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

I really like the art direction they took in this game as opposed to the prior 2--it's grittier and more story-driven which draws you in to keep on playing.  The huge assortment of guns is back and they are all fun to play with and level up.  The controls are very good, the graphics are okay, but again the art direction makes up for average graphics.  The pacing of the game is also good, but the difficulty spikes in certain areas because the health packs are not consistently strewn about.  You'll find huge stockpiles in some locations, and not enough in other areas when you need them, and they cannot be stored.  Others have mentioned some bugs and yes, unfortunately this is not a well polished game.  I've seen enemies that stay frozen as a statue while you're firing at them and an enemy boss that I just couldn't kill after unloading all my ammo into it. But overall, the game's difficulty is about right on normal that you won't be tearing your hair out.  Just remember, this isn't Call of Duty and your health doesn't regenerate.  The best part of the game is the assortment of weapons which enables you to decide how your enemies will meet their fate.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

More than a normal sandbox game, Red Dead Redemption uses a lot of specific features and stylistic choices from the GTA series. In this way, it shares many of the series' shortcomings, but also improves on the openness and freedom of the sandbox concept.\"Red Dead Redemption\" takes place in the early 1900s, in the last days of the Wild West. The player character is John Marston, a former outlaw now being coerced into hunting his former gang-mates. The game tries to convey a sense of rural desolation - there's a lot of empty space between towns populated by wild animals and the occasional rider or messenger. The environment is sort of a mish-mash of Western stereotypes, including Southwestern deserts, boomtowns, old mines, and jaunts over the border to Mexico.Like most GTA games, \"Red Dead Redemption\" can best be described as an open-world environment with a linear set of missions. In short, you can tool around all you want in the open world segments, but eventually you're going to have to do the missions to move the story along and access new areas. However, unlike GTA (where all you could really do in the open world was mess around), the open world of RDR is a lot more developed and natural. For example, while GTA was a busy city with very few actual events, RDR focuses a lot more on random roadside events - horse thieves, stagecoach robberies, and bandit ambushes. How you participate in these events (by helping the innocent, helping the robbers, or ignoring it entirely) affects your honor rating, the game's version of a standard morality meter.The game has a lot to do besides fighting criminals (or being one). Towns and settlements will inevitably have some games of chance like Poker, Blackjack, or Horseshoes, and you can while away the hours making or losing money. Out in the wilderness, you can hunt and skin animals, then sell their meat and pelts in town for extra cash. Still, the game feels largely objective-oriented. You can buy houses, but only to save in or change outfits in. You can become famous and well-known, but only by doing missions or random events. It feels largely like a world that you can only interact with in the context of furthering your main story goals.The gameplay itself is good. Gunplay is fast and lethal; the player character has regenerating health, but not that much health in total. This means that if you survive an initial few shots and get to cover, you'll probably be okay, but you can't run through hails of bullets or anything. In combat terms, the game's main \"equalizer\" is the Dead-Eye mode. This is a mode that slows down time and, later, allows you to target your shots for a consecutive burst of gunfire. It's neat in theory, but eventually becomes a crutch. You get so much \"juice\" for Dead-Eye mode that it's easier to start and finish every fight in a single use of it than to actually try and fight all the enemies before you. The guns are interesting, but hardly unique. It's the usual layout of pistols, rifles, shotguns, and so on, except that it's Wild West technology instead of modern technology.The game has a multiplayer mode that seems interesting on paper, but isn't that great in actual practice. Essentially, it's a scaled-down MMO version of the main game. Players have access to the whole map, and can join up in posses with other players to hunt outlaws or rob stagecoaches. However, the lack of real interaction rears its ugly head again, because there's only so much you can actually do in the world. The more conventional deathmatch modes are sort of fun, but hardly groundbreaking.Overall, Red Dead Redemption is a reasonably fun game. Still, the forced mission segments were more annoying than fun (especially in plot terms - \"hey, these guys are clearly evil, maybe we should stop working with them before they betray us\"). The sandbox makes up for it in a lot of ways, but even that is too limited to be great. However, as Wild West games go, you could do a lot worse.Rating: 7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2010"}

I'm just rating for the sake of just that. After doing much research here on Amazon, then playing Skyrim for myself I have to say that All the 5 Star Reviews Are Right when saying this game has lived up to the hype and is the greatest RPG on xBox360. Skyrim stretched the consoles capabilities to the limits with it's vast open world, stupendous graphics, and arsenal of unending quest/things to do. This game is worth the $ for sure and a *five***Stars* in my book.There's a lot of complaints I noticed on Amazon about the gamebreaks, freezing, bugs, etc..... I only ran into one Freeze and I'm 70 hours in and completed the main story. This is my advice since this is something I practiced in Morrowind that may help prevent these little hickups. Biggest thing is don't litter too much when playing Skyrim. When you don't need an item sell it to a merchant, try not to throw it on the ground because the game then has to remember that the item was left there. This causes the game to work slightly harder and can cause more loading+potential freezing/glitches. Just something that has worked for me idk it may work for anyone else. Also I only use 4 save files when playing Skyrim. 1 is master save file where I physically have to click save (it's been rewritten 450 times, yeah I save a lot.) The other 3 are auto saves that the game does consistently. Again this is another technique I practice when playing a vast game as this because it makes less that has to be remembered.Here's a funny incident when I did litter in a town. One of the guards saw me do it then approached me saying \"Hey you can't leave that there go pick it up\". Might be Bethesda hinting on the topic : DAny who it's a great game and you can get it for cheap in the used section.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"A Flawed Superb Game","reviewText":"This game is a revolutionary hybrid of a third-person shooter and role-playing game with an amazing original sci-fi world and story. However, at its best the game is very flawed, but that can easily be overlooked. Even when I played the game now, years after its release I had a lot of fun in a very immersive game (though the graphics are a bit dated). The mako is very annoying, but I actually had fun with it at times when traversing mountains at impossible angles, it could have been improved in the next game instead of eliminated. For the shooting gameplay, the cover system is pretty much broken. However I loved all of the additions/adaptations you could make to your weapons, they actively changed the way you played for the better, especially at higher levels. Also, there were a lot of cool powers and abilities, and a great level and power up tree. It was a little strange how almost all of your characters are gained right at the beginning in the citadel (with those horrible elevators) with only one character being added after. In the end, the story is where this game is made, there really has never been anything like it. You can make any choice you wish, so much more, sometimes I even did crazy things just to see if they'd let me, like killing the Krogan character over nothing. Bioware built the foundation for something amazing with this game, and everyone should try this out at one time or another.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Scariest part is that other people liked it.","reviewText":"I never saw a horror-survival game before, and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me.  So, I rented Silent Hill 2.  I figured I would be scared out of my mind, battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere, hearing strange spooky sounds, basically playing the game on the edge of my seat.  How wrong I was.First off, this is a sorry attempt at a game.  People say this is a puzzle game.  In it's loosest definition - yes it is.  The same way old games like King's Quest were puzzle games.  Basically, all you do is walk.  That's it.  You walk.  Really nothing else.  You walk and hope you find something.  Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else.  That's it.  There's no complex or intriguing puzzle, it's just search around until you grab something.That was cool, in the 1980s, when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters.  This is the 2000s, and there is no excuse for it now.So, all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster.  That wouldn't be so bad - if they didn't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world!  To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever.  The controls are sticky and clumsy, and the guy is really, really slow.  Since there's fog or darkness, you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction.How about the environment?  Not once was I scared or awed.  The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game.  The fog is cool for a second, but annoys you afterwards.  The monsters are a joke.  They're little bodies that couldn't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine.Also, the \"puzzles\" are just plain ridiculous.  For example, here's what you have to do when you enter the town.  You're just in the town with no explicit instructions.  So you wander, then wander some more, then you finally find a key.  Big whoop, a key.  Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to.  So, after playing for an hour, you've opened a gate.  In Grand Theft Auto 3, you would have already killed a few people, and completed some fun missions.  In ICO, you would have explored a large castle, rescued a girl, and escaped dreadful spirits.  This game - you only opened a damn gate.  Once you're in the apartment building, you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same.  Finally, after another hour, what do you get?  A cool new weapon?  A great story cut-scene?  No - you get a flashlight.  What does the flash light do?  Reveal new secrets?  Find new terrifying monsters?  No - you can now read the map of the apartment building.  Two and a half of hours of game play, and I've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map.  Bored already?What's worse is when you need to something to continue the story, but they won't tell you what.  This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didn't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building.  Remember, moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself.  After being stuck for a few hours because I didn't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin, I knew this game had no hope.  I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same.  I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [the store].Finally, in order to save, you actually have to actively search out the save game places.  This was the final straw.I kind of wanted to see the ending, but then I figured what it was.  Here's a spoiler for you.  The monsters that roam the town?  They're not trying to kill you.  Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death, warning you to return this game immediatately!You want a good puzzle game?  Get ICO instead.  This game just plain [smells].  It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2002"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the most frightening video games ever made","reviewText":"In terms of survival horror games, Resident Evil 4 had easily worn the crown in terms of scaring the crap out of you.  Key word there was had. Dead Space is by and far one of the most frightening video games you will ever play, taking the idea of \"monsters on a space ship\" and upping the ante in nearly every department.  You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer dispatched to the ship Ishimura after contact has been lost.  It doesn't take long to learn that the crew of the Ishimura have been mutated into horrible creatures, and it's up to you to wreak bloody havoc upon them and learn what happened.  First and foremost, Dead Space features some of the most horiffic creature designs you'll catch in a video game.  These Necromorphs aren't all that easy to take down either, leading up to some just plain awesome boss battles to boot.  What Dead Space manages to accomplish in terms of innovation is also very much worth noting, as the traditional elements like a health meter are featured right on your character via a meter going down his spine, and telling how much ammo you have left can be seen when you raise your weapon into position.  Elements like these make Dead Space an all the more immersive gaming experience, and the game's enthralling story only adds to it.  Technically speaking, Dead Space is a marvel in terms of graphics and sound design, offering so many moments of brilliance amidst the horror.  The game is blood-curdlingly violent, and being able to improvise using your surroundings during battle adds to this as well.  The ship itself is wonderfully designed and gives off a feeling of claustrophobic dread; all of which helps add up to make Dead Space a brilliant and immersive survival horror experience.  If there's any flaws to be found, it's that the mission objectives can get repetitive, but other than that, Dead Space is nearly flawless.  All in all, you are unlikely to play any better, or scarier, survival horror games now or in the near future, and even if survival horror isn't really your thing, you should definitely check out Dead Space regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2008"}

The depth is incredible. While on foot, you play as one of five specialized classes (assault, medic, scout, antitank, or engineer) with varying equipment and abilities. The choice of vehicles ranges from a selection of tanks, jeeps, and other fairly standard mechanized land vehicles to exotic craft like battleships, submarines, and dive bombers. Best of all, you can pit yourself against your fellow man in objective-based online battles in four distinct WWII theaters of war: North Africa, South Asia Pacific, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe. This is everything thatWorld War II Onlineshould have been. This isTribes 2with better code, graphics, control--everything, and without the cheesy sci-fi trappings. This out-WWIIsMedal of HonorandReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. This game is like the ultimate sandbox, with all the best toys.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Awesome Game with some flaws","reviewText":"Of all the WWII simulation games out there, Battlefield 1942 is by far the most fun.  In the vein of Unreal Tournament, BF1942 is a multiplayer on-line game in which teams of players compete in games such as capture the flag, 'control' type games that require you to hold positions from the enemy, and other such games.The graphics are excellent and the thrill of battle is always there.  Playing online is fun, if you can get past some rather idiotic players spewing unintelligable jibberish all over the screen, and players tend to work together to achieve the game goals.There are a few flaws in the game, mostly from the single player perspective.  The AI of your computer controlled teammates is, for lack of a better word, retarded.  Since the single player game consists of 'Control' missions, you must hold off yor key points from enemy take-over.  Unfortunately, your computer teammates do nothing but work against you.  More often than not, they kill each other with friendly fire.  They are never capable of holding their positions, especially in later levels, requiring you to do all the work for the map.  Maps that have 5 or more control points are extremely difficult to handle, especially on your own.  Since computer AI is so dumb, you end up having to fight off legions of enemy forces by yourself, most of the time unsuccessfully.Other problems include AI control of vehicles.  While it is easier to let the computer teammate take control of a difficult to manuever vehicle such as a plane, often times their flight patterns are bizarre.  They will sometimes go off the map(where you will beging to take automatic friendly fire), or just circle one area of the map, not doing anything, while all the action takes place somewhere else.  Other examples include manning tanks, with the AI teammate just sitting in one position, not doing anything, while you're stuck on top manning the machine gun.  Little problems like that get very annoying, and drag the quality of the game down an entire star.But otherwise, this game is alot of fun.  The thrill of fighting in World War II is all there and it is a great simulation.  This is probably one of the better computer games available right now.  Unfortunately the aforementioned flaws will try your patience and you will have to learn how to be a one-man army while the enemy uses your computer teammates for target practice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2003"}

I've also seen a 160 GB offered for the same price as this bundle.You get everything in the Assassin's Creed 3 bundle that you need to play right out of the box, PLUS a 1 month Playstation Plus membership (which, in this owner's opinion, if you're a gamer at all, is a must-purchase for a year ($50).  Just since March, I've gotten TEN retail games for free, $600 would have been the retail cost, even at $20 a piece that's $120.  That's not to mention the various discounts and FULL game trials you receive as well, along with early access to demo's, and much more.One note about this PS3 vs. the other models.  The \"tray\" to insert your game/DVD is now on the top.  No more sticking it in and ejecting it.  If you've got nosy/playful children, they might get a little *too* playful and wreck this newer system.  So take that into consideration when deciding whether to go with the 2nd model or this one.Of course, this system also comes with Assassin's Creed III, which is a triumph in gaming.  To be able to go back to an \"alternative universe\" with the American Revolution, but keeping the heart of AC beating, for 20-40 hours of gameplay (at least) along with post-DLC support is well worth the investment.  And, if you're not an AC fan, just list it for $40 brand new and people will beat down your door to buy it!Bottom line:  If you've had your PS3 for a long time, or have one of the older models (ESPECIALLY the fat one, unless you have it to be able to play PS2 games ;), don't even hesitate.  Unless this bundle is priced at $199 on Black Friday, there isn't a better PS3 deal around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

Microsoft offers this for free as of Jan 1, 2014 until Jan 15.This game is not for everyone.  If you are into deep story lines or more variation game play, you would not enjoy the entire game.I personally like it very much because of its variation from my other games. I've never played GTA or any of those role-playing games, so I can't compare it with those games.Story LineYou play as an undercover copy in the triad in Hong Kong.  I find the story line engaging without overkill.  Following the story is easy enough and the side quests are not overwhelming.  If you decide to just stick with the story line, I would imagine finishing the game relatively quickly.  If you want to do some side quest, you can have fun with it.GameplayThe controls are easy enough.  The fighting is quite repetitive and challenging at first.  Without knowing some of the combos, fighting thugs can be quite frustrating.  Sometimes the gange of thugs will go at you 2 or 3 at a time.  Once I know the combos, beating the thugs is relatively easy.  You have most of Hong Kong to play with.  While not all buildings can be played, I find that I have freedom to go where I want to go.  The game is non-linear.  I wished there is more way to engage the public than to just accidently bumped them.GraphicThe graphic is actually quite good consider that this is done in a 360.  Some of the people are well rendered.  This is a plus because instead of talking to robots, you feel more engaged (note: love Tiffany :)VehiclesOne of the best things to play with in the game is the available vehicles.  While the controls are easy and fun enough, there is lack of reality to it.  For example, there is no way to know how fast I'm driving.  Hitting anything would not have any negative impact.  I've killed several innocent bystanders and it has no impact on my standing.VoiceoverI'm Cantonese and I'm surprised of the authenticity of the voiceovers.  The actors doing the voiceovers are really good.  I coud tell that actors from Hong Kong are used.  This is a plus.This is a well built game.  I'm surprised how fast it drops in value consider that this game is only a year old.  It is fun for adults who want to play something different.  This game is not recommened for kids due to its foul language and blood and gore.  If I knew this game is that much fun, I would be willing to pay for it months ago.

GTA IV was a very lifeless world with nothing to do most of the time except take really long drives across the whole city to get from mission to mission.  The story was interesting and kept me playing but I was not going back after it was done.  Saints Row: The Third is just out of control.  The story is over the top and the action is intense.  The world is full of things to do but it left me wanting some substance.  When I got Sleeping Dogs I wasn't sure what to expect but what I got was a great story and a world that was full of things to do.  The fighting mechanic really cinched it for me.  They took the Rocksteady approach to combat and really made a great game better.  I use guns, sure, but who doesn't want to get in there and use all of those cool fight mechanics and environmental items o take out the targets.  I loved it!  Just excellent sandbox gameplay with a perfect mix of story and action.  I am actually going to buy this for the PC and play it again so that I can get the new DLC.  I rarely play games twice and when a game leaves me wanting more I am surprised.  I really didn't want this game to end but I couldn't quit playing it.  I was an early buyer so it didn't have any of the gameplay DLC yet, only the stuff that added outfits and cars, so now that it has more missions I'm back in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2012"}

Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne continues the saga of Warcraft, with interesting new changes.Each race gets a new hero added to the ranks, as well as several new units.  These new units enhance the races with great new abilities.  Aside from these new units, there are also new items to be found in the game, as well as a few joke items that refer to other Blizzard classics, like Diablo II.  New Creeps are also roaming around the game, waiting to be killed by your heroes!The story continues, and this time it is explained from different perspectives.  In fact, the Alliance campaign and the Dark Elf campaigns are like playing 2 more completely new races, which you will understand once you start playing.  There are also a few hidden features, such as secret levels and other easter eggs that you will have to look hard to find.  Blizzard definitely put alot of time into making a quality product.  There is even a bonus downloadable Orc campaign.  There are only 2 new cinematics, but most of the story is explained through good in-game cutscenes, with some excellent voice acting.Orc fans will be sorely disappointed, as they are flat-out ignored in this expansion.  The Orcs have absolutely no influence or bearing on the story at all, nor are they ever mentioned once in any campaign.  The bonus campaign 'The Founding of Durotar', which details their settling and adjustment into their new lands in Kalimdor, is only one chapter with many, many sub-missions.  Blizzard promises that they will release more chapters to the campaign for download in coming weeks, though it is not clear how many chapters there will be, or how long the wait will be between chapters.  Although the downloadable campaign is a nice feature, it is still very disappointing that the Orcs are blatantly left out of this game's primary story.  The orcs have always been the most popular and more interesting of the races.  To leave them out of the expansion is foolish, and was a bad move on the part of the development team.  The tradition of Warcraft is truly done away with...the war of Orcs and Humans is now over and done with.As is usual with most Blizzard expansions, the difficulty in this game is substantially greater than that of its predecessor.  While not hopelessly difficult, there are some missions that are so frustrating and difficult that even long-standing Warcraft Veterans may find some of the missions too infuriating and outrageously hard to complete.  I personally despised the Undead campaign...to say it was infuriating is a severe understatement.  But persistence and patience will prevail in the end.  As for custom games, they remain unthinkably difficult and should only be played by hardcore and expert Warcraft veterans.I see many who are disappointed in this expansion, and though the exclusion of the Orcs was very disappointing, I see no other reason why.  People seem to expect an entirely new game, but this is an EXPANSION to an existing game...if it were to add 20 new units and a new race and new this and new that, it would be too much.  The purpose of an expansion is to provide more of an existing gameplay experience, while adding a few new things that enhance it overall.  Frozen Throne does that quite well, and i'm very satisfied with it.  Another great game from Blizzard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2003"}

Mauricio","summary":"A showpiece for the next generation of handhelds  (JAPANESE VERSION REVIEW)","reviewText":"The PlayStation Vita sets itself as the next generation of portable gaming. Billed as a PlayStation 3 in the palm of your hands, the Vita aims to bring the next wave of what portable gaming could be. Perhaps the most prolific game to mark this new generation of gaming is Uncharted's first spin-off title, exclusively built for the PlayStation Vita. Uncharted: Golden Abyss is a bold new title that pushes the limit on what the public's perception of what portable gaming can be. A graphic heavy cinematic adventure full of tight action sequences with expansive adventuring through lush and beautiful locations. This isn't your Pokemon or Angry Birds type of game. This is a serious action adventure game that needs to be seen.Though in all honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the Uncharted games. But I have to give credit where its due. Golden Abyss from a technical standpoint left my jaws dropped for its 34 chapters. The amount of detail in this game is so dense, each vista, viewpoint, lookout is a virtual work of art. Though unfortunately, since platforming in Uncharted is more about mere button prompts without the finesse and precision timing, the most boring parts of this game are the platforming segments. That's where I dock off points in the fun level of this game. Thankfully, the shooting segments are still there and are still fun. Controls work tightly and you'll be doing headshots just as proficiently as the console games. You still can only hold 2 weapons at a time but you really don't need more than that to take care of business. Puzzle solving in Golden Abyss takes advantage of the Vita's gimmicks quite well. You'll be rubbing artifacts with the touch screen, inspecting items of interest with the rear touch pad, and even holding your Vita to a light source to inspect cryptic messages inscribed in a parchment. Its very engaging and never gets old, puzzle solving in Golden Abyss sure is a highlight. With multiple control options, Golden Abyss can be suited for any type of player. Want traditional controls in the platforming, you can do that. Want to use touch controls to go through platform segments? Guide Drake with your fingers and he will move in that direction.Uncharted Golden Abyss is an impressive piece technology. Its not perfect though as it lacks any form of multiplayer and the platforming segments are a complete bore. But its campaign is long enough and will keep treasure hunters coming back for more searching for the game's plenty secrets. If not a must buy, it's at the very least, a must try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Not the best Uncharted game, but the best PORTABLE game I've ever played","reviewText":"Without a doubt, this is the best portable game I've ever played, on any handheld. The graphics, sound, and gameplay are all incredible. Some levels, such as when you're paddling upstream in a canoe with Sully, are simply astounding. With my headphones on, I felt an incredible level of immersion, as I was surrounded by the sounds of insects and birds, and the 5\" screen assaulted me with the bright colors of the jungle. Controls are tight, and they work splendidly with the dual analog sticks and the trigger buttons.Though this title is not quite on par with its PS3 counterparts, that is not really a criticism, considering that those are among the most acclaimed games of this console generation. In one regard, \"Golden Abyss\" actually outshines its big brothers: treasure collection. In this game, collecting treasures makes way more sense, and it's fun. There are sets of treasures or artifacts, and each one has a relationship with the other pieces in the set. Collecting them becomes much more meaningful (great for subsequent play-throughs), and they each have detailed descriptions and histories attached to them.My only complaint is about those cursed touch controls, which pop up too often in this game. I don't feel that this is the fault of the developer, as I'm sure Sony forced them to include that nonsense, as well as uncomfortable portions of the game where you must tilt the Vita (sort of like the early days of the Six Axis, when Sony forced developers to implement its features). The strength of the Vita is that it's an alternative to every other device out there, which all use touch controls. The Vita, by contrast, has dual analog sticks and REAL buttons, which work perfectly. Why they want to stray from that at times, and get into the touch controls (which don't work nearly as well) is beyond me. Don't let that minor complaint prevent you from picking this game up, if you own a Vita. This is the best game for the system, in my opinion, and the best portable game I've ever played. It's just fun- plain and simple.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"D.N.","summary":"Pretty good","reviewText":"This is nothing spectacular, they could have used so much more sound files for character voices and the amount of mini-games doesn't really impress, but it's good for a rental when your friends come by on the weekend.

The floating world of Columbia, with its extreme, far-right idealism and frightening inhabitants, makes for one of the most intriguing settings ever seen in any video game. Wrapped together with a strong story that truly becomes mind-blowing towards the end, and Bioshock Infinite is easily one of the defining moments of the seventh generation of console gaming. Releasing near the end of the PS360 era, it serves as a summation of what made this generation's AAA games so unique...memorable, immersive experiences taking place in incredible virtual worlds.Bioshock Infinite's story cannot be discussed in detail without revealing too much. Safe to say that while it seemingly begins down one track, exploring the dark side of American idealism gone horribly wrong, it soon morphs into something completely different. Like the original Bioshock, the game can be horrifying and shocking at times, but it also has moments of beauty that are unsurpassed. Many of these moments are due to your companion throughout the game, Elizabeth, perhaps the most masterfully constructed AI companion to ever appear in a video game. Her innocence, strength, mysterious nature, and audacity lend an emotional weight to the game that is quite engaging. Unlike many other AI companions, she not only takes care of herself, but is also extremely useful during combat scenarios, becoming a huge aide in your quest to discover the truth about what is happening in Columbia.Unfortunately, much like the first Bioshock, combat isn't always the magical experience that exploring Columbia is. It gets rough at spots, with somewhat awkward shooting mechanics, \"powers\" that aren't entirely satisfying, and an opportunity to fight from great heights and speeds thanks to the network of \"skylines\" that connect the various sections of Columbia, an interesting idea that is much more fun in theory than in its execution. Thankfully, the combat is serviceable most of the time, but the combat gameplay never quite reaches the level of some of the finer first person experiences provided to us by the PS360 era. But with Bioshock Infinite, this hardly matters. This is a game where the game world is the star of show. Around every corner of Columbia, there is something fascinating to see, to hear, or to take. It is a dense game world crafted from brilliant, creative minds, and offers some of the most incredible sights and sounds you'll find in any video game. This is a game to be savored. You'll want to stop and smell the roses at every opportunity you can, as doing so is fulfilling and rewarding in a way few games are.Despite its few shortcomings, Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece, through and through. Endlessly fascinating, thrilling, and compelling, games like this don't come around very often. Do not miss it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"So close to excellent, and yet with miles to go","reviewText":"DISCLAIMER:  I've fully played this game on both the PS3 and the PC.  PC specs below.The short version:As a fan of both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I would have been perfectly happy with 'more of the same', and in many ways that's what we get in Arkham Origins.  Most of the game only slightly expands upon the previous two entries.Unfortunately, here we are 6 months later and its biggest detriment is still the bugs--not just annoying glitches but real show-stoppers.  If these could be ironed out, we'd have a 5-star entry in the series that lacks only a bit in the area of storyline and 'new ideas'.  The bugs I report here I have encountered on both the PC and the PS3, and as recently as last week (February 2014).The details:Arkham Origins tells us the story of Gotham City prior to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City storylines.  What makes the story so wonderful is not only some excellent writing that really digs into the depth of Batman and the Joker, and reaches into the mob families that flesh out Batman's world in works like 'The Long Halloween' and 'Dark Victory'...but we also gain insights into a ton of hanging story ideas that were there in Arkham City, making the entire arc of these games seamless.  In Arkham City, you have clues that talk about Black Mask and he's never in the game--why?  Because we get his story here.  Why did Penguin refer in Arkham City to something Batman did to him?  Little details like this add to the magic.  Arkham City also begs the question, \"Why is everything in here blown up and ruined?\" and we get answers to that too.  In fact, it's pretty breathtaking the first time you set foot into the Gotham of Arkham Origins and it's not only whole, it's colorful and lit up for Christmastime.The beginning of the game establishes that right now the cops in Gotham City are really corrupt, and Jim Gordon is one of the few who isn't on the take from mobs and/or supervillains.  It also sets the stage for a mostly-empty city by saying a severe storm has forced evacuation...leaving us with cops and criminals wandering around looking for a fight.Unfortunately, the much larger territory and more open-world feel also take us away from a sense of the story's urgency.  Arkham Asylum walked you on a path to the final battle, and it was a big important fight.  Arkham City played connect-the-dots with the main story elements and its 'Protocol Ten' countdown really built the tension.  Arkham Origins hits you the wrong way at both ends:  storylines swearing you need to act fast aren't affected if you decided to wander around and explore...and at the same time, random police alerts go off on the radio and after the first dozen red-alert alarm calls you start to feel like stopping crimes won't make a difference because 30 seconds later there will be another one demanding you answer it...but not really meaning anything except lost XP if you don't.The Good:We have beautiful graphics on the PCCombat flow is intricate and harder--you really need to take a more defensive stance and be willing to give yourself an edge by using gadgets.The achievement trees are hard to navigate because it appears that you have to knock out most of the achievements in order.The storyline does make the boss battles vary, though for the most part the combinations you use aren't any different from the prior games.We get some great dialog.  For example, (minor spoiler here) that first exchange in which Gordon meets Batman, that we've seen played over and over in movies and books, has Jim basically saying, \"We have a system!\" (and vigilantes don't fit) and Batman calmly responding, \"If your system worked, I wouldn't be here.\"The Bad:Bugs can deny you an achievement.  They can cause the combat flow to come to a halt.  They can punish you for blocking because someone else got inserted in between you and your opponent.  An exciting multiple-takedown move usually starts with Batman popping up in the air, time slowing down...and then there's about a 50/50 chance that the move breaks and nothing happens.  Combat seems far too eager to take guy-with-knife and lock you into having to take him on head-to-head, even when you're ridiculously far away and moving further.  At least one bug has had me finish one of the hardest boss battles I've ever faced, only to be unable to leave the arena.  We've had major fixes released, but this one hit me again just last week.  More than one time I've had to reload a checkpoint and replay to re-earn what I'd rightfully accomplished.  And there are times when someone you're supposed to interrogate simply can't be interacted with--leave the area and/or reload.Really, given that 'more of the same' would make me happy, it's the bugs that make Arkham Origins such a disappointment.The Ugly:It was kind of fun in the earlier games having to take snapshots of clues to answer the Riddler--that has been removed and I suspect it's because it was too hard or required too much Batman knowledge.  We don't have green question marks, so instead we collect green data packets.  Some of the data packets won't be there until you Interrogate one of the bad guys, which can get annoying when the packet in question requires a long one-way walk back through a level you've completed...and in one case the Interrogate suspect never showed due to a bug and I had to keep waiting until another time and checking again until he did make an appearance.  Some of these one-way levels then require you to turn around and go all the way back to leave again.  It tends to turn things into a bit of a rote exercise, and that can be more frustrating when you realize that you're going to need to complete a large chunk of the main story just to be able to try your hand at the puzzles.  I won't spoil the game for you but I will say that one particular large confrontation turns into a nothing of non-battle, no exploration, just a tiny room and words exchanged.  The world is really huge, so they've added a 'fast travel' ability, but you won't be able to fast travel to an area until you've completely taken down a random scattering of items.  Last, playing 'New Game Plus' does NOT give you access to all of the gadgets you earned beating the game, but only those not central to the storyline...this is a shame because I really didn't want to repeat some of the boss battles and now that will be the only way to really get through the side stories, clues, and achievements.All in all, I loved the game enough to play it through twice, but I also found myself far more disappointed when things went wrong: it's like taking delivery of a beautiful Ferrari, only to find that the motor misfires and the Check Engine Light makes constant beeping noises.

{"product_name":"B002C0VNVG","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"A Fine Welcome Home to Gothic Fans","reviewText":"Risen was made by Pirahna Bytes, the same scrappy outfit that put together the first Gothic games, and this is basically Gothic with just a different name.  Like the earlier games, Risen takes a little time to get into, but once you do the rewards are great.  One of the best parts of Gothic and Gothic II was that exploring and being clever are incentivized and rewarded.  In many games, like Oblivion, so much is tied to your level that really you have no incentive to do anything other than level up and hope for the best.  Risen takes this away by scattering the world with treasure chests, rare loot, combinable alchemy items, and a wide array of NPCs that can give you quests, treasure, and experience rewards.  What this means is that there are many ways to develop your character; you can ignore the plots/quests and wander off into the woods, or hole up in the towns and run errands or engage in palace intrigues to get experience and levels.Indeed, like the Gothic games, Risen starts off as a struggle.  You will have poor equipment, terrible fighting skills, few resources, and no idea what is going on.  A single boar or wolf can kill you, and god help you if you wander off the main roads into a cemetery or swamp.  Many people find this challenging learning curve and free form environment frustrating, because you die a lot and do quests \"wrong\" or \"out of order.\"  Who cares?  Gradually, so slowly you may not notice it at first, you get stronger.  By spending precious learning points (earned 10 every level) with NPC trainers, you can increase your combat skills, unlocking new moves and faster ranged attacks.  Spending points on blacksmithing will let you craft sharper swords, reforge pieces of magical weapons you find in the ruins, or even create protective magical jewelry to defend yourself.  Greater strength permits you to both do greater direct damage, and also to use stronger weapons -- the difference between 40 strength and using a bastard sword, and 50 strength and using a sharp two handed sword is far more significant than just the 10 strength difference might suggest.  You also go from clumsily hacking with a sword and being torn to pieces by packs of foes to fluidly sweeping your greatsword in big circles, slaughtering multiple monsters at a time.  But opportunities abound for any style of character -- use a crossbow to anger monsters and then lure them into towns where allies will assist you.  Get up on ledges or in narrow chokepoints to take on enemies one at a time.  Use a wide array of spells to attack, avoid, or outrun foes.Risen's graphics aren't great, and you will see some texture stretching (particularly on hills).  But the gameplay is very rewarding.  By collecting recipes, herbs, and buying Alchemy 3 you can suddenly make dozens of permanent stat boosting potions, and then wield one of those unique swords you picked up in your travels.  The map makes the island look small, but it is riddled with complex cave systems, ruined castles (often with secret passageways or catacombs), elaborate river and swamp systems, and soaring mountain passes.  Areas often have multiple entrances and exits, so if you are daring you can often sneak through places to grab treasure while avoiding particularly dangerous monsters you can't handle yet.  It's hard to overstate the gratification level when, after hours of getting chased around and eaten by black wolves or packs of gnomes, you can finally afford to buy that powerful crossbow or manage to sneak up a hidden river into the mountain and find a berserker sword or rune shield.  Soon monsters that you feared are instead valuable sources of experience points and lootable hides and teeth, and you're on to the next challenge.If you ever played and enjoyed Gothic or Gothic II, you owe it to yourself to play Risen.  Another nice feature for this console port is you can set up hotkey buttons for healing items and the like, often the difference between life and death.  Whether it's sneaking into people's houses at night to steal their loot, tiptoeing around behind stalagmites with your heavy crossbow while a blind Ashbeast pounds the floor all around you, or crushing a horde of skeletal warriors one at a time in the middle of a narrow rope bridge, you will find that the overall experience of Risen vastly exceeds the sum of its parts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"very much refined","reviewText":"RE5 is most definitely a refinement of RE4, that much will be obvious to fans of the series after the first few minutes. But its definitely not a bad thing, RE4 was one of the best games of its time and almost all of its weakness have been improved or fixed in Resident Evil 5. The over the shoulder 3rd person perspective will also be familiar. It is different from most shooters and takes some adjustments. But once you adapt to it you will find a good amount of control and precision to be had. There are frustrations and some of the bosses can be quite annoying, but you feel as if you have accomplished something when you finally beat a particularly difficult fight.You will do more shooting in RE5 than past games, but ammo usage and inventory are as important as ever. The graphics are simply amazing, though much of the blood and gore are a bit over the top at times. The AI for enemies is good, though in single player the AI for your partner suffers at times. Often times she will stand in front of enemy fire and she isn't once to conserve ammunition. That said she does a good job of watching your back. Some players will except the limitations and enjoy while others will use her more as a pack mule and carefully control her inventory. The whole problem is easily resolved when playing with another human in coop mode. Which is where the game really starts to shine. Granted a portion of the ambiance and fear created in the series to date has been the feeling of being utterly alone, which you won't get in this game. But the ability to share in the terror with another player doesn't necessarily lessen it, it just makes it different.I don't think RE5 is a ground breaking entry into the series, but it is a refinement of everything that was good with the last one. Those looking to recapture what made the original great will not find it in RE5. But this game stand on its own as a great entry into the series and more importantly than anything else is very fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004RIACMW","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Glad I stuck with it.","reviewText":"I'll be the first to admit this game starts of slowly. After the first hour, my impression of this game was that it was a cheap, generic, Arkham Asylum knock-off. I came really close to trading it in, but I decided to stick with it.The one thing that makes this game different than many of the others is the use of counter attacks. When an enemy is about to strike you or shoot at you, an indicator will appear on the screen, and if you time your block just right, you'll retaliate with a vicious blow, or knock their bullets right back at them! I thought that was really cool and I had fun doing that.Yes, the combat was borrowed from Arkham Asylum, but it was still fun to fight, nonetheless. I do wish they would have tweaked the combat just a bit though, like maybe allow Captain America to jump in the air. Batman and Captain America are the only 2 action games that I know of that does not make use of a 'jump' button. In most games, the jump button is 'X', in this game, that just makes you roll/dodge. If you've played Arkham Asylum, the combat is pretty much identical. If you have not played AA, just imagine a free-flow combat system that allows you punch, kick, and counter; if all timed correctly, can be a thing of beauty. You are also able to use your shield in combat by throwing it at people, which is very fun to do.The only weapon that Cap uses is his Shield, which is plenty enough. Through upgrades, you'll be able to hit multiple enemies with one throw which will definitely come in handy as you progress through the game.The enemies in the game can be fun to fight at times, but I wish there were more of a variety. I may be wrong, but it seems to be only about 5 or 6 different enemy types, if that. But, this games does shine when it comes to the boss battles. I pretty much died the first few times I had to fight a new boss. You will continue to die until you figure out a strategy to defeat the boss. This is not a hack and slash game where you press the same button over and over to defeat a boss, which is a good thing in my book.Many people have mentioned how short the game is. Well, if you take your time to explore and look for hidden items, you can get about 12 hours out of it. If you just play through without exploring anything and without doing any of the challenges, you'll probably get about 8 or 9 hours.There are a couple of reasons as to why I deducted a star. I really wanted to see a better variety of enemies. Sure, the boss battles were fine, but I kept seeing the same enemies over and over. And also, this game copied AA too much. I'm not saying that was a bad thing, but AA is a unique game with a unique formula, come up with your own formula.I'm glad I stuck with it though; it turned out to be a fun game after all. It's not the type of game that's gonna set the world on fire, so please don't expect that. It's a fun game at a reasonable price that will keep you busy for a few hours, depending on how you play it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel.

Well, this third-party title isn't exactly one of those games. There have been a lack of really good shooter games for Nintendo. While they have had some excellent ones for the Wii, and from the Gamecube eras, they haven't actually shown that strength for the Nintendo DS and the 3DS either. That strain has dropped for hard core shooters getting into the 3DS, to get games like Call Of Duty and others. Nintendo tried their own hands on it with Metroid: Prime Shooters for the original Nintendo DS. While that game was good, the control scheme was lacking. Now, that Maximum Family Games have decided to make their own shooter for the 3DS, the question is do they deliver a really high-quality game.Deer Drive Legends for thew Nintendo 3DS, isn't exactly a game for everyone, yet it isn't actually a strong game either. While the game shows like it is promising, it actually isn't. The gameplay is simple, you're a hunter trying to shoot at hard hitting and raving mad deer to score points for your ranking. The graphics are good, but the control is very sloppy. Instead of it being streamlined, it falls shy because of the clunky controls, and the constant swerving in the gameplay. It can be very harsh and unfortunately, you wind up constantly losing in the game. While you do have your hands in a set of guns from rifle, and to handguns and bullets. You do sometimes constantly get to recharge your guns without realizing you get hit. Not to mention the music is definitely not as interesting. All in all, there was more that was needed to be tuned up and it just wasn't there.Overall, if you are looking for a alternative game for the Nintendo 3DS, Deer Drive Legends 3DS isn't exactly a great game, nor is it really anything worth its while. I actually wasn't impressed with the game, and had really wanted more. If there is going to be another Deer Drive game for any Nintendo system, let's hope that the controls can be better for a more enjoyable game next time around. I would definitely wait for a better shooter to come around that is more worth its money.Graphics: B-Sound: CControl: D+Fun & Enjoyment: COverall: C 1/2-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2012"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"More!","reviewText":"I didn't think they could improve on the original metroid.  I was wrong.  With this remake for the GBA, you get the classic story retold with more detail and more powerups.

This Lite is heavy on features.Available in the Polar White color, Nintendo DS Lite sports two brighter screens with four brightness settings.

Of course, the new handheld still plays all the Game Boy Advance titles available in addition to games made specifically for Nintendo DS.And the built-in Wi-Fi lets you play wirelessly against nearby friends, or you can play online against gamers from around the world with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.Awesome games, great enhancements and an incredible price makes Nintendo DS Lite will be your best acquisition of the year.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fantastic Value in a Gaming System","reviewText":"We owned an original Nintendo DS for two years - we bought it right when it released in December 2004. When I first saw the DS Lite at E3 in 2006, I was thrilled. The game great handheld unit design - but lighter! Brighter! Tuned! It really showed that Nintendo had been paying attention to customer feedback during those two years, and had tweaked its unit to be even better than before.First, the weight. We always *loved* the design of the DS, with its folding top. As PSP owners, I can't tell you how many time that poor PSP screen gets dinged or scratched. We had to buy extra carrying cases for our PSP and get screen protectors. In comparison, the DS's clamshell design means the screen is perfectly protected when you tote it around in your pocket or purse. The only down-side was that it was a bit heavy. With the DS lite, they keep the protection of the clamshell and also lighten up the unit significantly. It really does help a lot.The screen brightness - with it being *adjustable* - is an incredibly helpful update. Sometimes you're playing outside in very bright light. Sometimes you're playing in full dark, staying awake in bed. There are all levels in between. If you need that brightness, you don't care if you're burning up your battery power. If you do NOT need that brightness, why kill your battery for no reason? Having that ability to adjust really means that your battery works as best as it possibly can.We play several games that use the microphone, like Brain Age, and it definitely helps to have it in the center. Usually you're holding the unit with both hands, centered on your face. To have your mouth pointed right at the microphone helps out greatly with those games.In general the DS system is a fantastic handheld gaming system. We have both the DS and PSP and we play both frequently. Many of the games on the DS aren't available on the PSP and are a ton of fun. The Brain Age / Big Brain Academy / similar games stand out as games we enjoy daily. There are many other games that use the DS touch screen extremely well, giving a full interactivity of gameplay. Yes, the PSP has better graphics. It's something that the DS compromised on. They have less detailed graphics, but more interactivity. Both are great for the games they offer. So for example we play flight simulator style games on our PSP, where the high end graphics matter, and we play puzzle / platform / thinking games on the DS, where the interactivity and plot is more key.I highly recommend the DS Lite for anybody who doesn't have a DS yet - whether you have a PSP or not. It's not an either-or situation. It's like having a stereo and a TV set. They're both great for their own reasons, and most people would enjoy having both.If you HAVE a Nintendo DS already and are wondering if you should get a Lite, it really depends on how much you use it away from home. The primary benefit here is the lighter carrying weight, smaller size and much better battery life. If you're carrying it in your pocket, purse or backpack every day, I would really recommend getting a Lite. You can always give your original DS away to a friend or relative as a present, or sell it on eBay. The DSs are still in high demand and would be much loved by a new recipient.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}

Xenogears2.  Xenosaga series3.  Nier4.  Planescape: Torment5.  Final Fantasy XThis game is a MASTERPIECE when it comes to the story and never have I seen a game tell its story the way Nier does.  Basically you play through the game, then have the opportunity to play through it again.  And playing through it again is NOT just the same story with a different ending, prepare to have your eyes opened and to be hit in the gut ad you experience it all from a new perspective.  It's very emotional and amazing.So I made it clear, the story of Nier is original and incredible.  What about everything else?  Well, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard and the voice acting it out of this world.  Not everything is as amazing though.  The world is kind of small and there is a LOT of back tracking through the same locations over and over.  The side quests can be a terrible grind for little reward, but some of them tell great stories too so it's worth it to push through.  The game isn't perfect, but the story is so good this game MUST be played.And I will say this final statement:  If you put in the time to play through Nier once and watch the final credits, you are doing yourself the ULTIMATE disservice if you do not do the Newgame+ feature.  Actually you could say you haven't even beaten the game or seen the story unless you have at least played through twice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B003DNLDUC","description":"","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"Fun game with some caveats","reviewText":"This game has been criticized by some reviewers for being repetitive, for having enemies look all the same (as opposed to in the movies, where they look...all the same?) and one reviewer (Game Informer) went so far as to criticize it because the enemies get harder.In my opinion, the game can get a bit repetitive, (although it is a hack and slash, and I would think  someone picking up a hack and slash would understand there's a certain level of grind involved) and although the graphics are very lush, the enemies do kinda look all the same, although I really didn't care that much about that peculiar quirk. I'm not even going to dignify the complaint about difficulty scaling. As the game progresses, it gets harder, ok? If you want to god-mode it up, go re-play the first stages of the game. Also, the game DOES allow you to grind beyond what should be 'at level' for the current content.The bigger issue going on with this game would be the glitches. Some are minor, such as sound stuttering. Some are a bit lame, such as not being able to land crits, at all.  And some, are just really infuriating. Such as not being able to progress through the story after a certain point.I bought the game on release, I was really gung ho about it, and about  a few days in, I got stuck in Mirkwood. I was not able to progress the story at about the halfway point of the game. I found a quick fix online- apparently some people in the same situation were getting through the glitch by joining a co-op match. So I did, and it worked. And then I got stuck by a similar glitch on the next stage.The game came out  a month ago, and I haven't played it in about 3 weeks. What's more frustrating is that Snowblind is well aware of these and many more glitches, and they are supposedly currently working on a patch. Have been working. On a patch. For 3 weeks to a month.Truth be told, this game was meant to be a fun game to play while I waited for other games to come out later this year. Most of those games have come out now. I would have liked to finish this game (and probably will once Snowblind lets me) but not being able to really puts a downer on the entire experience.I would say, buyer beware.5/7/2012 Post-Patch update: I have picked this up again, finally finished it, saw there's a +Game feature, which I'm a fan of. All in all, it's a fun game, but even after the patch I'm still  seeing that the game will, at random, delete random quests from my open quest log (example, in the Barrens, found the Athelas, kept questing, turned it off, came back a bit later, went back to the camp, and found out I didn't have that quest any more...really frustrating)From what I've read in the forums is that the \"fix\" or work around is simply to quit the game, and reload it, and voila, the missing quest should be there. This work around works, but then you're subjected to the really long load times.  Better than nothing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0047ODJAI","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Dead Space 2... the nightmare revisted","reviewText":"Below I will have 2 sets of reviews..  one for the game.  one for the CE additions you pay $20 for...___ Dead Space 2: The game ___Dead space 2 picks up some time after the original and literally seconds after Dead Space: Ignition.  From that point on this game pulls no punches and puts the cheesy scares behind for some downright terrifying segments.  Being this game plays out like the first, where you mainly see Issac's view supplemented by various logs you find, I don't blame Issac for being crazy!  From the moment the game starts you are put on the roller-coaster and there just doesn't seem to be an end in sight.Graphics: Fantastic compared to Dead Space.  The back of the box lists 1080i as the resolution but this actually is a miss-print.  The game is 1080p and looks fantastic.  Dark, spooky , flickering lights.  Blood and weapon effects.  They are well polished and you can tell they put a lot of effort into making this game look good. If a room is pitch black it was meant to be pitch black.  Monsters are well detailed, and Issac has a much more fluid setup this time.  He no longer moves clunky which helps with aiming plus making his movements feel more natural and realistic to the playerSound/Story: The atmosphere is great. They didn't hold back with the voice acting and ambient sound.  You walk into a room and hear some glass break yet see nothing.  Echo's down halls and footsteps through the duct-work.  Everything is well polished and sets you up for a scary, horrifyingly good time.  The storyline is fairly good, with Issac having more of a say in the story this time.  That's right folks, Issac can talk now.  I won't ruin the storyline with the review but I think it definitely adds more dimension to the overall tale being told here.Gameplay: The gameplay is smooth and that goes with the presentation and graphics and audio.  Everything meshes well together and while a few things might irk the dedicated Dead Space player (new controls take some time to get used to) they work out for the best.  The new weapons are a blast and the suit designs are very nice.  There are a multitude of ways to kill mobs now ; simple killing, dismember a limb and impale them, plant mines, stick em with a javelin then fry the mob walking by the pinned mob.  There also appears to be a few different methods to attacking rooms (way mobs spawn/trigger).  Another prime example of the gameplay polish is audio logs don't just spring up and play. You have to hit select to play them.  Also your \"objective location\" line from the first game now can locate SAVE, OBJECTIVE, STORE and BENCH locations.  A very nice feature.Length/Replay:  The chapters come across shorter than the first game, but I feel there is more content here at the same time.  It is concentrated you could say.  Not nearly as much downtime, but keep in mind there is 15 chapters I believe.  Dead Space had 12  so said +3 chapters makes up for the quicker paced chapters.  Overall I think the game clocks in at about the length of Dead Space if my calculations are correct.  The replay value is through the roof once again; Game+ modes  plus you have tons of difficulties to test out, let alone items seem better hidden this time (or so I am finding). Mainly logs and kind of bonus stuff.Overall: This game is a big hit in my book.  If you loved the 1st game this game easily will top  your expectations.  It brings everything Dead Space had plus throws on a helping of Necromorph icing and delicious scare/horror cookies.  This game gets a 95% in my book (A) and is a must have for any Dead Space fan  or survival/horror buff.___ Collector's Edition ___For $20 extra you get lots of goodies like you should expect from a CE.  I will break down the goodies by how I feel, influences your $ spent1. Lithograph ( 10 pts)  - This must be worth maybe... $0.10  its just a glossy image on a sheet of paper.  Single Sided and honestly not all that memorable.  It just shows you the necro-morph transformation steps2. Official Sound track ( 85 pts) - This is pretty good.  I'd say maybe $4.99 - $6.99 in value comes in a nice little DS2 CE sleeve and contains 18 tracks.  The audio quality is very good and the music already got me pumped for some DS2 action!3. DLC content ( 80 pts) - Pretty good again, as your code will unlock a Zealot Force Gun and Suit  (probably a $2.99 - $3.99 value)  These are CE only items as you can not buy them through the PSN store (but EA does tend to change their mind)4. Dead Space 2 Video game - I hope your box has a game in it ^_^ hehe (all CE editions contain the LIMITED EDITION version of the game)5. Dead Space Replica Plasma Cutter (85pts)-- This is actually MORE than I expected.  I knew it was just going to be 6in and had no fully movable parts (the one at the E3 show was an exact replica / demo)  The plasma cutter is pretty simple looking, nothing fancy.  It has a flashlight on it, and 3 LED's for aiming.  There is two problems I have however.  NO BATTERIES?!?!?  On top of no batteries the screw being used to hold the covering for the batteries requires an eyeglass screw driver.  The device takes 2 AAA  batteries.  The other is, the aimer doesn't pivot like in the video game.  So you are stuck using it the \"primary\" fire mode way.-- Aside from that the replica is pretty nifty.  It comes with a resealable plastic bag (zip lock) and once the batteries are installed, there is a white LED flashlight on the side that illuminates.  3 tiny Green LED lights for the aiming beams.  The trigger gives a reassured \"click\" when pressed and feels sturdy.-- Overall this is awesome!  I wasn't expecting this to be made of metal or aluminum let alone be a full working model like people were hoping for. That would of been a $120 CE like the Killzone 3 Collectors Edition. This is what it is...a nice little piece to keep handy in case some necromorphs decide to storm in on your DS2 play time6. Dead Space Extraction (100 pts) - are you kidding me?!  A free  100% full game with 100% move support!  Nuff said  (the graphics are also remastered in 720p  vs the 480p the Wii had)overall the CE scored 360 points, however I am eliminating the lithgraph from the score netting it 350pts.  Over 4 items that is a 87.5 or B+ score.*** This CE is well worth $20 extra.  A replica plasma cutter... a DLC exclusive suit and gun..  The OST... and a FULL GAME!  Seriously... you get 2 games in this box with a CE.  Even without the replica, DLC and OST  that's just $20 for  Dead Space Extraction  If you are on the edge, pick up the CE.**NOTE:  However, the CE edition for the Xbox360 and PC  I would be hesitant about.  If you remove the 100pts earned by literally having a free game for the PS3, you end up with 260 pts and I am now INCLUDING the lithograph since 360 and PC copies do not get a free game... That scores you a 65  or a D+.  At this point now it is pretty much a \"PASS\"  The only thing even worth getting your hands on is the Replica as the DLC and OST are negligible in the long run.  So if you are going to get the PS3 version, the CE is worth your money simply because you get Extraction free of charge.  If you get the PC or 360 versions, Skip the CE and get the Regular edition******EDIT 1/29/2011There is some confusing about the Limited Edition vs the Collectors Edition vs the Regular partially to blame is EA as they didn't go out of their way to mention the differencesREGULAR COPY of Dead Space 2 =  Dead space 2 retail +  DEMO of Dead Space Extraction ($59.99)LIMITED EDITION of Dead Space 2 =  Dead space 2 + FULL copy of Dead Space extraction ($59.99 limited prints many places already are selling out)COLLECTORS EDITION of Dead Space 2 = LIMITED EDITION + DLC + Plasma Cutter Replica + Official Soundtrack + Lithograph of Art ($79.99)The PC and 360 versions  do not contain Dead Space Extraction (Sony PS3 exclusive)Dead Space Extraction currently is a $23.99 retail value (however you can probably find it cheaper looking at independent sellers. I've seen it as low as $9.99 but as high as $26.99)** It was brought to my attention (see comments) that Dead Space extraction is now available on the PSN for just $14.99.  Not a bad price seeing as how the Wii version is retailing for $29.99 , on sale for $23.99","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0085L2T0A","description":"","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"Are you ready to lay the smack down with THQ for the final time? Oh Hell Yeah!","reviewText":"THQ first burst onto the scene of wrestling games back in the late 90's when they released one of the best wrestling games of the time, WCW vs NWO. They got even better with it's follow up WCW vs NWO Revenge, and the more fans screamed for things to be added, the better THQ got, especially when they lost the rights to WCW and picked up the WWE and have held onto the rights up until this 2013th year. It was the Nintendo 64 smash hit No Mercy that took THQ to new heights by creating what some still consider to this day to be the best wrestling game ever. But the transition to newer consoles was a great but rough ride, but improving on a lot of things with each new game. The smackdown series on PS1 where good for the day, but are a mess when you look at them now, but they redeemed themselves when they made the first 3 smackdown games on the ps2. From there the famous Smackdown vs Raw games commenced, from the first on being developed in 2004, up till 2010, then they dropped the title and simply went with WWE 12. Now, in one final effort, how does the final THQ wrestling game come off?I have been a big fan of the SvsR games, but each one of them I had complaints about, as well as praises. But it looked as tho all THQ where worrying about was improving graphics when it came to SvsR 2009 and 2010. Many glitches, bugs and not much of a fun factor to be found with those updates, so much so I didn't even bother to play 12. I did however play 11, and they improved alot, but it still lacked in a lot of things.Now on the PS3. THQ have made their final WWE game. Unless they get the contract back later. Sure enough, they did put quite a lot of effort into this one. I did not play 12, so I can't compare it, but from what I have heard, I shouldn't even bother going backwards to 12 compared to 13.Sure enough, the graphics have been improved. As does it always in each release. And this time they have apparently added back the moves that people where ticked off about in 12 because it lacked in so many of them. However, this game does have a lot of moves not present, but for the most part, you should be able to find just about anything you desire to do.As usual, the exhibition matches are present. From 1 on 1, 2 on 2, 3 on 3, 6 man, whatever and customizable match condiations. TLC, Tables, Hardcore, Cage, Cell, Chamber, Scramble, Gauntlet, Rumbles,  inferno and all that from the past games are back again. What is not here from past games is Buried Alive, Pillow Fights and two things we have wanted, but have never been done is Ambulance and survivor series 4 on 4.Most things have remained the same as SVR2011. A few small changes have been made to inferno, hell in a cell, and rumble/over the top eliminations. But what hasn't been changed for the better is customizing rules in rumbles/royals to allow you to pin or exit the ring... nor has turning off KO in backstage fights. WHY? Oh, and neither has the men vs women is forbidden rubbish... but there is a codebreaker code for that at least.The main feature is Attitude mode. You get to participate in classic matches from the Attitude era. Starting off from he Rise of DX, to the rise of Stone Cold, The Rock, Mick Foley and then a few other random moments. Its not bad, it's fun. Can be tricky at times. But some details where left out, and that was disappointing... no mention of DX running to the ring to help Mick Foley win his first championship, just Stone Cold. Nor the moment when DX was born. I guess the WWE really do not want any footage of Chyna to be seen? During these matches, you can have a task to do, if you want, which will unlock something. These things might be something as simple as hit your finisher, or hit someone with a chair at a certain time. Others might be whack someone with a chair 100 times or do a whole heap of things in a set time limit. Nothing is overlay challenging, about the hardest I found was getting Chris Jericho to do the walls of Jericho then powerbomb them through the table. But you work it out eventually.Whats' surprisingly lacking is a few huge attitude moments that don't even get a mention. Chyna is not present at all in the game. Neither is Sable. I can understand Chyna, but what have they got against Sable now?Creating superstars has been improved a bit. Not a great deal more has been added, but you should be able to create what you want. A cool new feature tho is you can create your own drawing and use it. I think it may have already been introduced in past SVr games or 12, but this is the first one ive played on PS3.. having moved on from the PS2. It's allowed quite a lot of talented people to make better looking custom superstars who look more realistic then the generic stuff you have to work with. More announcer names have been included then ever before, yet that lacks when it comes to actual in game commentary names, which is a shame. It bugs me tho why so many names are in it, but the ones you really want are left out. There is a lack of names to match legends of the past, yet just about every Mortal Kombat name you can think of can be made! Making multiple attires is easier than ever before tho!As usual, you can also create entrances, and move sets. Create your own moves (2 maximum per wrestler tho) and also create your own arena... as well as story mode and belt.The coolest thing is now you can use your own mp3's as a entrance theme. Shame you can't pick one for each attire or an entrance and exit theme. It's also a shame so many entrance animations have not been included... pretty much just about everything is of an actual wrestler from the past. hardly any custom ones. (I miss the tricycle entrance)There is a fair amount to unlock. Some worth while, some a load of rubbish.I guess the reason I don't give the game 5 stars is because of so much that I expected to be in this game, but was not.Here we go with cons.- Glitches. There is quite a lot of them. Some are fun, but when the game freezes when changing participants in a Universe match. Irritating.- Nothing really new to play in. I don't know what more could be done, at least what the WWE would allow. But some sort of new matches would have been great.- Missing moves. Some moves I wanted are just not in the game. And then, some I did want, are available for DLC, which just makes you wonder why they were not just put in the game in the first place without having to download them?- Lack in announcer name choices. Why can you have during the entrance, but not during the match?- Lack of being able to create your own ring. They have the perfect chance now to add something great, where you can make your own ring. Pick the size, then the shape (TNA dont hold copyright on hexagon rings) then choose rope types.... wrestling/boxing/barbwire/no ropes. Then be able to create a cage around the ring. Even choose what side of the cage has what kind of cage? One side could be old school bars, the next new style mesh, the next is chain squared thingies, and the next could be a brick wall? Also, a choice of a roof on the cage? Be able to monkey bar to the middle and drop on your opponent. Dont stop there, also be able to create the cages around the barriers (hell in a cell) and have the same sort of options for each panel there. Could be cool to be able to have a cage match where instead of the cage being around the ring, you have to climb over an outside the ring hell in a cell structure to win. Be even cooler if you could create the cage around the ring AND the hell in a cell around it. Perhaps with no roof? A cage match where you have to escape two cages. Or even have a cage, surrounded by a hell in a cell, but ontop of the cell you can create another cage, with a cage on-top of that that contains the belt... or on top of that cage is a ladder. The possibilities in creating great new matches like that would be endless. Especially if you can add flames around the cages or even ontop of the cages.- Options to choose match options freely. No more set options in rumbles or what not. If you wanna take on 40 guys and have to make everyone submit or KO, then so be it. Bring back the freedom of No Mercy's options.- better, and I mean MUCH BETTER backstage areas. Including the above options thing. Bring back the great backstage areas like in the original Smackdown games where you could go to the parking lot, outside, subways, down town new york, hang off helicopters etc...- Create your own taunt.- Create your own submission move- Create your own other moves.- Create your own tag/trio/faction entrances (individual characters one at a time) If I want one guy to come out and flip the crowed off, while another comes down from the scaffold of the ceiling and another walks to the ring through the crowed... why should I be able to?)- Faction vs Faction matches/storyline/modes- Able to use your own video for an entrance screen- More weapons/or create your own weapons? Draw it, decide how it interacts, then use it.- Ability to beat up the commentators. The shut up when you hit them.- Go into the crowed. (tho, you can do this via a glitch)- Bring back the hardcore areas above the top right of the screen in normal matches- Allow more hotspots and things to do in the entrance areas. Especially being able to throw your opponent of stage. And personally, I wanna be able to climb the Titantron and take off.- Be able to go backstage at anytime from the arena (even if it's only in one match type)- More environment to interact with.- Scaffold Matches (after Owen Harts mishap, I doubt WWE would ever allow it)- DLC worth downloading.- Mini games? (I dunno, be able to go backstage and play basketball... hehehe maybe not?)- a training ring backstage somewhere, so when you're in a falls count only in the ring, but no count out, if you go backstage, there is another ring you can pin in... that could be a whole new match by itself)- Choose your own things that need to be done before a match can be completed.What else would you like to see?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2013"}

It was difficult to stop playing to write this review. Instead of swapping gems to match them. you now rotate them. They have added some new twists as well, such as \"Fire Jewels\" and even \"Bomb Jewels\" that are on a timer and must be matched before the timer runs out. It doesn't click seconds though, but moves. Each move takes one off the clock. This is Five Star across the board and great for the whole family.

{"product_name":"B001G8M738","reviewerName":"R. Nicholson","summary":"An interesting addition to the Bejeweled family of  matching games","reviewText":"This game is the latest addition to the Bejewel line of games from \"POPCAPS\".The original 'Bejeweled' was a game of match 3, 4 or 5 jewels while trying to obtain a higher and higher scores as the game progressed in difficulty. 'Bejeweled Twist' adds several new options to the old game. The main difference is in movement of gems; in the original game you moved the gem laterally or up/down to make a match, but in B. Twist you turn 4 gems 90 degrees resulting is more combinations and also more unexpected result.Some other things I liked:1.)A very pleasant and catchy electronic tune plays continually in the background; in all the times I've played, I've never become annoyed or irritated by this melody. (it can, however, be turned off) The graphics/videos and audio effects (explosions etc.) are outstanding.2.)The old game ended if no match was available (who can ever forget \"NO MORE MOVES\" as your last desperate attempt to continue a game failed). However, in this game you always have a move; losing involves having a gem that has turned into a time bomb go off before you can destroy or defuse it. This can be very intense as the music pace increases and the bomb start to vibrate and smoke as the counter ticks down towards zero with each successive move .3.)Every move that makes a match, evokes a multiplier system that allows score to be gradually increased up to a factor of 10x, resulting in potentially incredible high scoring combos; it's very motivating to try to obtain these increasingly larger and larger multipliers.4.)'Special' gems are awarded once the 10x multiplier level meter is reach and filled twice, resulting in a rare, but astronomical scoring opportunity.5.)In addition to the regular 'Bejeweled Twist' matching game there are several other features; a Zen game (unending, no bombs and no tension), a Blitz game (5 minutes to get a new high score) and a Challenge game (where you need to accomplish certain goals to continue).Conclusion:A truly interesting addition to the Bejewel family of games; very addicting.Easily worth every cent of the less than $20.00 you pay to purchase.5 Stars.Ray Nicholson","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2008"}

Griffith","summary":"Great Zombie Game","reviewText":"I just finished it, including every side-quest, and therefore I can say I saw everything this game offers. And I should tell you - this is a great game. The story is not on a forefront, but there is a book already, which fleshes it out a bit. If to consider the story as a combination of a game and a book, it is actually a pretty interesting sci-fi thriller. We have cannibalism, international conspiracy, and a threat of pandemic at the end. It might look in the beginning that things do not make too much sense, but take it easy and wait for the third act (in the jungle), and everything will become clear.The game is beautiful, btw. The resort location is gorgeous, the city of Moresby is horrible but in an awesome kind of way, and the jungle, with its biochemical lab complex and an ancient burial ground, native villagers, and rebel hideouts is simply terrific.Killing zombies is fun, but probably not for everyone. It is kinda cruel, definitely not for kids.Character development is nice, though leveling-up never feels as an accomplishment, bec. zombies are getting stronger faster, and so the game is getting harder. But no worries, when you die all you have to do is to wait for 7 seconds, and loose some money. The progress in the game is not lost. This system worked well for me, no saves were ever corrupted. So everyone can reach the end.It took me 47.5 hours to finish it, and I did not get all collectibles. So the game is fairly long. Overall, this game was a very pleasant surprise.

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A five star game that gets four, because when compared to its near-perfect predecessors, it's hard not to be let down a bit","reviewText":"My review title really says everything I want to say about this game.Dark Souls II is amazing. But because it's not the 10/10 game that Demon's Souls and Dark Souls were, it's hard not to be a tad bit disappointed.Why isn't it on the level of its two forefathers? It's hard to say. Hidetaka Miyazaki wasn't at the helm of this game, like he was with the previous two games in the series. But honestly, my thoughts are that the reason is because Dark Souls II tried too hard to be a mix of its predecessors. While in theory this isn't a bad idea, I think the game ended up tripping over itself a bit at times. The game features an inter-connected world marked by bonfires serving as checkpoints, just like Dark Souls did. Yet it also brings back the concept of a \"hub\", a separate area where the player goes to level up, visit blacksmiths & vendors, interact with NPC's, and most importantly, fast travel anywhere, just like Demon's Souls did. So where as the world of Dark Souls felt like a brilliant, cohesive whole (which it was), Dark Souls II's world never feels that way. And at the same time, Dark Souls II's individual areas never feel quite as distinct and brilliantly designed the way Demon's Souls did. Part of this may have to do with the designers' desire to make this game more Demon's Souls-esque than Dark Souls was, but ultimately, it's the level design itself that is to blame. The level design is fantastic still, with some incredibly memorable locations. But it never really reaches the heights of the previous games, which is a shame.With that said, there is no denying that Dark Souls II is a still a wonderful game. If Demon's Souls and Dark Souls didn't exist, this game would be revolutionary. In fact, despite my 4 star rating, this game is still better than almost anything else out there. It's sure to be considered in any worthwhile Game of the Year conversation for 2014. It even does some things significantly better than previous entries in the Souls series. Most notably, it accomplishes the absolutely incredible feat of becoming a much more transparent, accessible game, while at the same time not losing an ounce of the depth, challenge, and high levels of player satisfaction that the series has been known for. Esoteric game mechanics like the covenants (which are still present, but much easier to understand and utilize), world tendencies, and navigation are a thing of the past. Dark Souls II is approachable and easy to get into, yet as difficult as ever to master. In this reviewer's opinion, the leveling system overhaul in Dark Souls II has been an extremely positive change for the series, allowing for greater player flexibility without the need to level grind, and adding consequences for those who do choose to grind. And most notably, the multiplayer features are much richer, easier to use, and much more fun in general. Multiplayer in the Souls series has always been arguably the most innovative around, offering a game within a game for those who choose to take part in it. Dark Souls II does the best job of this yet.And like I mentioned earlier, this is still a Souls game. Meaning you're going to have some of the most immersive, intense, and satisfying gameplay available anywhere. Perhaps Dark Souls II's level & world design aren't as masterful as Dark Souls'. Perhaps its enemies and bosses aren't as memorable as Demon's Souls'. That's irrelevant. Dark Souls II is a must-play game no matter what. And the best news is, that despite it perhaps not being quite as perfect as its predecessors, this is still the best place for a newcomer to the series to start. It does a fantastic job of easing the player into its world and allowing them to figure out what's going on without holding the player's hand. For that alone, this game deserves to be commended. And Dark Souls II continues to solidify what so many of us already know....that this Souls series, from developers extraordinaire From Software, is the best thing to happen to video games in a very, very long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2014"}

I had a spare usb keyboard laying around but it was not compatible with my PS3. I had remembered seeing one of these keypad thingies at Wal-Mart, however no local stores seem to carry them. I cam to amazon and found one 3rd party version of it for about half the price of the Sony model so I bought it. I was not pleased with that particular item so I returned it for the much more expensive one that you're viewing right now. This thing really makes entering text a breeze and as far as it's functionality as a keyboard/text entry device I have no complaints. My gripe is with all the added features which I'm guessing they only added because they wanted more features to list on the packaging. The mouse is completely useless. I have been unsuccessful at using it since the get-go. To boot, the PS3 doesn't download a patch or anything so that you can change settings like mouse speed or sensitivity or really anything. It's just stuck at it's default and the mouse is way too sensitive, it moves when you're not even touching it and when you are the cursor acts like what happens when you try using two fingers on a touchpad for a laptop.The other place that this device is severely lacking is INSTRUCTIONS. It comes with little more instructions than a very brief piece of paper hidden in the packaging card that basically says just this; \"erm... turn meh ohn den charge meh... i liek sink automatically then use me, goo sony!\"I still have yet to figure out what half the buttons that aren't letters do. For some reason pressing shift does not capitalize your letters and neither does the caps lock button. Overall, for chatting where punctuation and grammar don't count for much this device is very good at what it does. It syncs to the PS3 just like a controller but I have yet to be able to check it's charge level like you would a controller. Which isn't a major thing but when you add it to all the other problems you get from this thing it leaves you wondering why in the world you ever paid so much for this thing.As far as it hooking onto the controller the mechanism is really simple, the keypad is set a little too far away and it makes entering text sorta difficult but I have small hands and short thumbs some of you guys out there with big lengthy manhands should do fine with it. I usually just leave the thing completely off the controller and I can enter text quite efficiently. The PS, START and SELECT buttons just fit over your existing ones but they work really well provided your keypad is set on the controller properly. Personally, I wouldn't buy another one of these not when you can get a full blown BT keyboard for a little more which I imagine would be quite a bit more functional than this thing.Overall it's good at what you need it for and not so good at all the added stuff or just totally useless at it anyways. I think it would be a nice idea for Sony to do a lite version of this where all it does is simple text entry with functional shift and caps lock buttons for a much lower price. But as I think this product has all but been taken off the market I doubt that will ever happen for this generation of the console. If you're frustrated with the digital text entry and don't want to drop the 80+ bucks on a PS3 keyboard then I would suggest this over any other piece of equipment. If you're used to QWERTY text messaging you will have no problems using this device. For more frugal shoppers I suggest the 3rd party model which is a lot cheaper but doesn't look or fit as good on your controller.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

For a shooter, this game has you making decisions on the fly, sneaking around at times, running and gunning at others. Each mission has side tasks to accomplish, such as killing twelve people with twelve bullets without reloading, for example. The squad acts and fights intelligently around you if you play single player. The missions themselves each have multiple parts to them, and range from search and rescue to seek and destroy type missions. About half require no alert to be sounded in at least part of them. The shooting itself is crisp and on point. It's pretty satisfying sneaking up on enemy soldiers and either slitting their throats or shooting them in the head from behind.There were some especially intense moments, such as rescuing a Chechnian soldier and then fighting your way out through soldiers with camo and snipers who had RPG's as well. The last mission...I died lots trying to get though it. Also, some of the missions have timed parts to them. I usually dont like that format, but in this game, it really worked. You cant afford to find the best cover and kill people at a leisurely pace. It forces you to really get your hands dirty and hone your shooting skills.The story is also pretty gripping in my opinion. Not at all the afterthought of a BF3, for example.I played the beta multiplayer, but havent jumped onto the servers yet since buying the game, although That is next on my agenda. Guerilla mode however, is super challenging. My friend and I were only able to make it through 12 waves before dying in co-op.Anyway, I have really enjoyed this game quite a bit so far, and I expect MP will e lots of fun as well.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Live Player \"GAMERFIDE\"","summary":"Wow great shooter!","reviewText":"Ive been playing games for a long time specifically FPS(first person shooters) I play a lot on xbox live games like battlefield two and rainbow six, and let me say that even though this game does'nt have multiplayer I am going to take a stab and say it is better than Half life 2. Wether you know half life 2 or not, it was a game that took home all the awards and I believe that BioShock will trounce it.To start off if you havent played the demo on xbox live, play it, and if thats not enough to convince you to go buy it right away, rent it, thats what I did, im on my second week renting it from blocbuster and im going to buy it. The games so huge and whats even cooler is you can go back at any time and take care of things you might have missed or to get things like ammo that you dodnt need then but you need now, yep it will still be there. I hate it when that perverbial door closes behind you and you cant go back to get something you were saving or maybe you just went the wrong way, but nope cant go back cause there is a door or a fence, but not in this game. It is so cool that when I went back to 2 levels ago that some machine gun rounds or a health kit was sitting right where I left it.The graphics are the some of the best Ive seen in a shooter so far the lighting, the detail, just the whole original-ness of everthing is awesome, its not another ww2 shooter which they have really played out lately. Everything in this story, in this world is new and unexpected, the enemy is smart, you can grow your character make him stronger, you can upgrade your weapons, invent new items, you can hack security robots and make them work for you. One of the coolest things is that over time your character can evolve and gain new powers like telekenesis(moving objects by thought) which comes in very handy to like catch a grenade that an enemy is throwing at you and hurl it back at him, or grab those hard to reach powerups.Theres lots of game for your buck like I said ive been playing for almost two weeks now and am still pretty far from beating the game, course I like to take my time, being a long time RPG(role playing game) player I like to find every little secret, and take in every little detail of the game, so that I can beat it right the first time.Trust me ive been playing games since the atari and coleco vision era and I know games(pretty sad huh?) but if you buy it, rent it, whatever just play it; trust me you wont be dissapointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2007"}

It's difficult sometimes, but I always try not to judge games based upon release hype. I have had a 360 for about a year and a half, and usually buy all the major releases, especially if they get positive reviews from users on sites like this (I don't put much stock in \"professional\" reviewers or game magazines, because they are usually beholden in some way to the publisher).With all that said, this game is fair. The graphics are, indeed very good. The control scheme is very different, and takes some getting used to. Once you get it down, you can indeed scale big buildings jump across rooftoops and all that. But my two disappointments are:1. Why is this rated \"M\"? There's hardly any blood.2. I dislike any \"Freeform\" game that frowns on killing innocents. I don't bother them all the time; but I do like knowing I can, if I want to be \"evil.\"3. I make this complaint in most of my reviews, and I'm going to repeat it here (and in a couple of new reviews I'm planning to write)-with today's modern games, all that technology, advanced programming next gen blah blah yada yada yak yak WHY CANT THERE BE A QUICKSAVE?????? Why do we have to be subjected to \"checkpoints\" and \"autosaves?\" It is frustrating as HELL to get almost to the end of a level, get killed and have to start again from the \"checkpoint\" miles, or an hour back. STOP IT!So, except for the facts that it's not freeform enough, not gory enough, and has no quicksave, Assasins Creed is fair. I didn't see any glitches, and don't mind the \"Bruce Lee Movie\" style attacks (e.g. twelve guys attack you, and each wait politely till you kill the guy you're fighting with before they attack), because I'm not so good at combat and would get killed more. I would not recommend buying without renting first.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2007"}

The graphics are REALLY BAD. But I thought: as long as the story engages me, I'll give it a pass on the graphics department. The game is plagued with loading screens left and right and that definitely ruins the flow, even to open a simple door. The first time I killed  a monster, the game tried to log into Dragon Age online servers to upload my recent \"accomplishment\" and froze up. Then I disabled the whole online thing to prevent more issues. Played for about an hour more, the story was barely OK. I could come up with a more intriguing plot for the origins of a medieval wizard in 15 minutes. Instead they went for the good ol' training school that looks no different that a blacksmith school or a ballet school. Just a plain old run of the mil....school, found in dozens of other games like fable 1 and so on. After an hour of gameplay (Nothing special, even thou I have to admit I was starting to enjoy enjoy my freezing spell, I tried to open a door in the mage's headquarters, just to be treated to another of dozens of loading screens and the game froze again.

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"I'm in Nintendo Heaven! :')","reviewText":"You know, ever since the original Super Smash Bros, it was unbelievable to imagine several of Nintendo's franchises coming together and beat the ever-loving heck out of each other. The result was one of the best multiplayer experiences around. Then Melee came by and improved upon every single aspect of the original, as well as introducing things like Events, an Adventure Mode, and an All-Star mode. OH MY GOD!!! WHAT THE HECK IS BRAWL GONNA BRING US?! Just keep reading and you'll be shocked (That is, if you don't already own the game).Already, the character lineup is STUNNING. You've got characters from series like Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Pokemon, etc (And this should already appeal to fans everywhere), and now there are even MORE additions! Wouldn't you believe that Nintendo actually managed to bring SONIC and Metal Gear's SNAKE into the action! HOLY SHOOT! Can you imagine Mario and Sonic fighting evil side by side? Or maybe you can make them fight each other as if it is the Sega Vs Nintendo era all over again? The possibilities are endless!Speaking of endless possibilities, there's a freaking Stage Builder! This means you get to make your very own fighting arenas! Granted, there's limited things to put in, but just the privilege of being able to make levels can really keep you hyped! Look on the bright side: If you don't like the gimmicky fights in Brawl's own stages, you can just make your own.The stages themselves are extremely detailed and very creative! The gimmicks in each level help add to the intense fighting action. For example, in WarioWare Inc., (Which itself is a stage based off a minigame series, and it's very faithful. That alone deserves some praise) the players can actually compete in the minigames while fighting to earn prizes like temporary invincibility (Starman), or grow bigger!The Event Match mode from Melee has returned here, but this time, there are also events in which you and a friend could play together! Classic mode and All-Star mode also return, and of course, while they haven't truly changed, they certainly seem much better here, considering the amazing selections of characters and stages.Here's a cute bonus: Nintendo actually threw in demos of classic video games into Brawl! In the Masterpieces section, you can find trials of games such as Kirby's Adventure, Super Mario World, Ice Climber, F-Zero, Star Fox 64, etc.But that bonus is terribly pathetic compared to the game's Adventure mode! Aka the Subspace Emissary, this may as well have been sold off as its own game, but NO! Nintendo put this in as a BONUS! Think a game in which characters from several Nintendo franchises have come together and join forces to stop an evil demon-like creature that's messing with their world. THIS is that game! Sure, you are forced to play as certain characters at first (Like Mario or Pit from Kid Icarus), but eventually, you'll be loaded with almost all of the available characters in the game that you can choose from. There are also some amazing encounters with familiar good/bad guys as they are also involved with this epic plot (There is a part in which Fox and Diddy Kong fight the Pokemon, Rayquaza!). The Great Maze (Which is at the near-end of the game) left me grumbling, as it was very confusing to get past, but overall, I'm loving this!In case if you thought all of this was enough, think again; there's also online play. You can play online multiplayer against other people! Whether it's a 2 on 2 team match or every player for him/herself, I bet you'd have a very fun time playing! The only problem, though, is that the game sorta lags depending on how far away the players are from where you live. Also, the controls are slightly delayed, but fortunately, you can easily get used to it.There are other modes that I haven't really talked about for this review (Like Breaking Targets, Home-Run Contest, and Multi-Man Melee in which you fight a big number of easy-to-defeat polygonal characters), but this is already such a huge package that I'm sure you don't even need me to discuss them!Overall, there's a lot to love here for Nintendo fans. Heck, even if you AREN'T a Nintendo fan, I bet this game would get you interested! Plus, even if some game modes weren't really too great for you, there's still so much content that you'd enjoy otherwise that you might never get bored from this game! No Wii owner's library is complete without this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

I was feeling nostalgic of how many fun hours I had spent playing that game back in the day and hoping to re-live some of those feelings again! To my disappointment, the game felt foreign to me and handled very differently than what I am now accustomed to. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were definitely up-to-date. I guess the main problem was, being spoiled with Halo 3. You expected the game to handle, feel, and flow in that manner, which Anniversary does not deliver. The co-op was a very nice edition as well as the extra goodies, but even then... that seemed to fall short. Getting \"stuck\" on walls was annoying to say the least when fighting. Your shields seemed non-existing while the covenant were sporting over shields. I felt like it was not challenging as much as it was annoying! I was playing co-op with my brother, he being the bigger Halo fan, but were bored after a few hours of playing. My last complaint was the price. At forty dollars, I could not see the justification for shelling out that much cash. The only thing I felt was worth while was the DLC for Halo reach. If in doubt, rent it first and try it out for a few hours. If it holds your interest, then purchase it (since it has gone down in price) and you will see for yourself if it really re-kindles your memories of first playing this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00AXI9WFS","description":"","reviewerName":"Xina143","summary":"A Mom's Review","reviewText":"I'll start right off the bat saying that I'm NOT a gamer.  I asked my boys how much fun this game was, and they give it a five!  So, I'll touch on a few things that parents buying this for their kids might want to know.-Cost - the price seems to be on par with other games of this ilk.  Skylanders was five dollars cheaper (although we just pro-ordered the Dark Edition Skylanders Swapforce pack from GameStop and that is $100) In the starter pack you get the game, 3 figures (Mr. Incredible, Jack Sparrow, and Sulley), the Disney Infinity Base (think Skylanders portal), a Power Disc, a Play Set piece and a Web code card.  Games are expensive when they are first released, as the mom of five boys I've resigned myself to that fact, and certain games I'm more willing to spend the money on than others. THIS is one of those games.-Characters - First thing we noticed, they are hard to get out of their plastic packaging.  They are certainly in there tightly, so I would say that parents should handle this part. And that leads me into my next (tiny) issue.  Some of the characters have tiny feet, and that is the only thing holding them on to their bases.  In fact, we purchased the villain pack and Syndrome was actually broken.  The characters seem less stable and substantial than Skylanders characters.  As for the look of them - I love the characters!  They are bright, fun and LOOK like the beloved Disney (and Pixar) characters, just as they should.-Base - Again, I'm going based off my limited knowledge, and the base is MUCH thinner than the Skylanders portal.  It certainly feels sturdy and stable though. Going strictly on aesthetics - it lights up with pretty colors! It accepts the characters, power discs and play sets.-Power Discs - They are certainly cute!  I wouldn't necessarily say they are integral to the game, though you can get power ups, change the Toy Box theme, and things like that, but this is my one true issue.  The disc we got in our Starter pack was Tangled (which changes the Toy Box terrain to look like the Tangled movie), and since we only got one disc, we decided to buy two more packs.  For five to six dollars we got two discs in each pack, but you don't know what you get. They are mystery packs. I think that's fine to start off with, but once you buy three or four packs, you run the issue of simply collecting the same ones you already have.  So, maybe you end up with 6 Finding Nemo Skydome discs, and no Bolt Strength discs.  I wish you could buy specific discs, that way you eliminate wasting time and money.  That being said, the discs are cute and very strong and sturdy feeling, we even got a little 3D Dumbo Ride one, which is certainly cool and lets you fly around the Toy Box.-Play Set Piece - This is a clear cube that will take you to the different worlds.  In the starter pack you can travel to the worlds of Monsters University, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Incredibles. There is also the central locale called a Toy Box where you can test your characters and discs and even create your own world.  From what I understand from the kids and magazines, this is a truly special part of the game (again more updates on actual play coming soon, but the kids are already building silly contraptions!).  We did buy the Lone Ranger Play Set and that did come with a Play Set piece to take you to yet another world, and we have the Cars Play Set coming.My overall impression is this is another great game for kids that, like the Skylanders games, my boys will love, so this is perfect for them.  When we picked up our game this morning, we were also able to pre-order a Toy Story pack and Jack Skellington (which I did; Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite Disney movies!) so I can see that this is something the makers are going to spend time on and create a real game experience.  The characters alone appeal to my sense of nostalgia, as I (and the kids too) love Disney, Disney World, Disney movies, etc... and seeing the characters brings a smile to my face.Speaking as a parent and NOT a gamer, this is the type of game I like my younger boys (9 and 5) to play.  With older boys in the house, Call of Duty, Halo and games like that are certainly popular, but I truly like seeing a game that appeals to kids of all ages (and yes adults too!)and is suitable for them as well.In my mind, from what I've seen, this is money well spent.  I can see many happy hours of game play from my boys.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}

This one has been recommended to me for a while but I never had access to a Gamecube or a Wii so I didn't get the chance to play it until now. But boy am I glad I did. Sure, the graphics can't compare to modern RPGs, the story is cheesy, and the gameplay is turn-based and gets wearing after a while, but it still manages to be loads of fun. Why? Because it has something that most modern RPGs lack: a sense of scale. The epic fantasy adventure has gone out of style somewhat. Sure there are great games likeSkyrim, but as epic as that game is you never leave the north and have to go everywhere by horse. Even though there is far more actual scenery to visit in that game it just doesn't feel as big as one that has you flying around the entire world in your airship. And while that world may be in danger of having bad things happen to it they're never as blunt and obvious about it as in an old-school RPG. Also, the open world sandbox system that they have prevents the sense of urgency that comes from a linear storyline. This isn't to disparage modern RPGs (Skyrim is one of my faves) but to point out what old RPGs did better so as to be able to compare it properly. This game can't hold up to modern games on graphics or complexity but it makes up for it by being slightly campy, good-natured fun.The basic plot of the game is pretty simple. The entire world consists of floating islands and the people fly through the skies in flying sailships. The main character is a young pirate (but he's a Blue Rogue so that's ok) called Vyse, and he is blissfully free from the emo cliches overrunning the genre. He is good-natured, needlessly heroic, and somewhat cheeky. In short he's a pleasure to play as. There are other memorable characters but I'll leave you to discover them for yourselves. The character designs take full advantage of the cartoonish graphical limitations imposed by the Gamecube. They look like Anime characters and have a series of set expressions that can display a surprising amount of emotion. Their planet is in the process of being taken over by the Valuan empire (think the British empire with Spanish names) and Vyse makes it his mission to stop them from raising the gigas (giant monsters from ancient times). There are a few complications but the plot never gets that confusing. The villains are decent if not exceptional. The main one in particular would be much better if not for his highly generic name (Ramirez).The best thing about this game is the ship battles. That's right,you get your own ship! When you run into an enemy ship (which happens depressingly rarely except for boss fights) you go into ship battle mode. This is a turn-based system where you plan your attacks based on what the enemy is going to do. It is surprisingly fun and easily the best part of the game. The regular combat system is basically the same one from every old RPG (think Final Fantasy). It doesn't really have any quirks except that the random battles are far too frequent given that you're on a ship sailing through wide open skies. Aside from the obvious attraction of flying your own ship and the beautiful music it's quite hard to say why I'd recommend this game above others in the same genre. It's hard to define what makes a game so great. There is just a sense of fun at the proceedings that makes it a joy to play. Try it out if you get a chance. I'm glad I did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2012"}

Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"short fun games","reviewText":"I'm surprised such a large amount of people dislike this game.  The games are SUPPOSED to be simple and take advantage of the way you use the Wii Remote, and that's *exactly* what the majority of the games on the disc do.  Not only that, but you're given an option to play up to 10 games, each of them VERY different from the next.My favorite game is probably pool (billiards) because I grew up playing pool in a room we called the \"pool room\" on the second floor of my house (now a spare bedroom) and I simply had the time of my life with it.  Playing pool in video game form is a bit odd because of the way you're required to line up a target on the cue ball in order to shoot.  It's still quite fun though.  It just takes time to learn the controls.Another great game is the fishing one, where your fishing pole has to be in the water and the object is to catch as many fish as you can in a certain amount of time.  While it CAN be frustrating learning to keep the fishing pole in the water, it can be figured out with practice.  Just don't jerk the Wii Remote around and you'll be fine.Laser hockey rules.  Again, don't jerk the Wii Remote around, or you'll jerk the controls too hard and end up missing some fairly easy shots, and the computer will take advantage of that and win the games.  I find that sitting about 10 feet away from the TV screen with my arm extended helps prevent me from getting the urge to jerk the Wii Remote too far up, down, left or right.The shooting games (which are actually target-shooting games) are REALLY good.  You have to shoot balloons, targets, cans, spaceships, ducks, clay pigeons, and other things to collect points.  It's very similar to the classic Duck Hunt game.  I remember Duck Hunt really well!  First game I ever had.Now for the bad- there's a game where you have to match two look-alike Mii's, and find the odd person out of a group of many.  Only problem is, I can't figure out what the \"odd person\" is supposed to mean after playing the game 20 times.Also, there's another game where you have to move these miniature army tanks around and shoot down your opponent, and this game is EXTREMELY hard because moving the target into an accurate aiming position is almost impossible.  This is the only example in the entire game where the target moves around WAY too quickly and it's really a huge pain to figure out.Overall, great game, but not perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002MED6EO","description":"Midnight Club: Hits PS3","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Decent Racer","reviewText":"Okay, I'll admit before writing my review, that I am a little biased...I am overall not that big into racing games.  I am really more into shooters and action/adventure type games, but I do dabble in racing games a little bit from time to time.  I purchased this game for 2 reasons:1st reason...I am a collector of most Rockstar titles, and they're known to put out some pretty good games, and this basically completes my Ps3 Rockstar collection up to date...I've got the complete editions of Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV, and LA Noir as well.2nd reason...I was looking for a decent racer just to have on hand to dink around on whenever I had the urge to race, and with the Rockstar label on this one and the good reviews I read on it, I decided to go ahead and scoop this one up.I'll have to say that it was a little different than I was expecting, but overall it's fairly fun.  I was expecting the graphics to be a little better than they were, and they were at times a little choppy.  Plus, I usually enjoy a bit more relaxed and unpressured gameplay, (yes, I know...on races there is always pressure), but I felt that I was kinda being rushed in this game as far as taking races.  I kinda wanted to drive around and explore some of the city, but messages and calls about races just keep popping up, and I feel rushed to go out and do all these races.  They also really don't give you much of a tutorial, so I was sitting there trying to figure out all the buttons on my own.  It took me a minute before I finally realized that the right analog stick propells you forward and backwards.  It was a little getting use to, but once I kind of adapted to it, it wasn't so bad.  Mind you, these are all minor things, but slight annoyances to me none the less.That all being said though, I have rather enjoyed tinkering around on this game from time to time, taking races & earning money, and upgrading my car & whatnot.  I have not begun to get around to where I can start making a lot of money and buying new cars, but I'm sure I'll get there eventually.  Plus, I have a friend in Texas who has this game as well and we're going to start playing online a little.  All in all, this is a decently fun little racer, and if you're into racing games and haven't ever tried it, I would say go ahead and give it a shot and see what you think.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2012"}

I know its Cods thing but it just encourages the camp it up ethic that seemingly is here to stay .Treyarch for me have always done a good story & this sounds great but as i have said to friends the seems to be a lack of single player focus on games these days & replays through the campaign are redundant as it stands leaving the inflated price tag of this franchise for me means its a rent at best. I still have yet to see any real innovation from a Cod dev & until that happens my thought processes will remain unchanged .This game was going to be my replacement for BFBC2 but the missing 4player co-op story & the return of the fun for 20 mins zombies has left me saving 45 & using it to shore up BFBC2's GOTY potential with the Vietnam pack & the pre-ordering of PoP HD giving me proper fun online with no pats on the back for camping & many hours of single player old school fun .Great read though & it seems like i am in a huge minority of opinion but this title & franchise is clearly the leader in the Fps market.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

While during multiplayer, it'll lag out or just stop the game completely and reload it while you are stuck frozen until game play resumes which, you could be face to face with the opponent thus getting killed soon as the 5 second countdown is over.... which that has happened to many times to me.  No it is not internet problems I have, my internet is always at full service.Anyhow, the game is fun. You have to buy your weapons and camo for your weapons and attachments, makes it easier to get rather than trying to kill with a weapon like MoD 2 for an attachment if you are bad at the game, it is more competitive as well.

{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Vanillaware lives up to its name...","reviewText":"I was cautiously optimistic for \"Dragon's Crown,\" a recent Japanamaniac orgasmatron. Although I absolutely despised \"Odin Sphere\" (one of the most overrated, overhyped pieces of crap I've ever had the displeasure of playing), this game supposedly hearkened back to the arcade 80s and 90s, to the days of Final Fight, Double Dragon and Streets of Rage. Of course, I poured tons of quarters into those machines in the day, so I was eager to take up the mantle again, complete with enhanced graphics and \"RPG-style elements\" (which, again, is a phrase that usually puts me on guard).All in all, Dragon's Crown isn't a bad game. It just isn't a good one, either. Obviously the graphics garner praise, and like Odin Sphere, they are beautiful to look at. The RPG elements (which basically boils down to the ability to level skills in order to play to your strengths) are perfunctory, but hardly amaze. It might be the case that the skills allow for a lot of different playstyles, but I found myself generally leveling the same ones over and over - stuff to regain hit points from coins, stuff to increase score, and stuff that allowed me to press buttons like crazy. I like mashing buttons, even more so in games like this, and I deplore well-crafted strategies in otherwise-frantic multiplayer bash-fests. Thankfully, there were skills that satisfied this craving, and while they hamstrung me a bit on higher difficulties, I had saved enough SP to alter my playstyle for the two bosses for which button mashing didn't work (the dragon on Infernal difficulty, and the Demon Lord).The gameplay is standard side-scrolling beat-em-up nonsense, but here is where the problems begin. A lot of reviews have praised this game as a return to 16-bit glory, but this is a dirty lie. You see, when you play a game like Streets of Rage 2, there is always the fear that you're going to die. After all, there needs to be something to get you to plug those quarters into the machine. There is cheapness galore. Here? The game is blindingly simple. In fact, it was so simple that I didn't even realize there were lives until I made it to the final boss of the game, where I lost them all. That is, for 18 stages (with no real grinding beyond completing pointless side quests), I never lost a single life. It is possible that my allies died, but I never noticed it. Thus, it was a huge surprise to me to find that I actually had three lives (and could increase that number to 4 with a little dough). Enemies fall incredibly easily. In fact, nothing will stand in your path as you carve your way to the end. How in the world this conjures memories of side-scrollers of the past is unknown to me.Another problem with the game is that it is incredibly short. There are a total of 19 stages, and each stage consists of around 5-6 screens. There are few enemies (even including palette swaps). This is a place that an homage to side-scrollers of the past should improve dramatically. Add to this the fact that, although there are six characters, they have exactly the same quests, in exactly the same order, and you really get the feeling that vanillaware just mailed it in. It's hard to motivate yourself to beat this game 6 different times, simply to see one different ending screen. Even the narration is the same! Would it have killed the developers to create different questlines, a la Dynasty Warriors? Or, at the VERY least, to give different subquests to different characters?Multiplayer is OK, but I often find there's too much going on. It can become very easy to lose your character in the shuffle. The bonuses for beating the game are slight. There is a coliseum mode, but it's a complete joke, and most people will ignore it after getting the (easy) trophy. There are two additional difficulties, but this just means you'll have to grind. It's particularly annoying that the level cap for normal is 35, but the level of enemies in the first hard dungeon is 42. The jump is also present when going to \"infernal\" difficulty (though not as severe). Strangely, if you beat the game, and then change back to normal difficulty, you will level as normal. Supposedly, your stats are stunted, but you still keep the benefits of any skills you have leveled. This makes completing side quests particularly easy, as you can just play them all on normal mode (and you'll get the same amount of experience). Lazy, lazy, lazy.Speaking of lazy, there is a town in the game which serves as the hub of your travels. Apparently, it is populated by three people - a man, a boy, and a woman with a very bouncing bosom. You will see these same three people, at the same places in the town, for the entirety of all your quests. You can't talk to them, but you can hurt them and get arrested. This serves no purpose other than unlocking another trophy. There are also some shopkeepers. The graphics here are pathetic. You get a single, flat image of a character staring at you, The characters change expression discretely - there is no continuous motion here.One interesting note: this game seemed to try to sell itself on the caricatured representation of its 6 classes. For example, the sorceress has a giant set of milk glands. The amazon has huge thighs and derriere. It might have been humorous to see such nonsensical proportions in the males as well (maybe the Dwarf could have used his wang as a pogo stick). However, unlike the videos, which were zoomed on the characters, the game itself is more environmental, so while you'll notice the proportions, you'll quickly dismiss them, because the characters are actually quite small compared to the world around them. My guess is that Vanillaware took a page out of Suda 51's book - manufacture controversy on the objectification of women.With all of that being said, I return to my first statement. This isn't a bad game, but it's not a good one either. If you like very repetitive, mostly easy slashing, you'll be fine here (although all but the most hardcore fan will probably be bored after completing a single characters quest). If not, stay away - you'll find this mindless very quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}
