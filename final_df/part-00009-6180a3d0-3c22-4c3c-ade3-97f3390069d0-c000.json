How many times in other games have you been able to quickly spot an item you can interact with because it doesn't blend in with the scenery? Not in Ico, the environment all looks consistent. How many games plaster icons, bars and scores in a head-up display over the scenery? Not in Ico, and I'm glad because the scenery is breath-takingly beautiful and having no clutter makes the game more film-like. How many games have basic puzzles you've seen before or can work out in 5 seconds flat? Not Ico, the vast majority of the puzzles are original, and a delight to discover. And how many games make you genuinely care for the characters, and make you feel like you're there? Ico does.The puzzles are hard, but not illogical. They're also very original and SO satisfying to solve. The level design is true genius.The central game mechanic revolves around you controlling Ico, helping to guide a strange young girl called Yorda as you try and escape the castle. Leave Yorda on her own ad she'll get attacked. Sometimes she even helps you solve puzzles by pointing to places you should direct your attention.Like the best games, Ico draws you in with its fantastic atmosphere. The graphics and sound are both absolutely top-notch. The haunted castle feels and sounds dark and lonely. High up on the parapets, it's cold and scary as the wind blasts you.If you don't already own Ico - buy it! It's easily one of the best PS2 games to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}

But this game just doesn't deliver.The graphics and control are fine.  I thought the graphics were great, actually.  And the voice-acting was well-done, too.It's the gameplay that's really, really weak.  When attacking bad guys, you don't do much.  You hit \"A\" repeatedly, maybe X or Y for a special move.  But there's no skill or timing involved.  You can get knocked out or die or something - but once the current fight is over, your guy wakes up with no real issues.  Maybe they have some kinda injury (cracked skull, broken arm) but once the sequence / level is over, your guy is healed, no problem.  When your guy dies, you automatically take control over someone else in your party.  But you can't like use someone else's potion to cure your main guy, or trade armor/weapons.The interaction between characters is dull.  I use Y to skip conversations all the time.  You make comments or ask questions, but you don't hear your guys speak.  It's just a multiple-choice of responses, and so far I see no pros or cons depending on what you choose to reply to someone.  The game just plods on.The menu system is confusing.  There's no common sense to any of it and it's easily the ugliest thing about the game.  I don't know how to assign moves to buttons or whatever.  It's just not well thought out.-Overall, it's just boring.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"ribcage","summary":"love it or hate it","reviewText":"The biggest gripe with this game seems to be combat. Of course. They've put out something pretty innovative and people aren't used to it. I think it's great. Basically, when you run into an enemy, your game pauses for you to select a string of moves for enabling defensive measures and/or general combat. Then you press the white button to start the action. You continue to qeue up your moves or, if you desperately need something to happen at that time, you can press A for the current string to be erased and the action pressed will happen immediately. It's a little weird at first, but it's really pretty easy to catch on to if you've got any intelligence.There's plenty of weapons, lightsabers with ability affecting crystals, and awesome force powers.The story is incredible and very involving. You get to visit 7 planets, including Kashyyk and Tatooine. The areas on the planets can seem somewhat limiting, but I didn't really notice it all that much, usually being preocuppied with one quest or another.You collect 9 members for your group as you progress, though only two at at time can go with you when you leave your ship. I guess having 9 is cool, but I tend to only find 3 of them indispensable. I occasionally switch things up, but only to either see what inter-character chat springs up, or to activate a character-specific side-quest. Of course, the game occasionally tells you that you have to or can't have someone in your party, but that's just for quests driving the story. It happens only a few times.As for the \"CHOOSING YOUR PATH\" part: it rocks. Haha. Really. I played through the game on the light side. There's a big surprise near the end of the game and that blew me away. Then I beat the game and immediately started over, this time playing on the dark side. I was blown away by some of the cool things that cropped up, such as force-choking a guy who disrepects you. You don't kill him, but every time you run into him after that he's too afraid to talk to you. Sort of like everyone running in terror from you in Fable, only not quite as irritating. And things changed radically near the end, and that blew me away. Of course, the ending itself is different, but I was prepared for that.So overall, it's pretty cool. Rent it first, I'd say, just to see if you can cope with the combat system.I'd love to say more about the stuff that made me really love the game, but I don't want to put down any SPOILERS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2005"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

I mean they wanted us to pay 150 for the 32X, 300 for the sega cd, and the gensis.(100-in 95) So you spent 550+ and now a year latter they are telling you need to buy a new system for 300.

It's getting to the point where we should expect issues on day one for any launch. I'm a developer myself so I know that no amount of beta testing can conceivably simulate what it will be like when an application goes live. Stuff happens, things get fixed, performance bottlenecks are resolved and you move on.At first I was a little underwhelmed by the game. There did not seem to be too much of an improvement over the previous version and with 10 years in the making I was expecting to be blown away. But as I spent more time with the game, I starting to get that same can't-stop-playing feeling we all know and love about great games. There just something really awesome about the game-play that kept me coming back for more and the graphics are enough of an improvement that it feels new - not cutting edge but good enough.There's been a lot of complaints about this game needing a constant internet connection even when playing as a single player game. I'm not as critical and I'm willing to give Blizzard the benefit of the doubt with this. For one, we can expect this service to keep our files up to date with patches and potential improvements. Also to maintain any level of security and fair play with the new auction house feature having a managed service is a must. Blizzard is trying to innovate with the auction house concept in a way that extends the scope of the game while also providing a new source of revenue. It is unlikely I will make use of the real currency auction house but I can see how that could appeal to a dedicated fan base.As a busy person, this game provides me quick bursts of gaming without having to dedicate several continuous hours to get any sense of accomplishment. The ability to get into some action quickly and start gathering loot is very satisfying. I can see myself playing this game for the next ten years - hopefully we won't have to wait as long for an expansion or a new version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

Batman AA bucks the trend of poor comic book based games and delivers a fantastic gaming experience.The storyline is dark and complex and involves the Joker taking control of Arkham Asylum located on an island close to Gotham City. I refrain from giving away plot spoilers but I'll just say that the story in Arkham Asylum is excellent. It's developed with some of the best voice-acting I've heard from any video game, period. Many of the voices are dubbed by the same cast responsible for the animated Batman series, including Mark Hamil as the Joker. Along the journey Batman will encounter and face many of his most devious foes including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Bane, Killer Croc, Zsasz, and more. Each character is expertly narrated and I honestly felt that Arkham Asylum the game is better than many of the Batman movies.Graphics are also top-notch. Each character is rendered beautifully and moves in a realistic way. Arkham Asylum is simultaneously dark & gritty, though beautiful in it's own right. A standout moment in the game takes place when when Batman emerges from a cave and surveys the entirety of Arkham Island with Gotham City gleaming in the background. It's one of those supremely memorable gaming moments when you realize a game is so good and you can't wait to continue adventuring though you can't help but pause and take in the scenery.The main adventure took me around 10 hours to beat on the 'Normal' difficulty setting. Though there are plenty of extras to keep the adventure going longer. Spread throughout Arkham Asylum are riddles and challenges that were put in place by The Riddler. It's up to the gamer solve the riddles which vary from finding a solution to an actual riddle or finding a hidden 'Riddler Trophy'. More unique challenges await too, such as finding The Riddler's tell-tale calling sign - the \"?\" - these challenges require finding and aligning the different parts of the question marks spread throughout Arkham. All told there are 240 Riddler Challenges. Additionally the game is packed with Easter Eggs that give more insight into the cast of characters in the game and on Arkham. Finding patient interview tapes for example will give brief snippets of recorded conversations between Batman's foes and their doctors at Arkham Asylum. The player is also rewarded for solving the Riddler's Challenges with Predator & Combat Challenges along with highly detailed player trophies (think virtual action figures) and character profiles. All told there is tons of content to keep players busy long after the story has been completed.I've seen a few reviews that knock Batman AA for not having an online mode. Personally I don't think having online game play is at all a necessity. A game like Arkham Asylum is really meant to be an engrossing, story-driven experience for a single player. However, for those concerned about replay value I can understand that online game play is a way to keep the experience going. Still Eidos & Rocksteady Studios have done a marvelous job keeping the replay value high. The Challenge Rooms is the primary method they have done so. Challenge Rooms come in two varieties as I mentioned before, Predator and Combat. In Predator Challenges the gamer is tasked with defeating a set group of enemies. In each room the player is given three unique ways in which an enemy must be taken down. Some are simple and others not simple at all. But the challenge is great fun. Combat Challenge Rooms are more straightforward - defeat a set amount of enemies over four rounds in each room. The goal is to acquire as many points as possible by chaining combat moves. Each round is tallied at the end and a rating is issued. Furthermore, on the PS3, the developer has included the Joker as a playable character in specific Joker Challenge Rooms. All told there is plenty of content to keep you busy.For a game that seemingly came out of nowhere and has surprised almost everyone with it's quality, it comes at no surprise then that Arkhan Asylum is being thrown around as a potential \"Game of the Year\". Well, ultimately that's to everyone's individual taste, but Batman Arkham Asylum is certainly one of the best games I've played all year! Highly recommended that you stop reading and buy this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}

In case some of you guys didn't know, Street Fighter II was the first fighting game to ever revolutionize the fighting game genre. It was so big, that it created a huge audience of fans and on top of that, Capcom was making big bucks when this game released ! Plus, some SFII merchandise was made, but most of them were cheesy during those times. The action figures, which was originally made by the guys who gave you GI Joe figures, really looked corny, but the figures that were made in Japan looked perfectly articulated and well crafted (you can see them in some stores where they sell comic books and Japanese anime merchandise). Plus in 1994, they made a horrible live action Street Fighter movie based on it, and boy, it was a mistake to make the movie in the first place ! The SFII anime movie was even better, according to real fans of the series. Anyways, let me drop the subject ! I'm about to give you the lowdown on the game (man I love saying that !). The graphics look great for an SNES game. Nicely animated character sprites and backgrounds are really something to look at, including those fireballs shooting straight ! But due to todays standards, they seem a little bit outdated and they don't seem to surpass the animation of SFII Turbo. The audio is fine. The music for each character stage sounds cool and they're so unforgetable, it always sticks to some people's heads. And the sounds of heavy and light hitting sound pretty cool, but the grunts and yells sound a little weird, but it fits perfectly. The line of characters, well in that year, it was fine by us. But unfortunately, just by looking at it today, 7 fighters is not really enough, but at least these characters are kick serious arse ! You got Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Zangief, Dhalsim, and Blanka ! Each of them are very simple to master once you've played the game a few times. And as for the gameplay, it's a kind of a good blend, but some flaws are seen. You get a fairly good deal of game modes, but the controls seem to be a little slow. Even with that flaw, it totally makes it up for the slow playability with a good variety of moves to pull out ! And it has a fairly good gameplay balance due to that kind of variety. But even with those flaws and the fact that it's not really the best Street Fighter game of all time, Street Fighter II had what it takes to become one of the most unforgetable and revolutionary 2D fighting games of all time ! If you're going to buy an old SNES along with some good ol-school games like Contra 3, Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss, Mario Kart, Breath of Fire II, and all those hits, don't forget Street Fighter II ! Your collection isn't complete without any game bearing the SFII name...even if you got Mortal Kombat !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2002"}

You still get all the classic gadgets including missile launcher, morph ball, bombs, double-jump, etc. What's typical is that each gadget comes in to play throughout the game. The enemies in this game (and throught the prime triliogy) are space pirates.What I love about the prime series is trying to find all the upgrades. I like that it doesn't use trophies or achievements yet I wanted to get everything.

Gordon","summary":"The hype was deserved this time","reviewText":"Putting aside from the typical reactions one gets from those who are predisposed to dislike this game due to its controversy (such as so-called \"attorney\" Jack Thompson, whose crusade against this and other violent video games has become an unintentional self-parody), it seems that there are those who are quite vocal about disliking this game due to the ridiculous amounts of hype the series receives.  I can't completely blame them; after all, certain magazines (such as Game Informer) seem to throw any semblance of journalistic integrity out the window in their quest to write slavishly glowing and obsequious previews and reviews of any games from GTA's developers, Rockstar Games.  These publications make it seem that there are no other worthwhile games out there aside from the GTA games, to such a degree that it almost screams payola.  Or does it?By this point, you probably are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto premise, established by Grand Theft Auto 3 in 2001.  You control a criminally inclined character in a city, who can take a variety of missions from characters scattered about the area, and can pretty much take over most any vehicle.  While there is a storyline in the game, you are allowed a significant amount of freedom, to the point where you can choose to not take any story missions, and instead either take on minor side missions, or simply drive about and cause chaos.  GTA 3's sequel, Vice City, was the beneficiary of relentless media hype arising from the swell of unexpected success from its predecessor.  While it boasted a number of improvements, such as better graphics, a great licensed soundtrack, a more cinematic storyline (complete with celebrity voice acting), somewhat better targeting, and the addition of motorcycles and helicopters, Vice City was really not the quantum leap in gaming it was billed as.  Not only did it fail to correct some of the failings of GTA 3, but it also took a step backwards in environmental design, as Vice City's flashy '80s neon cool couldn't make up for its flat and boring design (as opposed to Liberty City's multi-tiered, busy design).When the hype over the next Grand Theft Auto game began to build, my reaction was more of a \"so what\"?  Sure, I loved the GTA Double Pack (and had originally played a fair portion of Vice City on the PS2), but did I really need another stint in a small city, pursuing the same kind of missions and mayhem as before?  However, when I found out the true scope of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, my interest grew exponentially.GTA: San Andreas is certainly one of the most ambitious action games I've ever seen.  Instead of providing one mere city, this game provides an entire state, albeit a relatively small and abridged one (when compared to the real thing).  Three very distinct cities (based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas), a dozen small towns, a mountain, desert, woods, prairie, farms, rivers- this game's environment is the definition of \"throwing in the kitchen sink\".  The number of missions has increased from the prior installments' 60-odd missions to over 100 story/side-story missions, plus the \"career\" missions (vigilante, ambulance, firefighter, valet, trucker, pimp, burglar, etc.), and the inevitable racing challenges.  If that's not enough, several \"just for kicks\" mini-games are included, such as pool, basketball free-throws, and arcade games.  But wait- there's more!  The variety of vehicles has once again increased, and now includes a selection of \"proper\" airplanes (including a fighter jet!), ATVs, and mountain bikes, in addition to cars, boats, motorcycles, and helicopters.Beyond these changes, the gameplay mechanics have been kicked up a notch.  Your character, Carl Johnson, can now not only swim, but can also climb over fences if needed.  In a move unheralded in the series, the developers threw in RPG elements: the more you perform an action (running, firing a certain weapon, driving), the higher your related skill stats go.  You can customize your character to a certain degree (haircuts, individual clothing items), affect your characters physique by eating and working out, and even have a few girlfriends (who you can go on dates with).  Targeting has also been improved, with the addition of a new manual aim mechanic for all projectile weapons, and a fully controllable camera.  At several points in the game, you'll also get to lead your own posse of gang members, and engage in territorial conflict.The storyline this time around is a little less tongue in cheek, and a little bit more serious.  You control Carl Johnson, a former gang member, who is dragged back into the lifestyle by an unexpected death in the family.  Even if you were never into the \"Boyz In The Hood\" genre of melodrama, the game is so well executed, and expands so far beyond that conceit, that it's hard not to be drawn in.  (The downside is that this game may hit too close to home for anyone in a neighborhood terrorized by gang violence and the resulting \"collateral damage\".)  The true breadth of the game really hits you when you first drive beyond the Los Santos city limits, into the countryside of Red County.  Not only is there variety to be found in the three general country areas bordering the cities, but each of the three big cities is distinct from the others.  Los Santos (the Los Angeles clone) combines the sun-drenched, beachcomber vibe of Vice City with the gritty sprawl of the L.A. seen in Quentin Tarentino and John Singleton movies, and the elevated highway interchanges and lofty downtown metropolitan look of more decadent depictions of the West Coast.  San Fierro's (the fake San Francisco) vertical inclines and polished architecture come off as a more genteel, pleasant version of Liberty City.  While the Las Vegas-inspired Las Venturas sports the weakest layout of the cities, being too reminiscent of Vice City's flat, low-rise tract design, its neon-lit casinos, scattered industrial depots and encircling highway system provide their own charms.For the Xbox version, there's the good...and the bad.  One of the greatest improvements is the inclusion of custom soundtracks.  As huge as the included soundtrack is, I feel that Vice City's '80s soundtrack is better, and I'm not much of a fan of rap or grunge (I do sort of like the New Jack Swing station).  The ability to make my own soundtrack is key for a game which depends a lot on cruising around; King Crimson, Deep Purple, Angra, The Four Tops, and more make the experience more unpredictable and just more fun.  The graphics are improved in that the draw distance is better, textures are a bit nicer, and the almost-overwhelming orange glow present in the PS2 version has been toned down.  However, the cool car reflections of the PS2 version are MIA, for some reason.  In general, the graphics are not as shiny and \"clean\" as the Xbox version of Vice City, but do seem to provide more detail and variety (even if in a somewhat grainier fashion). Controls are a similar mixed bag; while the Xbox control sticks are a sight better for targeting, the controls for \"drive-by shooting\" are abysmal, compared to the GTA Double Pack (why the change?).This game is so huge in scope that you'll find yourself playing for 70 or more hours, whether engaged in the more elaborate missions (which involve such diverse objectives as chasing a train, framing a DA, infiltrating a military base, a high speed mid-air dog fight, and even an assassination in far away Liberty City!), betting on the horse races, or in just exploring the huge environment.  It's true that the \"open world\" genre is no longer new and enough in itself, with competition from Saint's Row, Just Cause, and True Crime: NYC.  However, while those games may have better graphics, or a more refined targeting system, none of them has the depth of gameplay, variety and attention to environmental design as this game.  For once, the hype was right.  They finally made a game that feels almost as immersive as an actual world, but without as many limitations.  (Note to the parents reading this: DO NOT get this game for any kid under 16.  It's very entertaining, but the subject matter and context of the violence [of which there is plenty] is better for a \"less impressionable\" mind.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2007"}

Also the controls have pretty much stayed the same so no worries about having to learn new button combos and the like, you'll have the square for melee attacks, triangle for counters, and circle for grabs pretty much the way it was with the first and second game.  The game starts off fast paced as well giving us a standard Sully/Drake confrontation that will introduce us to the main villainess as well as give us some background on the story between Sully and Drake during their early years which is a big plus for us Uncharted fans as we can now see the history between are two beloved treasure hunters.  The audio is spectacular giving us crystal clarity as you listen around you in the levels,  and the humorous dialogue is always good for a laugh as you hear the sarcastic wit that goes between Drake and Sully or as you hear Drake throughout the levels.  The main menu gives you the option of starting the single player storyline,  go online and play multiplayer games scenarios or do a co-op also also you can't help but be amazed at how incredible the cutscenes  look in the game.  I've just started playing the game and I'm just on the early start where we see Drake as a young child so while I haven't finished the game yet I'm just so entertained and appreciative already that I wanted to give my opinion already about the game.  So for all us Uncharted fans out there lets give a shout as we have finally gotten our holy grail at last after waiting for two years and now all I can say is let's hope the fourth Uncharted comes out soon as I definitely can't wait for the continuing journeys of our beloved characters...Update01-11-2012A little update about the bonus features in campaign mode,  while all you'll really get to see at most are the hidden treasures you find throughout the game there has been an update that now allows you to see cutscenes that happened throughout the game like with the previous two Uncharted games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0012N3ZXS","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"An exceptional fighting game","reviewText":"Prior to the release of Street Fighter IV, part of me was wondering why I even wanted to buy this. I haven't really played a fighter in years and I only got the HD Remix version of II just to psych myself up for this release and yet this game was on my list to buy for games in February. Maybe it's the name, the calibre and quality Capcom is known for but maybe I want to go back to 1992 and 1993 when it was fun just to fight people and friends. There's a couple of balance issues here and there and the new fighters aren't as memorable as previous new ones like Cammy or Fei Long but it's still a fun fighter with enough accessibility for new players and yet room for the hardcore.Story: Not really much of a story here but basically after II, the supposed fall of M. Bison and Shadaloo has actually brought about a new threat, that of S.I.N, the weapons section of Shadaloo. Each character will have an anime video at the beginning and end of their arcade playthrough but they're a little brief, not really substantial but they're at least cooler than text ones or bizarre ones (Dead or Alive 4 anyone?)Graphics: When HD Remix was released, character models got an upgrade that looked more anime-influenced than anything but IV takes it in a different direction with a more striking and colorful art style and frankly it's gorgeous. Even the background levels look stunning such as being on a boat in front of a sun setting by the bay to a tranquil-looking jungle and a busy marketplace. Character models and animations are also quite well done with small details like Blanka's eyes popping out when you nail the final blow or the second try Dan has to do before he finally throws someone. Installing to hard drive is a must since load times are barely found and replicates an arcade experience even more.Sound/Music: Included with the collector's edition of the game is the soundtrack and it's actually really awesome. From techno to big epicness, the music in the game is really great. While others praise 3rd Strike's soundtrack more (which I haven't heard), the tunes in this one is cool...except Fei Long whose theme literally has his yell voice clips mixed in. As for voice acting I always kept it at Japanese and I prefer it that way and of course nobody can complain about Japanese voice acting. Even cute little catgirls with high voices are better in Japanese so there's no complaints here.Gameplay: Anyone who knows how to hadouken and lightning kick will easily get the hang of it but there's some other gameplay elements to give it a bit more kick. EX moves where you perform a bit more damaging version of a move is here and if you get hit enough, your revenge meter will fill which'll let you unleash a powerful Ultra combo complete with more cinematic camera angles rather than just 2D. They're slightly difficult to pull off and some characters like Guile or Vega have ultras that I still haven't been able to say even in practice mode with the meters at infinite. Going through the training and challenges will let you become more capable over time but be warned: some of the people online are either cheap move fighters or really good so I'd either fight computer for a good while or at least train in player matches.The character roster is quite good though there's some inclusions and some absent. Added are Abel, Crimson Viper, Rufus and El Fuerte. Abel's probably the easiest to get into while the rest are a little practice-makes-perfect kinds where you really got to know the ins and outs of the character to use them effectively and not spam fireballs or just turtle and flash kick everyone. Included in the roster are Sakura, Dan, Cammy, Akuma, Gouken and Fei Long as well as favorites such as Ryu, Chun Li, Vega and Guile. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses and you'll probably use some more than others unless you really know how to fully use one character.One thing that is always found in fighters are exploits or cheap moves. For example, a move that knocks you off your feet the minute you get up or people who jump in and sweep, back away, jump and sweep but most AI characters aren't like this, that is until you get to Seth. Keep in mind I don't play most fighters so I can't say if there's anyone worse but this guy is probably one of the most infuriating characters not because he's fast, better and more agile but because he spams, cancels out moves and seems to almost know instinctively what you want to do. Charge moves can be done 3 times in a row, throws can find you anywhere and he'll even teleport into a throw and well, let's just say he's a pain. Some characters will also do that as well and never seem to let you have a chance or keep you in the corner until you're dead so be warned that some fights will make the veins in your forehead pop up...just like a fighter would do.As for the collector's edition, it comes with the free Brawler pack DLC which is alternate costumes for certain characters, the aforementioned awesome soundtrack, a comic detailing the new characters moves and combos and the anime film \"The Ties That Bind\" which is roughly an hour. I haven't watched it yet though I get the feeling it'll be either really cool but cheesy or cheesy and unintentionally hilarious. Or maybe all of it. Oh and there's a Crimson Viper figurine (rather tiny actually, there's more plastic case than the damn figurine) for the Xbox 360 version while the lucky PS3 buyers get Ryu. I don't see why 360 doesn't get Ken just for compliment's sake or even Chun Li and Crimson Viper is one of the more \"meh\" characters so I don't get why they picked that one.As for the game itself, it's awesome, I haven't experienced a lot of hiccups online and despite some of the dubious requirements for unlocking Akuma and Gouken, the roster and moves make this a must buy for fighter fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Not all imitation can be flattering","reviewText":"Part of the first quarter of the year is filled with massive games that nearly everyone's going to buy with stuff like Mass Effect 2, Bioshock 2, God of War 3 or Final Fantasy XIII to be sure fire purchases for many gamers, there's the occasional in-between title that will act as a sort-of side game to work on when you aren't busy with another game. So this week we have to highly anticipated Bioshock 2 coming out at the same time as this game, an action title developed by Visceral Games, same dev team who made Dead Space, the Simpsons game and the Godfather game. How does the title stack up? Not well considering it's sort of sandwiched between 2 games: the smooth-as-silk combat found in Bayonetta and the PS3 mammoth that is God of War 3 and playing through Dante's Inferno made me realize how much I miss Bayonetta as this game personally doesn't feel polished or the least bit fun as so many annoyances bother me. Ever play a game that gets compared to another one but you realize the original was better just because of how better it felt compared to the other one? That's what Dante's Inferno was to me; a game that is inspired in places yet a game that stumbles way more times than it should.Story: Taking inspiration from the first book, \"Inferno\" by Dante Aligheri as part of his \"Divine Comedy\" poem, you control Dante, a warrior in the Crusades who comes across his dead wife, Beatrice only to have her soul spirited away by Lucifer right to the depths of Hell. So with the help of a huge scythe taken by Death himself, Dante literallys goes through Hell in order to save his beloved. Here's where it gets interesting: the story in this game is actually well told and the cinematics are quite cool so unlike Bayonetta where the story was secondary to the combat, here it's the reverse: I kind of lamented that I had to play the game itself in order to see the story unfold. I'd rather watch someone else play this one.Graphics: Dante's Inferno is, no pun intended, cursed and blessed with the subject matter as the art team can go to town on the enemy designs and there's some stuff that makes me wonder the mental stability of the individual. I'll just say one thing: scythe for arms on a baby that crawl out of a nipple. I'll leave it at that, rest you have to discover for yourself. Clearly the game goes crazy with the designs and there's some messed up stuff. However this also means that the game gets unbelievably same-y after awhile and there's only so many shades of dark red, brown and grey that it becomes slightly monotone; hell even some enemies can fade into the background given the right kind of shade. Framerate issues are practically non-existant and like I said, the mixture of rendered cinematics and the weird animation look great but the look of the game just feels so bland.Sound/Music: What you'd expect from a game inspired by Hell: slashes, screams, belches and farts of all things and unearthly roars populate the sound mix but when there's one sound I love: when you press RT near an enemy, you have an option to Absolve (save) or Punish (condemn) and picking the absolve option, one move is where you do a \"mash B\" event where you inch your cross closer to their face but once you win the event you hit their face with such a satisfying slam effect that it might listening to the overbearing soundtrack filled with \"epic\" choir and bombastic music more tolerable. Voice acting though is quite well-done and well the occasional line is spotty, I didn't find it too be an embarassing voice acting job.Gameplay: In my review I believe for Bayonetta I mentioned that there's some combat systems you button mash and some you have to learn in order to really exceed. Well I button mash this one with the occasional block and unfortunately the combat was the first thing wrong I noticed with the game. First of all I find the controls at times to be unreliable or unresponsive as holding Block when I wanted to actually block the attack resulted in a hit anyway and just pressing A didn't result in a jump since it was like I almost had to actually press it more than once just to get him to actually do the move. In a game where timing and keeping an eye on the battlefield is crucial, I find it poor that I can't do a certain move whenever I need to and certain encounters were literally infuriating because dodging resulted in a hit anyway and enemies that do the background blend mentioned above got a hit on me before I even realized they were going to attack. One cool thing about the combat is in regards to the holy/unholy options for move purchasing with unholy favoring outright power moves while holy favors buffs such as heightened attack power or health upgrades. What this means however is you either have playthrough 1 doing unholy only which doesn't have the health upgrades and buffs of holy or vice versa or you have playthrough 1 being half and half where you don't have any of the larger upgrades of the higher tier.Dante's Inferno in terms of other features are just as poorly implemented like puzzles that are either too easy or too vague that you feel like \"how do you solve this anyway?\". There's some platforming parts that are literally timed and you have to run your ass off only to not actually know how to get through it and one part, the chains you're swinging along Uncharted-style catch on fire where you not only have to jump before the fire reaches your hand but also time your jump so it passes by the occasional flame burst. Oh and occasionally you run into a lost soul that you can either punish or absolve and these are people like Elektra or Pontius Pilate so let's say you want holy points and well you play a little mini-game where dragonballs (cause that's what they look like to me) float towards a display of the face buttons and you have to time it so that you press the button as it reaches the icon. Basically a PaRappa the Rapper-type minigame but it's incredibly flow-breaking, it's boring however getting an upgrade that automatically does it doesn't give you as much points so you're almost encourage to play it. A late-game gauntlet of challenges of the \"kill x amount of enemies or kill enemies in mid-air\" variety make it poorly placed. At least Darksiders had it to brighten up the exploration, here it feels like \"but we don't want you to beat the game yet! Hm...I know! We'll have them play little arena matches!\"Last month a game came out called Army of Two: 40th Day which was either a cool game for some but for many others it was just \"eh, I've played better\". This to me embodies this game: sure it's occasionally fun and I really enjoyed the story...however the more I played, the more complaints I lobbied at it. Do yourself a favor and get Bioshock 2, try out Aliens vs Predator next week but you need your action fix and you're tired of Bayonetta or need a new action fix, go ahead but personally there's other games are better money purchases.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001C6GVI6","reviewerName":"D. A. Theisen","summary":"A Grand RPG Symphony","reviewText":"Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 is not for the faint-of-heart emotionally. No game yet created will be able to tug out as much emotion from you as a full playing here does. Moreover it is, without a doubt, an RPG made for adults. This alone is a feat of epic accomplishment -- when has a game (other SMT titles not included) ever used the 'M' rating for anything more than violence, language or sexuality? It today's society, it's hard for us to remember that \"adult situations\" come up in a lot of other ways, as well. Sure, there are some of those more common elements here, but... no, that's not what makes this \"for adults\".In short, if you're willing to open your heart to it and dedicate some of your time to it, Persona 4 will ultimately become the most immersive and emotional RPG you've ever played. The setting, characters, gameplay and its incredible story all combine in perfect harmony to give the result.For many years, I've wanted to be able to say that a new game was worthy of a highest-possible score (an effective 10/10 instead of just saying 5 starts of 5, which I list for 9 or 10/10 on my scale)... that something else was worthy... and I'm glad it's finally happened. Persona 3 and its FES epilogue version came ever-so-close, but Atlus has taken every aspect of P3 and enhanced it. To put it another way, any excuses anyone might have had to rain some scorn upon Persona 3 are now gone and you'll find yourself hard-pressed to come up with a single criticism of this game.It's been a long week for me. With a first clear time of 59hr 36min and having received the game 7 days ago (at time of writing this review), it's not hard to realize I've done nothing but dive into Persona 4 at times other than essential life functions. That doesn't include much sleep, naturally. Not a minute of that time was a waste....Alright, enough of the emotional ramblings. I suppose I should probably get to the actual content of the game itself.The game scenario is pretty standard for an RPG, and if you wanted to simplify it into a single line, you could call it a Scooby Doo murder mystery case. The protagonist is a transfer student to a high school in a small town, events unfold, you gain friends and allies, and you work for a common cause. A serial killer seems to be on the loose, killing people in ways no one can seem to collect any evidence from-to say nothing for finding any suspects. It's not long before you realize that you have a unique but inexplicable ability to try to combat the killer, and the hunt it on. This quick summary is the end of any type of simplicity you could give to P4. ...There's one extra thing worth noting as you begin. The opening movie just can't stand up to what we saw in P3. After all, it'd be damn hard to make a more shocking opening than one where there's a simulation of someone shooting themselves in the head with a pistol.The bare-bones start to the game lasts roughly 2 hours. It'll be another 2 before anything close to the normal flow of the game begins. It seems your town had some odd weather patterns and some urban myths to match, and the most famous being that watching a TV at midnight on a rainy night will show a picture of someone. Your soulmate, many say. This theory is quickly put to rest as people start to turn up dead. For American players, just a few murders hardly seem like something worthy of forming a such a game around. Just remember that this is Japan-ANY sort of violent crime is pretty much unheard of and a single act can put an entire city on edge. As the plot thickens, you can sense the rising tension amongst your school members and people around town.Quite quickly, you'll see that the game is unapologetically Japanese. Name tags are used based on relation, school lessons match and general customs are followed. Incredibly off-the-wall is the introduction of a giant fuzzy teddy bear as a character, who'll be sticking around with you the remainder of the game. ...Yea, definitely Japanese. If you're willing to overlook the fluff and fuzz, you will see that he's quite a strong character and a valuable member toward your efforts. If anything you should consider the culture gap content to be a good thing, since it means that only minor adjustments (at most) were made in the translation and adaptation of a North American release.Game flow is simple and easy to follow. You have school during days, your dungeon adventures occur in the afternoons, and your evenings are free to pursue your studies or do things with your relatives in the house. Days off and times you choose not to battle are when you'll form your \"Social Links\" and dive into the plethora of sub-stories, and your adventures in total will fall over a calendar year. One important difference between P3 and P4 is that each ally in your team has an individual social link, instead of just the girls. This is a lot more natural and will likely result in substantial guilt when you can't bring along certain members for certain missions... it's unlikely you'll really \"hate\" any of the characters since you really get to know them all at length.When you start to have carte blanche over your time, the game seems to be able to sense what you're trying to do and scold you appropriately. After a few trips into battle the first week it was available, I received a phone call from the infamous and series-recurring Velvet Room reminding me that I should be looking to get to know people in my new town. For those not familiar, the Velvet Room is a special place only the protagonist can enter where you'll be able to manage your Personas. Though this is important, a trait of the Persona series is the need to advance your social links with friends so that your Personas can become substantially more powerful as you develop and create them. In all seriousness, a Persona that is a few levels above your main character will make difficult battles substantially easier in a lot of places and gives you access to more powerful abilities. In short, a Persona is merely a facade of yourself that allows you to reveal more of your soul, and thus changes what you can do in battle based on what you put forward.Another awesome improvement over Persona 3 is the finer details of the plot. Not to say it wasn't complex, but there were times where you could be screaming at your TV wishing your characters would figure out something obvious. These moments are gone-actually, in almost every instance I came up with a new deduction about things it was addressed by others before my turn to speak. Shamefully, I must admit that there were times that my allies figured out some things before I did that resulted in a facepalm for me. This if far from a bad thing, of course! Just more proof of a very well-written story where it seems the authors thought through things and were able to anticipate what players were probably thinking at the time. The end result here is that plot twists are truly a surprise, yet are entirely logical once your team has a chance to sit around and discuss them.The characters you'll find here combine to make the greatest cast ever assembled for an RPG. Each has quirks, a sense of humor, running jokes, particular matters of irritation, etc.. The cross-character chatting actually gets so intense sometimes that they make very offense remarks to others regarding very serious topics such as gender orientation. Not one of your crew feels at all \"boring\" and the development of all of them is quite enjoyable.Always true to themselves, at some point everyone will probably annoy you temporarily and you'll grumble at the direction of your TV while glaring at them. Although (as you might expect in an RPG) all of the characters are dynamic in some way, their cores never change. My favorite instance of this was during a drinking game (yes, seriously) between friends where a particularly philosophical member has been forced into a situation where a lot of his-uh-\"Innocence\" was to be lost. On the spot and without hesitation, he spits out a haiku perfectly explaining what he has to do. It's not even an obvious thing and you have to REALIZE it's a haiku, though the fact he didn't spell it out for you makes it all the more hilarious. There are so many little moments like this and awesome lines from the whole crew that no cutscene is dull....Regarding the combat system, it's simply flawless. Though a major beef with P3 was the inability to directly control your allies, you now can... though... there were but 3 instances where I actually took control of the entire party. I know it was 3 because I can remember reach time and why I changed! The ally and enemy AI alike are just phenomenal. Similar to the facepalms in the story, I found my group members performing actions to disable or knock down foes that I didn't realize or completely forgot about. It's never a bad thing when your friends help you, and not vice-versa. Combat speed is rather fast if you let characters act on their own, Persona summoning is very crisp (another improvement), and every pleasant quirk from P3 is still there with even more fun battle details added. You'll also be happy to know that you can actually find out what Persona abilities do by pressing Square on the Persona selection menu, since there's no way you'll remember what each strange spell name means on your own.Of special note are the cross-member interactions during combat. This was already well-defined in Persona 3, but it's improved even further here and the banter between allies is almost continuous. Despite the limited number of lines they have, for some reason it never seems to get old.Actually, developing your social links with your group members helps play into the changes to the battle system. Depending on how advanced it is, they're able to take a mortal blow for you that would have otherwise resulted in your death and a \"Game Over\". Better still, they're able to cure you from annoying ailments including the dreaded charm. Quite literally, someone will run up to you and slap you in the face to get your attention. Best of all, if you're willing to push through the entire story for one of your allies, they'll develop the ability to survive a single killing blow to them and this is very strategically important in boss battles. Players of Persona 3 in particular will enjoy this, since taking time to raise your allies basically crippled you in difficult fights.Another little detail about dungeon improvements is that treasure chests will no longer spit out Yen. That was well and good of course, but also made no sense in P3. To counteract always being poor, the activities you use to increase your character statistics include part-time jobs that pay rather well. Your other primary source of income is the selling of innate materials dropped from defeated foes. Selling these off to a local shop unlocks new weapons and armor for you. Not remotely realistic, but as good of a system I've seen in a modern-era RPG nonetheless.Oh, and it's been pretty clear from a lot of the other reviews around that you need to do a ridiculous amount of exp grind to really do well. I beg to differ. If you'd like an indication of how much \"work\" I did, I completed each dungeon twice... once for the storyline and another to defeat optional bosses. In a few cases I did short sorties to particular places to collect items requested by the townsfolk for quests. Do note that although the \"fatigue\" factor is gone from P3, you no longer recover full HP/SP after returning to the entrance....Moving on to overall presentation of the game, you really can't ignore PS2 limitations anymore. Since the entire development process of Persona 4 has been after the PS3 was launched, it's unfortunate that the limited budget and resources of Atlus couldn't put this on the stronger system. Mind you, the graphics (in combat especially) are as good as you'll ever seen on the PS2, but hopping back to a game in HD will basically make your eyes bug out. Some kind of widescreen mode would have been awesome, but this is a very minor complaint and the lack of it doesn't subtract from the game in any way whatsoever.The soundtrack is top-notch, as you'd expect from any SMT title. Each separate dungeon has its own background music, which mixes things up nicely while walking around. There are hours upon hours of voiceovers from a talented cast that anime buffs will be able to pick out a few \"famous\" voices from. Another intriguing thing present this time is \"quazi-voiceovers\", where the text of a line will appear and you'll only get a short outburst from the other character. This could be a clip of an emotional reaction, or the first few words of the phrase. To me, this shows that Atlus might have loved to have put a voiceover on everything, but could have been running out of disk space. One thing that they made a specific point of including for voiceovers, however, is the \"final\" cutscene with each social link that brings you up to the max rank. It feels like an extra bonus for your effort and really puts the emotion from everyone out on the table....One thing I always love to talk about is details in games; it's often the little things that really make a scene stick with you or add a good memory to the game overall. The first such thing I saw in the game was when I was eating breakfast with my hosts and finished toast popped out of the toaster. It seems really tiny and insignificant, but it was so unexpected I actually jumped a little in my seat. If you're looking for a \"big\" example of details, naturally it would be the manga-like marks that appear above the characters quite often which explain their moods. Especially in cutscenes without voiceovers, it helps hold things together well.I also can't help but mention how well \"detail\" and dialogue is used in the Persona. As a voiceless protagonist, somehow you're still turned into an incredible character and member of your group. If it weren't for the fact that you're controlling him at all times and his ability to control multiple Personas is unique, you can easily imagine him being just any other normal person at school. It's a damn good feat of writing to allow someone without a voice to be both the \"main\" character and the strongest in most any sense of the word.The \"mood\" is also simply amazing. As you could expect, there is an eventual point in the plot where things have entirely hit the proverbial fan and things look incredibly grim. I can almost assure you that you'll be so sucked in to the game at this point that you'll literally have knots in your stomach waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. This is made all the more exciting by the fact that very few of the major events happen at times you would expect and you get a lot of short term changes you need to cope with....In starting a summary, it needs to be said that this game is not for everyone. It takes dedication to get the most out of this game. Although I'd like to think that anyone who has ever at any point played any type of RPG and enjoyed it would find Persona 4 to be an incredible experience, there are some players that can't handle hours without battle action, or the fact that it's hardly worth turning on your PS2 unless you have at least 1-2 full hours to play in order to make much progress.I'll kind start to finish this by giving a testimonial of my feelings throughout playing. At 10 hours in, I felt kind of disappointed. At 20, I'd adjusted to this. By 30, I was engaged. Hours 30 to 40 were hands-down the most I've ever enjoyed in any RPG (or game in general, actually). 40-Finish had me on the edge of my seat, and my first time at [AN] ending resulted in my crying for about 10 minutes.Oh... and as a last impression, I'd like to say that this game answers important questions in life, such as what happens when a protagonist is used as an underage male prostitute (indirectly). Perhaps you'd like to know what hints of fanservice from previous Persona titles would look like. Best of all, you might be curious to know what an 8-bit era dungeon crawling game would look like in 3D, and thankfully such a vital ponderance is answered for you. When's the last time you fought a boss that was a 16x16 block of pixels. That's what I thought....Conclusion-Just an incredible symphony here. At this point I'm not even sure if this truly my favorite RPG, but a somewhat objective view shows what is practically a flawless game that has corrected every imaginable critique it faced in its last release. There is still potential for great leaps forward in the Persona series, but at this time Persona 4 is worthy of the utmost praise for everything it gives you.Dare I say, Atlus is developing enough of a fanbase around the world now that releases are anticipated at nearly the same level of Square-Enix games? Might we finally have another true powerhouse in the RPG department which is slowly evolving past niche games to things anyone can enjoy playing? We'll have to see what Atlus can put together for the PS3 and/or 360, I suppose. They might not have the budget or resources of the SE-folk, but they have 10x the heart put into their titles right now. Not impressed enough yet? Go ahead and play through again on your cleared data to unlock everything available to you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

Spore gives you the chance to make worlds and beings that evolve, grow and delight you every step of the way.","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"DRM aside...","reviewText":"...The game can be quite fun.  For a short while.Like another reviewer complained, it doesn't matter if your creature has fifty legs or half of one, evolution pretty much plays absolutely no role in crafting your creature at all.  It's entirely a creationist game, as your creature doesn't at all \"evolve\", but is changed to your specifications.  That is, you can start with a two legged mammal-looking thing with claws for lips, and if you don't like it, you can completely change it to be a legless worm with eight eyes and wings, and if you don't like that, you can make a velociraptor with huge kneecaps and beefy arms.  So long as you unlock more parts to create with, you have absolutely free reign to mold your creature like clay.So the game clearly espouts creationism.The cell stage is simple, but it's quite fun, with your quest to eat little bits of plant or meat, while avoiding larger cells, and you can gradually evolve to put on spikes to poke the crap out of enemies, or poison sacks or electric butts to kill your foes, while the gigantic spiked amoeba that ate you every time you zipped past will soon become your primary source of food.Next, the Creature stage.  This is one of the most fun stages, as it consists of you controlling one of your creatures, hunting for food, either befriending other creatures by dancing, singing, and posing for them, or MURDERING them in front of their children, then eating their children in front of their women.If the creature stage had blood, it would be a damn awesome experience.  It can be a sheerly brutal play, with great pleasure to be had in hunting species down to extinction, or chasing an enemy away from its nest, while cracking all their eggs, and murdering their children when they try to come close.  It's also the only stage where you can do as much of the creature crafting/creationising as you can.  My recommendation is to explore all you can, find all the parts you can, and pick what you like, because you cannot \"evolve\" anymore past this stage.Tribal stage completely changes the gameplay, to something like a simplistic RTS where you hunt nonsentient creatures, or gather fruits and plants, and bring them back to camp, where food can be spent on musical instruments, weapons, or children.  The objective is to befriend and ally tribes, or destroy their village hut.  This stage is hell to go through, and is exacerbated by poor controls, an even poorer camera, constant raids on your food supply by tiny creatures that will literally camp on your food pile and suck as much as they can.Civilization stage is just a big mess of things thrown together as filler.  You have to waste time designing EACH and EVERY building and vehicle from scratch using the same system as designing your creature, and the vehicle can be as overburdened with crap as you want so long as all the right stats are in place.  This stage exacerbates all the poor control and camera problems in the previous stage, and all the gameplay consists of literal \"Feng Shui\" as you must precisely place homes, factories, and entertainment centers to get the most happiness and productivity out of your city.  If you're on an island, don't even bother building too many military vehicles---there is absolutely no way to get them over water, not even by transport.All the work in this stage is eventually rendered useless by the use of KIDDIE nuclear weapons, in particular the ICBM which destroys all cities that don't belong to you, and automatically moves you to the space stage.Space stage is the next awesome phase, borrowing heavily from the creature phase with regards to controls and camera, and lets you explore the entire galaxy available at hand.  And since you're on your own, there's no need to micromanage a city full of idiots with shoddy controls.So the Pros:- Free-range creature creation (though it's very much impossible to make something humanlike)- Bloodless murderous fun in Creature stage and Cell stage- Being an obnoxious empire in the Space stage- Low system requirements and small game size, while graphics and collision detection are still top-notchCons:- Insanely boring Tribal and Civilization stages- Insanely pointless Civilization stage (I beat this stage with nothing but military cities, no economy)- Limited number of parts makes you roam around a huge map for hours looking for thirty different variations of deformed-toe feet- Blatantly promoting creationism, thus allowing absolutely no role for evolution, and no purpose for any of the random appendages put on your creature save for the stats they grant.- Camera controls are among the worst controllable-camera controls in any game I've ever played.- Game controls post-Cell stage become sloppy and incoherent, causing such chestnuts in the Creature stage as trying to mate with another one of my kind, only to end up running past them and spinning in circles- Too many things to handle in the Tribal stage with not enough creatures to carry out all these tasks- Allies in every stage are completely useless for everything except not trying to kill you- Definitely biased towards murderous carnivores, as it's easily up to 3 or 4 times harder to impress and ally with another nest/tribe than it is to simply butcher them all and eat their corpses in front of their children- DRM~!!!!!- Taken from the class-action lawsuit claim regarding SecuROM DRM:(...)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2008"}

On the outside, you play Desmond, the ancestor of Altair and Ezio, who's hooked up to the animus (a virtual reality simulator) in order to uncover clues from the past to stop a threat from a powerful secret organization in the present.In the Virtual World you are Ezio, a young aristocrat whose family gets swept up in the political turmoil of 15th Century Italy.  As a fugitive, you avenge your family by taking a dark path and becoming an assassin.  You get your weaponry and gear from none other than Leonardo Da Vinci.  You also inherit a villa in the countryside that works as your own personal Wayne Manor.  If you upgrade the villa it becomes a huge source of income and a base of operations!  Ezio is up against the Templars, a holy military organization that will stop at nothing to acquire ancient powerful artifacts for their own selfish means.  Through the story, you meet many fascinating European historical figures with their own dark pasts.  Similar to the Da Vinci Code, the story may have you questioning your beliefs, researching historical figures, or wanting to take a more active role in the world around you.  It's rare that a video game story actually makes you want to rethink history.Gameplay:  8/10The gameplay is much improved over the original Assassin's Creed.  You have more weapons.  The combat system allows you to fight bare-handed, with a dagger, sword, two handed weapons, or even a pistol.  There are more ways to assassinate enemies; poisons, environment based stealth kills, or hire thugs to do your dirty work.  There are 15 different types of missions that will have you racing across rooftops, escorting allies, or assassinating targets.  If you are discovered, there are now more ways to evade capture.  The acrobatic free running / parkour part of the game has also been improved.  Ezio has more moves and fluidly traverses even the most perilous environments.Although, the gameplay is good, it's not perfect.  At times, Ezio may jump in the wrong direction and fall to his death.  This is extremely rare, but when it happens, it sucks.  Another criticism is that the combat doesn't offer much challenge.  You do have to think and react, but you never feel like you're going to lose a fight, even when 10 enemies attack you.  The only challenge to the combat is trying to take out all of the bad guys without getting hit at all.  A final criticism is that the running to a mission vs. completing the mission ratio is 3:1.  Although the free running is fun, there are points in the game where you do an awful lot of running and it starts to feel a bit tedious.Graphics: 10/10One of the best looking open world games of all time, in terms of art direction and quality.  The environments, characters, effects, and animations are all phenomenal.  The highly detailed buildings, clothing, and props all realistically fit the world.  The characters look and animate great right down to their facial expressions.  It actually feels like you were transported into 15th Century Italy!Sound:  10/10The sound track and sound effects are amazing.  The music is appropriate for the setting and gives a sense of action, mystery, and danger.  The sound effects put you right into the action or they'll make you want to seek comfort in the shadows as you stealthily plan your next assassination.  The soundtrack is also available on itunes!Replay Value:  5/10Assassin's Creed II offers 30-45 hours of gameplay, which is especially impressive in this day and age where most action games are 7 hours long.  After you finish the game, you have the option to keep everything that you've earned and continue playing to collect items, finish side quests, or unlock achievements.  However, there's no reason to start the game over from the beginning.  Even with limited replay value, you're still going to get your money's worth.Overall:  9.5/10When the story, art, and music are all amazing, you have a very immersive world.  The criticisms about Assassin's Creed II is that it doesn't offer much of a challenge, and it feels repetitive at times.Buy it if you liked Assassin's Creed 1.Buy it if you thought, I like the idea of Assassin's Creed, but I wish it was twice as exciting.Buy it if you liked Prince of Persia.Buy it if you want a thinking man's Action RPG.Rent it if you want to try it out and have about 30 free hours.Avoid it if you like a challenge or hated everything about the original Assassin's Creed.Avoid it if you are EXTREMELY Catholic.  The portrayal of the Vatican may upset you.Avoid it if you don't like the idea of being a dude, who's playing a dude, who's playing another dude.And there you have it.

I love GT2 and GT3, GT4 is fantastic and absolutely gorgeous but I thought they messed up the driving physics a little).  In GT5 the graphics are great, the physics are good, and it is overall a very good racing sim.  Considering how race cars are supposed to be driven, the feel is spot-on and quite addictive, but strangely the overall experience is kind of disappointing and frustrating.  Hard to describe.  The online racing is OK and will probably improve as patches become available.  Be aware GT5 has some glaring shortcomings.  First, the load times are long, sometimes very long, which can hamper any gaming experience especially online when trying to beat the countdown.  Second, some familiar tracks in the GT series are missing in this one: Seattle, Apricot Hill and Midfield are obvious omissions; also missing are Seoul, Hong Kong, and the traditional Rome circuit.  Although there are some great new tracks (Cape Ring is awesome), nothing is more entertaining than the 'staircase' in Seattle reverse and its absence is unforgivable.  At least Autumn Ring is also present.  Finally, the B-spec driver (let's call him Bob) is a complete idiot.  Granted, Bob starts with very little driving experience but come on, his driving is truly moronic.  I mean, really??!!  Bob will spin out the car, hit the brakes unnecessarily and often, and generally drive badly, as if the win is irrelevant.  I guess Polyphony forgot that auto racers will 'push.'  Even worse, if Bob finally gets a good lead, after passing the competition his temperament calms to a casual/cool level where the competition may catch up and pass him in a few laps.  Hopefully Bob's skill will improve rapidly with some progress through the B-spec portion.  I'm about 30% through the game, enough to give an adequate review.  This game gets a rather disappointing 3 stars, especially considering the long development cycle and the PS3's power and potential.EDIT: Update versions 1.06 and 1.07 recently came out -- they fixed some issues and improved a lot of the features in this game.  I am very pleased with these updates, and playing online I have heard other users say they are also very pleased with the recent updates.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

I have the Logitech Drive Force Pro GT along with NFS: Shift, Formula 1, and Grid. Unlike the games I just mentioned, the wheel works flawlessly with this game without any tweaking. As it should since the darn thing was designed in anticipation of this game. It's just SO much easier to drive. If words could convey just how frustrating it is to drive with this wheel on games such as Grid and Formula 1 compared to this phenomenal game I would. It was extremely refreshing to be able to just pop in the disk and just race without having to mess around with the wheel settings for five hours like my other racing games (I still don't have the settings right for Grid). The AI could be better I guess, and it's annoying that the real damage and all that realistic stuff doesn't happen until later in the game, and the update that had to be applied to the game before I could even play it was about an hour wait, but if that's all I have to complain about I think I finally found my racing game of choice for PS3. The selection of cars is great. Tuning and upgrading your cars are easy and simple yet somewhat detailed, but not so detailed that it leaves you feeling dumber for having tried. The amount of stuff to do in this game is ridiculous. From NASCAR to Rally to good old fashioned nostalgic Gran Turismo style racing fun, this game has it all. If you want to go the boring route and manage some drivers you can do that to. I don't foresee myself playing B-Spec (that's what it's called) but it's there if that's your cup of tea.All in all I love GT5. If you have a racing wheel and you enjoy racing games and you don't own this game then I STRONGLY recommend you do. It's challenging and rewarding enough to keep you going, while not being so difficult that it frustrates you to no end (I'm looking at you Grid!).

What is offers doesn't stray far from the competition, but the overall experience is tremendously unique. The aiming and movement has a sense of weight, but it doesn't hamper the experience. The visuals are gorgeous, and offer a true sense of sci-fi fantasy. The multiplayer has classes, three game modes, and plenty of room for teamwork and strategy. PlayStation Move is shown in full glory with the title, and presents an almost overwhelming sense of immersion.The campaign is the only soft spot for the title. The first 40% or so through the single-player mode isn't particularly impressive. The cutscenes and setting are great, but the story and gameplay aren't good at all. However, the last couple of hours are great, and one particular chapter is nothing short of amazing. Also, if you want to enjoy the game with a friend, split-screen co-op is available, and it's a welcomed addition.Simply put, this is the best FPS in at least a year. It's a blast to play, and doesn't feel like anything else on the market. The campaign isn't great, but suffices. The multiplayer is deep and very rewarding. This is an easy game to recommend to FPS fans, especially given the soft line-up of titles in the genre this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2011"}

I also have Mario Party 3 (for Nintendo 64), which is the best game in the series, and it has options to allow you to skip the CPU's mini-games and speed up the movement of the characters.  MP5 doesn't have this.  What it does have is special &quot;events&quot; and bonuses on nearly every space.The result is that it took me about 75 minutes to play a 10-turn game the other night, when I can play a 15-turn game of MP3 in less than an hour.I do not like the concept of the &quot;capsules,&quot; either.  Instead of buying bonus items from stores, you get a &quot;free&quot; item every time you pass a gumball machine, and you have to pay to use it.  Problem is, the game asks you before every turn whether you want to use a capsule or not.  Annoying!Also a problem (in this game even more than the other MP games) is the excess of animations that slow down the game even more. The boards also seem to be overly complex... sometimes you'll go through an entire game and none of the players will ever get a star.The mini-games, which are the heart of any MP game, seem very dull.  Only a couple seemed not to be derivative of the previous games.  On the plus side, the graphics and sound, of course, are very nice, especially the 3-D game boards.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

This is obviously not a good sign.I played it twice. Once as a bad guy, and once as a good guy. Being a good guy is way easier than being a bad guy. Namely because you get the option to get energy when you shoot things. The first time probably took me 20 hours and the second time took me about 5.The story was interesting, but unfortunately at the end, you wanted to like it a lot more than you did.The graphics were pretty lame which is not a huge deal to me, but the city was extremely boring and monotonous which bothered me a lot.I also would have liked a better set of upgrades. Many of the upgrades are just absolutely worthless.Glitches.A fair number of times my x-axis controls would get inverted, but I would just jump a few times and they would reset.A number of enemies just sat floating in space when they were dead.Many times, especially with the (sniper rifle), your shot would just stop in front of the person or hit something that wasn't in the way.There are no huge pitfalls from my point of view, and if this game came out 3 years ago, I would have given it a 4.5. However, with Spiderman doing a really good job, and Prototype knocking it out of the park, there is no way I can give this a higher rating knowing what is possible with a game like this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

I played the demo and decided to give it a go and I'm very glad I did. This is a very good game. The graphics are not Uncharted like, but they are pretty good and sharp. The music goes with the gamplay and action. The controls are very smooth. Binary Domain feels a bit like a cross of Vanquish and Gears of War. The voice on the characters are kind of silly at times, but I dont mind it much other than some of the AI you have to haul as part of your team repeat the same lines a few times too many. Still does not take much from the actual gameplay where you are fighting robots (I-robots)armored robots and huge a.. robots! That keep on coming to you. If you shoot most in the legs, they will crawl and try to get to you like a Terminator. The guns sound almost like Gears of War where they are powerful but the sound is not realistic.The only complaint is that there is not a lot of people online to play. As you can imagine, there will be even less people to play once Mass Effect 3 releases. But there is a mode in multiplayer in which 4 players can take on a slew of robots kind of like Horde for Gears.The game is good enough and fun to give it a try.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Saints Row 2 + GTAIV = Game of the Gods","reviewText":"As the title implies, I found certain things between this and the GTA series that made the game great, and few things between the two that made me want to grind my teeth down to nubs.SR 2 picks up rather well after the end of the initial release. You, a Hispanic/African American/oddly hispanic looking but with a cockny accent, awake in a maximum sercurity prison after being blown up at the end of the first game. After an alarmingly easy prison break (I'd expected the tutorial levels to consist of cafeteria fights and an eventual guard bribe, or at least something to reestablish the background other than a 2 minute dissertation), your character proceeds to rebuild the 3rd street saints. You've apparently also had a significant amount of facial reconstruction, as its commented on by just about everyone, and also manages to help you free your best friend and head lieutenant after walking past 40-something cops and security guards.This highlights my only real problem with the games, which is its storyline difficulty. Its far too easy. I expect games to increase in difficulty as they progress, and to a degree it does, but not enough to be more than barely noticeable. Story missions can all virtually be done on the frist try unless you happen to stumble by an exploding car. Your health regenerates if you manage to dodge enough bullets, and you can take more punishment than Robocop, despite having no kevlar or any armor, even on normal difficulty. The diversions and jobs however, more than make up for this. They all consist of 6 levels, the 3rd of which can be completed with 1-3 retries, and the 6th apparently can only be done by people who obsess over these kinds of games to a degree thats unhealthy. The difficulty is also variable, as enemies vanish and appear at random.Despite this nit, which is a big one, this game is fantastic. The jobs are fun, and some of them could make a game on their own. A few will make you wince, nmely the one where you spray poo on everything that moves, but aside from, the side missions are almost more fun than the story missions. The story missions are also fantastic. While none so far have made my jaw drop, they are unique enough to not feel repetitive, they are well voice acted, and have a compelling storyline for each of the gangs, and a few you'll gleefully replay over and over, as the villians get theirs in rather entertaining ways (Case in point: \"Get up.\" You'll know it once you reach it)The customization is fantastic, and creative, though a few points are obscure, namely why some items are more stylish than others. The guns are entertaining, and a bit too easy to acquire. Items are cheap, so you won't have to grind for 10 hours to buy new gear or houses. The AI for enemies and your allies is vastly improved. All told, if this was made a little harder, and a little gritter, just a drop or two, this would've been 5-stars, and probably a top ten of all time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"Almost obscenely fun","reviewText":"Does this play like a clone of a GTA game? Absolutely, in almost every respect. This doesn't hurt the game, however, because it is like the retard kid brother that, unlike the GTA series, never managed to grow up. That sounds critical, but I'm actually trying to articulate just how juvenile and downright fun this game is. Here we have bright colors in place of the muddy browns and grays of Liberty City. Here we have outlandish and hilarious story-lines in place of GTA IV's tragic street opera. Here we have offensive and amusing stunts in place of the gritty and realistic side-quests you'll find in GTA IV. I am not kidding when I say that the game actually includes minigames where you run around town flashing people or where you're driving a septic truck around town shooting a violent brown stream at unlucky passersby. There are many, many more fun mini-games than just these, but these should give you a sense of what the game is like. The highlight of the game is undoubtedly the customization system, which is one of the most elaborate I've ever seen. This applies to almost everything. Ever wanted to play as an obese black man with a pink afro wearing nothing but a bra and a great big smile on his face? You can do that. You can play as pretty much any type of person you can imagine. I can't stress how many hours I've spent just tinkering around with various hair-styles, tattoos, outfits, fighting styles, and the like.If there is a downside to this game, it is that it lacks the deep world found in GTA IV. That game was absolutely astounding for all of the various secret characters and side-quests you had to choose from. No such unplumbed depths here. Also, while I didn't mind at all, the production values on this aren't great. The controls are a bit too loose, the graphics remind me of very early XBOX 360 games, and the game is quite buggy at times. This last aspect is most damaging at times. Nevertheless, it wasn't bad enough to spoil the fun for me.All-in-all, this is a ton of fun, and a nice alternative to the grim and gritty world of GTA IV.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Did what GTA IV couldn't do, but has it's own flaws","reviewText":"The Good: Super fun missions, great dialog and voice acting, huge open world, plenty of things to doThe Bad: Some technical issues, does redefine the genre, lame multi playerThe sandbox or \"open-ended gameplay\" genre is actually the newest genre known to video games with a good seven years under it's belt, but not that many games have really proven the genre worthy. With Grand Theft Auto III being the daddy of this genre many games were failed mock-ups of GTA, many weren't even related, but still didn't do the genre justice. Saint's Row tried to push the genre once again a few years ago and didn't do such a great job, and was just shoved off as another GTA clone. Now that Saint's Row 2 has been out for awhile people kind of just stopped with blank expressions, while some roared and cheered with joy. Saints 2 really does push the genre and is a clear oppenent against Grand Theft Auto IV, but I'm not going to sit here and compare the two since Saints 2 deserves a seperate look.The first thing you do when you enter the game is create your own character, and this is what really sets the game apart from others in the genre. You wake up from your coma in a jail hospital and bam you're in there changing your sex, picking your taunts (some are very vulgar), rearranging your face (you can do that in that outside of this too), picking hair, and even your voice. The options are deep and riddled with lots of ways to make your character unique and stand out from others online. Once you get out of this mode you are introduced to an easy to use tutorial that will show you how to control your character and I have to admit; the controls are wonderful. I never got frustrated with them and they are just so intuitive and easy to understand and remember. You start out with some melee training then you pick up a pistol and you discover you can zoom in via over the shoulder, jump around, and it all just feels nice and smooth. Once you hop into a car this doesn't change one bit since cars will turn on a dime and have the perfect feel to them (all 40 or so of them) and this makes driving around the city of Stilwater very pleasant.The bulk of the game is about rivaling gangs through the story and I have to admit the story is riveting, gruesome, and very entertaining and never falters once. You see, since you were knocked out for two weeks all the gangs who hated you took their territory back and now you must gather your old friends, start the 3rd Street Saints up again and build your hideout up. In this hideout you can get your cash from the stores you purchased, change your gangs style (like 80's, hip-hip, pimps & hos that sort of things), change your weapon layout, and pimp out your crib. All of these are just nice subtle touches that THQ didn't really have to do, but they went that extra mile anyway.Between these story missions you can go to different stores an buy food (health), jewelry or clothes to increase your respect, go to plastic surgeons to redo something on your character, buy cars, buy weapons, and the second half of the game: Play side missions.These side missions are actually a blast and two I will talk about are Fuzz and Septic Avenger. Most of the side missions are scattered throughout your map (Stilwater is HUGE by the way) and they consists of events such as racing, celebrity protection, helicopter attack missions etc. All of these missions earn you respect so you can play story missions (each story mission takes one piece of your respect bar). Each mission gives you a time limit and a certain objective to complete, while some are wasy others are a pain in the @SS and can leave you screaming in frustration. Fuzz is a cop reality show where you drive around to designated crimes and kill them according to what your camera man says. Sometimes you'll have to use a chainsaw (camera angle a la Gears of War), use satchel charges on skateboarders etc. Fuzz is an addictive (like most missions) way to fill your respect bar and leaves many laughs as well (thanks to the amazing dialog THQ wrote for the game). Septic Avenger has you driving a septic trucks (yeah a poop truck) spraying fecal matter all over buildings to depreciate the value for certain clients. As you spray the buildings a red meter will drop and a cash amount will pop up bringing that much closer to your depreciation amount.There are also some other smaller side missions like the taxi missions, hostage diversion in which you hijack a car and any passengers can be driven crazy (literally) until a ransom is given. You also have a streaker mission since you CAN walk around naked (blurred naughty bits of course) and streak in front of people for cash.If you think the side missions sound fun don't forget those story missions. The game has amazing voice acting and clever dialog so it'll keep you wanting more and making you come back to see which gang member you're going to kill next. Not one missions is identical and you are blessed with a non repetitive mission based game that gives you many different places, and way to kill people throughout the entire game.Now when it comes to nitpicking the game apart the graphics aren't up to par with most next-gen games (thanks a lot Gears of War 2!), there are serious slow down problems where the FPS will drop into the single digits some times, there are collision detection and clipping issues, some funky physic problems, but nothing that sandbox games haven't encountered before. The game is highly playable and you shouldn't let these small problems bother you. The last thing I need to mention is the fact that the game is gruesome and is more ballsy than GTA ever was. There are complete torture scenes, foul language, and running around naked a la Sims style is pretty far out there. The game is just hard hitting and in your face and that's exactly what a mature rated sandbox game needs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I too am a trained martial artist & have also had boxing training.Yet, when I 1st started playing my fighter had the punching prowess of a wet noodle..The KEY to this game & EVERY other game, is learning the games controls & trajectory tracking system.Then, just like you are taught in martial arts training or any other fighting training, you adapt, improvise & overcome...Its an awesome game.. You also have to build up your fighters stats. There is a technique & stamina meter that can increase the fighters targeting & accuracy.Also your opponents move around & dont just stay in one spot, which may explain why many are missing their punches.. Remember that old saying, \"Board dont hit back\"? Your opponents are not going to just stand there & let you beat the crap out of them..I would love to give this game a 5 star rating, but there are two minor annoyances that I have.Like others have stated, some of the special dirty moves dont work all the time & are cumbersome. Partly because they are awkward to execute in a fast paced fighting match, & they dont flow naturally.The Windmill Punch is a prime example.Also, the head tracking system ALWAYS fails when the actual fight starts. I thought that it was just me that it was happening to. But I am glad to see that other have had the same issue. Maybe they can perform a update patch for this.. Because I like to duck & throw body punchhes & the \"X\" button is hard to use when you are trying to move the fighter in close at the same time.What would be really cool is that you could create your own fighter with specific facial & body attributes like in Fight Night.Overall though this game is excellent & has major replay value. Hopefully the developers of this game will go on to develop other Move controller based games because they are definitely on the right track with this one.This is an edit.After further playing the game I have a couple of extra gripes. There are no options to change button configuration like most games have, not to mention when you start the game you are only have one profile you are allowed. If there was button reconfiguration allowed, I would move the camera view button (triangle) to the select botton on the side of the move controller. The buttons are so close that during a fight its easy to ACCIDENTLY change the camera view & totally throw your whole perspective off. Meanwhile you are getting the crap beat out of you trying to get it back..Secondly-Online gameplay is hard to find matches. I think the option to play in different venues like the Chapel, UnderPass, etc is cool, but there should be an option where one can just select the 1st available match who doesnt care where they fight. Currently, you have to go into each venue, wait for the server to connect you to the venue, & then sit around & wait for a match..And Last-I think the Dirty fighting is cool, but what I dont like is the ability of players who have no skills whatsoever that just throw wild piston punches and win because they play with cheats and you can literally beath them to death & their energy or stamina goes no where. And my stats are maxed out also so its not that my fighter isnt strong enough. No lie I totally beat the crap out of this guy with awesome hooks, uppercuts, & solid punches. I must have hit him 50 times & still would not go down. He must have got me 15 times & KO'd me.. Thats BS...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

The control bugs, choppy frame rate and frustrating combat at times kills the joy for someone with high expectations for what once was a masterpiece.It almost feels like this was rushed out the door in 1 year to beat a deadline or something (maybe bioware is paranoid about the end of the world... or the end of their own company)Don't get me wrong, it is Mass Effect but a different one. The first was massive, the second played more like a traditional FPS with modest exploration capabilities and the third offers even less. While the level design is beautifully executed the environments are not as massive as they once were.The moment you get in the game you feel claustrophobic, being restricted to explore limited areas. A bit later in the game areas open up for exploration but this gives you a very limited perspective.The PS3 version is plagued with frame rate issues at times that make gameplay less enjoyable, highly difficult and frustrating. The controls suck especially when you're running and your character gets stuck to a wall thinking you wanted to use it for cover - this ultimately gets you killed filling you with anger and urge to snap the game disk in half.I only give it five stars in respect to the reputation this game has built with the previous two installments (all combined are awesome) but taken individually this doesn't deserve more than 2 stars.And I've said it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"Absolutely the best superhero game since Arkham","reviewText":"If you are looking for an incredible Justice League movie, you have to go no further than this video game. The cinematics on this are simply amazing. The plotline of the game is simple: a handful of heroes are pulled into a parallel universe where Superman is bad and has taken many of the Justice League with him. While you go to this game for the fighting, the single player mode gives you the most compelling story you could imagine. I am at best a casual gamer and never sit down to complete a game in one sitting, but this one kept me glued to the television until I have finished it. There are plot twists galore in this thing, and one in particular late in the game has Superman killing one of his associates in the such a way that it left both my son and myself speechless because that moment shows you this Superman has no hope of change.And the storyline just makes the fighting times make sense. You get 12 chapters here which means you'll fight as 12 different heroes, most of the time facing 5 opponents before the chapter ends. There is also a section of bonus missions through STAR labs which will let you continue on with another story (though without cinematic action) much longer than the main storyline and allowing you to play as all the characters eventually. There is a quick fight mode, and of course multiplayer that will allow you a lot of fun. Completing the game gives you a new costume (after the closing credits roll) for Superman. You can also download more character skins and even newer fighters are supposed to come out soon. This is definitely the game to grab if you are a comic book fan!And yes, Kevin Conroy is Batman in this one. Yet another reason to buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"This is why you should buy a 3DS ~","reviewText":"I got my copy from Amazon.com directly a couple of days late, but hey, I'm patient.  (I noticed that it is still listed out of stock from Amazon, but I did get mine from them - $39.99 and free Prime shipping - and not a marked up 3rd party seller).  It did score a 9.6 on IGN (my recommended game review site), but has garnered top scores from most major video game publications and ratings sites.  I count this among the three MUST buy 3DS games: Mario Kart 7, Super Mario in 3D Land, and now Fire Emblem Awakening.  This is not a remake of an earlier Fire Emblem game, and this shows the amazing potential of this handheld system when developers put forth the effort.And patience is being rewarded.  Over the years I have played this series, mostly fan translated versions on various emulators on phones, PCs and Tablets.  I actually started replaying the old titles in anticipation of this one.So, I'm not too far in the game, but I wanted to give a few first impressions.  First of all, man up (or woman up) and select the regular difficulty and do not set the option to revive dead characters.  Part of the fun of Fire Emblem is trying to keep your players alive despite overwhelming odds.  If you are itching for some bruising, then up the difficulty for the first time through.  There are two ways this changes the gameplay for me.  If I play through on the higher difficulty setting the first time, then I lose more characters.  So then when I play through again, I try to keep more of them alive, OR I pop the difficulty down a bit and try to keep more folks alive.  On the other hand, if you play through at a lower difficulty, you probably keep more characters alive, therefore seeing their stories progress, thereby giving you a more rounded out experience.  And then on subsequent plays through you can up the difficulty.  But then you already know how some characters' stories pan out, so you might be tempted to save the ones that have the 'better' stories or the ones that you may have lost on a previous play through.  It's really up to you.  And you can unlock even tougher settings beyond the already insanely tough 'Lunatic' setting.The battle system is solid Tactical JRPG.  I would say this game bears some similarity to Shining Force (Sega Genesis) and Advance Wars.  But it also bears some similarity to the classic TRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea.  Battle is carried out on a top down grid.  When you enter an attack, it cuts to a special attack screen.  The cuts look AMAZING.  And battle is fluid and fun.  You have to plan ahead, and if you don't then you're going to get owned.  Especially on higher difficulty settings.  But the old battle style is similar but with some tweaks, such as the partner system (much like Disgaea, Gungnir, Ragnarok Tactics and others) where you get an assist from a nearby unit.The graphics are jaw dropping for a system that weighs only a couple of pounds and has tiny little cartridges.  The 3D scaling is simply perfect in this game.  Not like some of the other lazy games that are remakes or obvious budget minded developments.  Instead of just layers of 3D, this game has visual depth.  You have to see it to believe it.There is a ridiculous amount of customization in this game.  You can pretty much tweak the settings to achieve whatever game play style you want.If you haven't played a Fire Emblem game before, then do yourself a service and get this game!  It's tougher than a lot of other Tactical RPGs out there, but also have fast gameplay which sets it apart from Ragnarok Tactics and even Gungnir.  The gameplay and story will keep you glued to this game for hours.  And you WILL want to play it over again.  It's the most replayable SRPG series since the old Ogre Battle / Tactics Ogre titles.  I'm not through it yet and I am already looking forward to changing some things up on my next play through.  And unlike Ragnarok Tactics, the game is fast and fun and really great to play through!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2013"}

Although their time with their home console system the Gamecube, seems to be winding down, amny people are still enjoying the success of Nintendo's handheld, the DS system. Earlier this year, the company redesigned the DS to a smaller compact editon, the DS Lite, which is just as delightful, and easy to play as the original DS. Unfortunately, the design only came into one particular color, a simple white. Well, now they are going to make the world of black come around the DS Lite.The Nintendo DS Lite in a dark Onyz Black, is a sleek and stylish way of bringing your gaming on the go. Like the original DS system, you have the portability of original DS games, as well as the compatability of Game Boy Advance games too like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3, and Dr. Sudoku. There are also so many great DS games that are highlighted even better than ever on this system from the fast & the furious racing action of Mario Kart DS, to puzzling brain teasers including the popular Brain Age and Big Brain Academy. The system also comes with a stylus which is a bit bigger than the original ones for the original Nintendo DS, but works like a glove, and has a recharageble battery that lasts as long as before. The system handles comfortably and it is easier to play games from before, with the repositioned controls, and sound.All in all, if you're a fan of video games, you have many different choices from the PSP, to the upcoming Nintendo Wii. But, the Nintendo DS is a very challenging and exciting video game system that is not only worth the price you pay for it, it delivers so much fun.

It's rare that a game comes along that is so well made, so engulfing, that you forget you're only playing a game.  Not only has this game raised the bar for first person shooters, it's changed the way they're played completly.While games such as \"Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault\" were well made and fun, they lacked the true experience of war.  With Call Of Duty it's hard not to believe you're in the second world war.  Whether you're leading a squad of American Paratroopers in an assault on a French town occupied by the Germans, a British SAS Commando attempting to hold the Pegasus Bridge, or leading Soviet Tanks in the blitz to Berlin you feel like you're living it.  But what really makes the experience complete are your fellow soldiers, with some of the best friendly AI this gamer has ever seen.  You wont have to babysit them because they can hold their own, but if you want to live you'd better work with them.The multiplayer is good, while nothing earth shattering it can hold it's own and is a bit more on the realistic tip then Day Of Defeat or Battlefield 1942.  However, with the recently released United Offensive expansion gamers will now be able to use tanks, jeeps and more in multiplayer modes, which will most likely change the gameplay for better.You'll cringe as the bullets from a German MG-42 whiz past your head.

I'm usually not a fan of hack and slash type games, but this one has turned out to be quite entertaining.Like other games in this genre, Dark Alliance is a third person perspective game (kinda 2.5D) in which you venture through cellars, mines, dungeons and even outdoor environments like mountain and villages. Levels typically end with a \"boss\" of varying difficulty and combat style. Gameplay is mixed with first person cut scenes in which you converse with other characters in a multi-choice format.Interestingly, you can only save your game at certain points.  At first this seems annoying, but there are enough save points around the game so it isn't too bad.  Another big plus is that saving is really quick.  If you've played games like Morrowind, where saving and loading are good opportunites to grab a drink, then you're in for a treat.  Unfortunately you can only save about 25 games at once and there is no way to describe the saved game.  A bit annoying, but oh well.I'm not too much of a D&D; fan, so I can't comment on how true this game is to the ruleset. However, as you move through the game you'll acquire better goods and have to manage your inventory and make decisions about how to develop your powers as you advance levels. Who knows if these mechanisms are authentic enough, but they are fun.. :)Finally, one of the best aspects of the game (and why I ended up purchasing it) is the two player option. This put two players on the screen at the same time, working together to battle through the game. I find this style of multiplayer play to be much more enjoyable than split screen, and this is one of the few games that offers it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2002"}

Not a good combination...","reviewText":"I expected a lot coming in to World at War because I had been reading about WWII quite a bit lately and thought a quality PS3 game on it would be fun.  Although there were some areas of the game that worked, they were far over shadowed by the more annoying aspects of the game that ruined it for me.The pros: beautifully rendered world, tight storyline, cool weapons and vehicles.  The world itself is beautifully rendered.  The landscapes look so real when fighting Japan and Germany that it helps bring you into the WWII world.  The destruction of cities and the destruction of human life is, seemingly, accurate.  At times you will see a wounded soldier rolling around on the floor, or a Japanese soldier running around caught on fire with his arms flailing everywhere.  You couldn't help but be fascinated by the world you were experiencing.  The storyline is very accurate to the actual WWII history, not too mention the tactics of the four nations during the war is well rendered. Finally, I couldn't help but have fun with the flamethrower and the tank, two aspects that I had a surprising amount of fun with.The cons: Facial features and annoyingly constant death.  The facial features are no where near up to the level of the rest of the game.  All too often they just looked like some zombies or corpses walking, which was a striking contrast to the beautiful landscape and world.  Finally, the absolute killer for the game was the absolutely numerous number of times that you die.  You are always seeing a grenade indicator and usually would always die if you are anywhere in the vicinity.  You would die so often and repeat the checkpoint so often that you are constantly getting so annoyed that you want to stop playing right there and exchange the game for something else.  The game certainly could have done away with half the grenades and made it so that you didn't die so often and still had a very real feeling game.  This, of course, was their objective.  And though death is real feeling in World at War it doesn't need to be so much since all that does is take the enjoyability out of playing.I still can't get over how fun an experience it was to storm Shuri Castle in Okinawa and the Reichstag building in Germany, giving you such a well rounded experience in just seeing the beautiful architecture, only to have them blown to bits by war.  Some of the more redeeming values of the game.  Unfortunately the annoying aspect, which no game should ever become annoying, completely overcomes everything else and left me with a game that I probably never play again.

Unfortunately, this game let me down, and could not hold my interest. I had to force my way through the last third of the game, although I did manage to finish it (and see the unsatisfying ending).The primary problem with \"Enslaved\" is that there is something not quite right with the framerate, which is incredibly distracting and detracts from the graphics and overall experience. After experiencing the smooth animations of the Uncharted series and similar titles, I just couldn't look past the herky-jerky movements of this game's protagonist.On the positive side, the artistic direction is fantastic, and I love the way the post-apocalyptic world is portrayed so colorfully. The story is original, although not fully realized and lacking in character development for Monkey.I applaud the developer for trying something new, and I hope they continue to make innovative titles.

Noire, I was curious, but did not truly understand the whole premise of face expression mapping that was one of the selling points of the game.  Nevertheless, I knew Rockstar was a sure-bet when it came to great games (with the obvious exceptions of Red Dead Revolver, Max Payne 2 and Manhunt 2), so I picked it up.  Now, I've never really spent too much time watching the old detective crime movies based in that era, but this game was presented in very much the same fashion as Red Dead Redemption - in the fact that it played out with movie-plot quality.  I was captivated.  The gameplay is easy, the gunfights are numerous enough to keep it fun, and finding clues and piecing them together really makes you think.  While it may seem like one clue by itself may not be that significant, it can be at times - and with a couple of the cases, one elusive clue is the key to everything.Now, the interrogations are both fun and tedious.  The minigame that is the interrogation gives you topics to ask them about, and three choices to how you see their answers - truth, doubt, or lie.  Watching their facial expressions, listening to their explainations, and their tone of voice is key in determining which it is.  Based upon how well you read people, it can either make the case a whole lot easier or a whole lot harder.  The four portions of Detective Cole Phelps' career (Traffic, Homicide, Vice, and Arson) that come after his patrol days are fun, although I had the most fun with the Traffic and Homicide portions.The story takes a turn for the worse at the end of the vice portion (though I won't spoil it), and makes you really see that even someone as noble as the hero Phelps has their vices.  The flashbacks in-between cases gives you a glimpse at situations he encountered during his time in the Marines in World War 2, and become increasingly relevant to the overall story.  The character acting is great, the emotions are very well done by the programmers, and the music brings about the feeling that you're actually in the 1940s.There were alot of people who put time and energy into this game (just read the credits, you'll see), and it is a great game, but as I see it, only as a rental or a cheaper purchase.  Because it is linear in its story and you can't pick and choose which cases you take before others, it can't compare with games like Grand Theft Auto 4.  It is a good game, but not perfect, in that aspect.Still, it's worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

You only lose a little cash, so after a while you don't really care if you die or not.Story, get off island before it's too late.

Personally I've never expected much from a Wario game. Surprisingly enough, the Wii has done some really positive things however for the third wheel that Wario's always been in the Mario universe. This is a 2-D sidescroller that is a welcome throwback to games like Sonic and Donkey Kong Country. The game itself blends a very basic, oldschool controller setup with some of the more advanced motion functions of the Wii remote (much like New Super Mario Bros. does). The gameplay varies enough from a Mario game to stand out on its own and actually manage to be memorable. My only real complaints with this game are the length and the bonuses. The game's fairly short. And while there are collectibles throughout the stages that would normally be reason enough to warrant a high replay value, the bonuses you receive for obtaining these collectibles are nothing that really offer anything exciting to the gameplay. If you're anything like me, you'll probably want to beat the challenges anyway. Just don't expect too much excitement in the way of rewards. Otherwise, this is a stupendous game.

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Chris A.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Although the junction system can seem very complicated, that doesn't mean it is. It's actually very simple: you use magic to enhance your stats and resistence.......that's it!The summonings (also known as GF's, Eidolons, Espers, Aeons etc...)have been made more complicated by making it so that you can use them to learn new commands like turning monsters into cards. However as a party you can become very dependant on these monsteres because it is so much easier just to watch them take off heaps of damage reagrdless of what you do instead of attempting to get a weapon upgrade. And watching the cutscene of them killing monsters over and over again can get tiring very quickly. What I do is only use them in boss battles and try and learn J-Atk as quickly as possible to increase your own attack......you'll understand.What this FF game is the first to do is create a card game. It is very addictive and is weirdly enough more advanced than the card game in FF9 (mabye they were trying to go for simple addictiveness) and trying to find every single card can sometimes absorb aaaaaaaaaaaall you're time until it's gone...be careful.Buy it!

It is an arcade flight shooter with tactical elements, and this installment mixes things up by including on-foot and vehicle missions.I like how Factor 5 dared to be different this time around. You get to play as an AT-ST walker and direct Ewoks to trigger their traps on Endor. You also get to relive the famous speeder bike chase, and thanks to some truly stunning graphics this scene is just as cool as it was in the movie. In fact a lot of this game covers sequences that the previous installment, Rogue Leader, didn't cover. If you put the two games together you pretty much get a complete Star Wars Trilogy package.The flight missions are still top-notch. The Jedi Starfighter makes a cameo this time around, and you get to drop those cool seismic charges like in the movie. The on-foot missions though, are somewhat problematic. You can run around and blast Stormtroopers, but the controls feel a bit loose and the aiming reticle doesn't always latch onto the person you want to shoot at. Jumping can become a royal pain, especially in the Dagobah and Sail Barge missions. Overall these missions are playable, but their unrefined qualities make them too easy compared to the flight and vehicle missions, and they work mostly as a mild diversion.We also get a bunch of bonus content in Rebel Strike. ALL of Rogue Squadron is available in 2-player co-op mode, and I'm surprised Factor 5 managed to squeeze it all in. There are dvd bonuses like art galleries, a making-of, and even audio commentary. There's also the 80s Star Wars arcade games wrapped in a funky disco-themed menu.

I have spent several weeks with it now, and I think the art style is crisp and well done, and looks very good in high definition. I think the animations are easily distinguishable on-screen during the action, and the background and foreground art is brilliant. The platforming aspect of the game is tried-and-true and very reminiscent of other Sony platformers like Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, etc. Defeat in the game comes not as a continue screen, but an immediate reboot to the most recent \"checkpoint\" the game thinks you passed (the checkpoints are transparent to the user as you play, you won't know where they are unless you have to reset to one).The music is peppy & folksy, with stuff like whistling, guitar and banjo strumming, and breezy tunes playing under the action. The game includes a neat little element where you get a helper which you can order to interact with the environment to help you as you go. This can include distracting a giant enemy by tickling it so you can defeat it, or lowering bridges for you, cutting ropes, etc.The overall premise of the game seems to be that the dreamland Rayman inhabits is under attack, and you need to save the denizens of the land in each level to progress. Each chapter/stage (and some levels) include a story-teller voice (and sometimes animated sequences) which advance the overall story of the game. Each level has a certain number of people to save, including a \"king\" and \"queen\" who will give you extra health when you save them. Saving them also involves a mini-game instead of just freeing them in the level, and you have to find the door to their mini-game to get to them (usually hidden away by back tracking, or under a ledge you might just climb up and pass, or up out of the way of the normal path you are following -- in other words, explore to find them).The game lets you change the \"skin\" of the character you play in a heroes gallery. You start out with a set number of them from the beginning, then earn more as you progress through the game. I was partial to playing as the princesses I rescued, myself. You can also win trophies for collecting Lums in each level, and you can win \"lucky\" lottery tickets which can earn you Lums, character skins, and other items.The layout and organization of the game is a bit confusing, and because they give you the freedom to wander around outside of the game proper, I can see that confusing and frustrating younger gamers. The game is also non-linear, you can access levels out of order, and stages out of order, as you unlock them -- that again can be confusing for younger gamers, so I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who can't read yet (as all of the instructions are presented as on-screen text, with no voice), and who is at least 6-8 years old.But, like I said, overall the game is fun, very pretty, has good music, solid platforming, and fun mechanics. I didn't encounter any elements of horror, sadism, extreme violence, strong language, or any nudity/sexuality -- so I would say the game is suitable for all ages (even if they aren't old enough to actually play it yet).4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"During the PS2's lifecycle, the FPS genre as a whole has been surprisingly underwhelming for the system.  Sony's own Killzone was supposed to change all that, being labeled a \"Halo killer\" when first unveiled.  Well, here we are only a few years later, and the original Killzone is still pretty underwhelming itself.  Killzone puts you in the shoes of one of four playable characters as you battle in an interstellar war.  What sets Killzone apart from other FPS' is the game's very well done story and ideas.  The game's story alone will make you want to get further into the game to see what happens next.  Whether or not that happens though is entirely up to you.  The single player mode is lengthy and is heavy on action elements, but there are a number of noticeable glitches and bugs that mar the graphics and gameplay.  Thankfully though, the multiplayer mode is pretty sweet, even though there are some lag problems when you take Killzone online.  The game also features some great cinematics and voice acting to boot, but it's just a crying shame that more time wasn't put into getting the bugs out and getting rid of the overly generic feel that is prevelant throughout the game's length that would have made Killzone something special.  All in all, Killzone isn't a bad FPS for the PS2, but one can't help but feel disappointed after playing it.  Hopefully Sony's next installment for the next-gen will be every bit as drool-worthy as it seems to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2007"}

Buy it! That is probably all you need for a review, but that's not a review really. Anyways, if you don't know the plot of BioShock then you've been living under a rock for the past few months. You play a nobody named Jack who crashes in a plane and discovers Rapture: A failed underwater city who's founder, Andrew Ryan, turns crazy and all the people of Rapture have gone nuts. They goes nuts due to the plasmids they use to gain powers. Also, the ADAM that can make you turn into anything you want is very valuable and is the key to Rapture. The Little Sisters gather the ADAM and the Big Daddies protect them. The story is full of plot twists and secrets. It's probably one of the most original stories in any game period. The gameplay is like the average shooter if you want it to be or can it can be a genetically enhanced one. That's the beauty of BioShock. It can be anything you want it to be boring, fun, stupid, lame it's all up to you.The game's narrative is one-of-a-kind and what most games copy these days. The story is told through radio transmissions with no cut scenes. That is extremely hard to do while keeping the player interested. Atlas guides you around telling you how to get to Andrew Ryan, but the world around you also tells the story of Rapture through audio diaries, things written on walls, and what the psychotic enemies blurt out. This is a rare form of storytelling in games and is why BioShock is such a classic.The graphics stand up pretty well today with DirectX 10 enhancements, but they are so subtle you won't even notice. There is supposed to be better water effects and physics, but I didn't notice a difference except your steps cause ripples in water now. There are lots of graphical problems on the PC that were never addressed, but they don't hinder the game much. The game is very surreal and it just sucks you in. The big thing here is the gene splicing and all the plasmids. There are so many of them and you can do whatever you want with them. You can shoot fire from your hands or freeze your enemy with an ice blast. There are others as well that let you gain more health or hack turrets and safes better and faster. There is just so much detail here it's nuts. You can use a camera and research your enemies to learn their weakness and gain new plasmids and tonics. The only disappointment was the lack of any multiplayer what-so-ever. All you can do is play this game to experience the true beauty of it all. BioShock is one of best, games in years and I assure you will have more fun with BioShock than Halo 3 or Metroid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"A disappointment","reviewText":"I played this game at a friends house around the time it came out and I hated it. Years later, I find out they are coming out with a new GTA game so I decided to look into this game a little more. I didn't spend to much time playing this game at my friends house 4 years ago because of how bad the game is so since the game is only 20 bucks at decided to go more in depth.As I said in the description, this game is a disappointment. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking. The first 3 GTA games were very good, especially san andreas, but this one is wayyyy off.The controls are a little different even though you can go back to classic mode. Shooting seems a little more difficult and the cars handle HORRIBLY. That is probably the biggest problem with this game is the controls of the cars. The damage effects is nice and the cars no longer explode when flipped on their roofs. But the cars are difficult to control around corners. I hate the fact that you can't set the default to \"run\". You have to press and hold \"a\" in order for him to run and there is no way to change that.The graphics are not as good as they should be. The city is huge and has a lot of detail in it. The people reacts more life like in this game then in previous games and I like how some of the people can actually die in car accidents if their car gets hit hard enough. If it rains, you will see people running, some will have umbrellas, others newspapers. Thats a nice touch. You can do burn outs in cars and if you do them too long the tire will explode. You can still drive the car of course but it will make the cars more difficult to handle even though they are already difficult to handle. No more paramedic and firefigher missions. If you get a cop car, you can check the cars computer to see crimes in the area that you can take on.The acting is good in the game. Lots of cursing which I see is the norm in todays games. The movie scenes seem to be longer this time around too which I like. The missions are pretty repetitive though. You will probably get tired of this game before you even finish it. I actually have to use cheats to make the game more enjoyable for me. You die so easily in this game and body armor is hard to come by. I don't mind the character Niko.There really is no point in buying this game since part 5 is coming out soon. I just bought it cuz I had nothing else better to do. Hopefully it will be a 1000 times better then this junk. I am glad I only paid $20.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}

The people here are writing laughable reviews that try to turn the good things into bad. Everything in this game is done perfectly and it would take an idiot not to see that. It even got best game of the year on penny arcade. That is saying alot.You start out with a cutscene in CGI. One reviewer said it was all in &quot;real-time&quot; but thats not true. A lot of the cutscenes are in CGI and they are done spectacularly. There are a lot of interludes done in the games graphics that look spectacular also. As for the graphics in general, amazing. The areas are vast. You will encounter a lot of colorful scenery with well done badguys. The lighting is pretty well done as it fits the mood most of the time. The way the enemies glow when you hit them or when you hit a wall is perfectly done. Every time you hit something you know it had to hurt.As for the gameplay, it is extremely well done. This game is a platform game. Your dagger can rewind time. You need sand to do that. You will encounter tons of chances to get sand. Killing an enemy will get you sand. There are many other powers to get as well. Speed up, slow down, and freeze enemies. You also have a sword which helps you fight. When fighting it is also fun to counter enemies or jump off walls. You can block mostly anything and jump around the place to beat your enemies. It is fun. You don't need 500 moves to make the fighting fun in this game. You can also pull off different combos and finally finish off your enemy with your spectacular dagger.This is a platform game, yea. But the story works extremely well in my opinion. You go throughout the palace, on a linear but fun path, which will take you to your objective. Sometimes you will wind up where you started and go somewhere else from there after a cutscene.The platforming is done great. You jump, run, and dodge things. It is kind of like something Indiana Jones would do except you jump far, run fast, and dodge quickly. What I mean is, the Prince of Persia is awesome at working with platforms. Lara Croft often had you messing up because you had to hit jump perfectly or you would fall. In this game you can rewind time when you mess up which is rarely. It is so easy to hit the platforms but it looks hard at first. Jumping looks awesome because the Prince LUNGES at the other side and will usually grab onto the ledge. If you are running lets say and you don't see a pit coming up? Prince of Persia doesn't EVER run off of platforms. He will always grab onto the edge. If you hit A you can jump up or X you can fall down. This makes the platforms unfrustrating because it is harder to die. There is nothing frustrating. If you DO mess up by running out of sand which you shouldn't, you can retry from the beggining of the puzzel which doesn't take long at all.This game was done beautifully. Even the camera doesn't affect this platform game at all. You will never die because of the camera. Not one thing in this game pisses me off. This is the definition of a great game. In a year with so many games, I think this may be the best one ive played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}

There are a decent amount of achievements you'll get, and there is also some downloadable content available, though I recommend avoiding it because the game plays well as it is (plus guns and armor don't seem worth the MS points). The graphics and sound are perfect and the lack of a true HUD makes it feel like you are playing a movie at times. The boss fights are challenging but not too hard. The zero gravity and no pressurization zones are fun and there are a few mini games as well. There were a few difficult spots but nothing too crazy. My only complaint is that a few parts got tedious and the turret chair scenes were kind of annoying, though they they don't  really take away from the overall experience. You'll definitely want to beat it to see how it all plays out. For the price and quality of this game I would say it is a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

This game is innovative, a venture into the new world.  It brings video gaming to the next level.  I will admit, this game was creative, the concept is pretty good, and at times it can be fun.  But the overall gameplay is just a bit too gory for my taste.  Here's what I thought after a few hours of GTA3:1. The graphics: pretty good.  I disagree with anyone who said this game lacked graphics.  I own an XBOX and hate PS2's graphics, but I was impressed by the many things this game supports.  There are dozens of cars, bridges, people, shops, trees, guns, and just about everything else.  The world looks real and comes alive!  The weather changes, and the worlds are HUGE!  As much as I hated all the gore, this game definantly looked pretty awsome in every other way.  Grade: B+2. The gameplay: ok...if u like going around shooting people to death.  There's way to much blood, and the way u can just keep hitting people again and again with the bat or the gun just gets sickening.  The blood is everywhere, and it really takes the quote \"Fun\" out of the game.  The whole concept of hejacking cars is cool, and swithcing cars again and again or running on foot was pretty cool (while trying to escape the police).  You can hejack anything from regular old jeeps to Taxi's, Police Cars, Ambulances, Fire Trucks, Vipers, Tanks, and anything else out there.  Once again, all this would have been fun, even shooting people...without the gore.  This game could have been so much more, but instead, it's just sickening.  Gangs are everywhere, FREEDOM is everything.  But overall, I just didn't find it fun, in fact quite the opposite.  Grade: C-3. Replay value: I can see how an extreme person might like this game, and if u can handle shooting people's head off to see a fountain of blood, go ahead.  But overall, the game made me feel like a criminal, nothing else.  But if u do like this kind of game, there are dozens of missions, freedom beyond your largest dreams, and cash to earn.  Rival gangs and kick police ....  The concept was awsome...it just didn't click for me.  Grade: B-Well, I hope this helped, and if your sickened by gore like me, you probably won't like this game.  A sour feeling left in my mouth, I will never be a GTA fan, and could care less if one of them makes there way on to the XBOX.  My friend likes it, he can like it.  It justn't didn't click with me.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"cplowens0331","summary":"WTF!  Ruins the entire franchise.","reviewText":"Aside from the hugely disappointing ending that changes colors. This game is trash compared to the first two.  The journal in this one is a major step backwards from 2. Your choices from the two prior do not impact any major parts of the game(just like in 2), it was like hey thanks for saving me see you later. !!!!!spoiler!!!!! The mission on Tuchanka where you face the rachni queen. In the original you had the choice of killing the queen or sparing her but no matter what decision you made a rachni queen still appears.At the end of me2 you have the choice of 'destroying' the human reaper or handing it over to cerberus but not matter what you do it still appears in ME3 on the level with kei leng. The option of rewriting or destroying the geth in 2 is pointless because you have to rewrite them again in 3. The game is full of events and missions where your choices become obsolete. The whole concept of overhearing pedestrians in order to bring up a mission to scan a planet for 'war assets'. Bioware couldn't make some of those be actual missions. The day one dlc is probably the biggest rip off in the history of gaming considering the hype that this game had before release. Bioware knew they could made a few more million off of gamers by not adding it in to begin with since it did get delayed an extra 2 and a half months. The extra character doesn't really add anything to the story other than when you go to the asari homeworld and find out the gods they worshipped were just the protheans.  Somehow the collectors, who were the main enemy from 2, were big during the prothean era but werent even mentioned during me1. The melee attack is half assed. Vega is useless and what happened to all the characters from 2. All of a sudden they cant join with you for some bs reason. Joker falls in love with EDI the AI.  Half assed story that I wouldnt believe if my life depended on it. Somehow people can still be petty when faced with extinction. Reapers are all of a sudden weaker unlike in me1 when Sovereign easily took out half the fleet fighting it. It was said that 1 reaper could take out an entire planet yet somehow humanity is putting up a great fight against hundreds if not thousands of them.  Why do reapers need ground forces? Why is humanity such a major threat to the reapers? is shepard that much of a bamf that they have to take out all humans first?  the scanning of a system get annoying when you have to constantly run from reapers after 2 scans.  Bioware makes you feel left out if you didnt romance Liara in 1 by making ashley/kaiden romance subpar and me2 romance obsolete. Apparently everyone overlooked a person still living on eden prime that wasnt human(the dlc character). this is the smallest complaint i have but i hate it when you refer to marines as soldier and completely jack up the rank structure. soldier, sailor, airman, marine. each branch has is on rank structure do some research Bioware, activision did it with Call of duty 4. The sole purpose of me2 was to introduce the illusive man because Cerberus plays such a huge role in 3 which is another thing that every gamer overlooks. why the hell is Cerberus going gainst everything cmdr shepard does like trying to prevent the fertile female krogan from going back to the krogan. why did bioware have to add multiplayer to an already working franchise. if it isnt broke dont fix it. All multiplayer really is is a cheap knockoff of gears of war horde mode with horrible controls. once you complete a mission on a planet you can not revisit it. the glitches are annoying but arent too bad but when compared to me2 its bad. now the ending, how in any way is this a good ending. you screw over the entire galaxy. regardless of what bioware says and i have the guide to prove what they claim there is only 1 ending with 3 different color: red green blue. There are not 16 endings just one. same cut scenes after you 'make your final choice' just very very slightly adjusted depending on  if you merge control or destroy the reapers. not the epic ending we were promised.Worst ending in gaming history. Major plot holes. Limited party members. Completely ubsurb story (all you have to do is think about it a little people). do not but this game it will ruin the first 2. it did for me. i traded in all 3 for 360 all of which were collectors editions and 2 for ps3, me3 was a collectors edition. i even gave away all the comic book tie ins because the last 1k hours of gameplay was just a waste of timei have a feeling some people are going to get all butt hurt bc they arent unbiased  to see all the fault with this game and will take this personally.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2012"}

If you prefer role playing games and more adventure oriented titles (even though Dreamcast does have a few good ones), you may want to get Playstation 2 as it offers more variety in that catagory.  The only bad feature about the Dreamcast is the controllers...they break down often, especially if you constantly play Capcom's 2D fighters. Plus, I think it was a bad idea to make the VMU slots on the controllers rather than on the system itself, it just seems awkward.  As for the durability issue, I can't really speak for that yet.  What I can tell you is that I have had mine for well over a year now, it has endured extensive play, and has yet to display any noticable overheating/overuse problems.

S.T.A.R.S (special tactics and rescue service) teams are dispatched to the Arklay Mountains outside Raccoon city where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. Bravo team goes first but their helicopter crashes and the team ends up dead or missing (see Resident Evil 0 for their story). Alpha team is then dispatched to find out what happened to Bravo team. As they discover the crashed helicopter, mutant dogs attack and the team flees into a nearby mansion that they thought was deserted. They thought wrong....Gameplay: Dubbed as one of the first survivor horror games. Single-player. You take control of either S.T.A.R.S member Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield. You have a few support characters (Rebecca Chambers from RE0 if playing as Chris, or Barry Burton if playing as Jill). The support characters help you along the way. You search the mansion from room to room trying to unravel the mystery and get to new areas. Doors are locked and there are several puzzles you need to solve in order to get keys and special objects. You face multiple enemies in the game including zombies, artificial creatures called hunters and chimeras, mutant dogs and crows, giant spiders, sharks, as well as boss creatures. You have limited carrying capability so the game uses a storage box that is accessible in multiple locations. You inventory contains your weapons, ammo, first aid, objects and keys, ink ribbons, etc. so deciding what to carry with you is tricky. You need the ink ribbons to save your game and there is a limited number, same with ammo for your weapons. Your weapons include pistols, magnums, shotguns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, close combat knives, etc.Conclusion: Controls have never been better, movement is more fluid, and the sound and graphics are the best version yet. The gameplay is longer than previous versions and replaying the game as the different characters is a bonus as the story and walkthrough varies between characters. If you played any of the original versions, don't worry as the scary elements of the game are still there and some new ones have been added. IGN ranked this game as the 13th best game on the GameCube on their top 25 list. Only Resident Evil 4 beat this game in the series ranking on the GameCube (it was ranked #2 of the top 25). Worth getting if you still own a GameCube or it will play on the Wii with a GameCube controller and memory card. This one will stay in my collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

It was fun and addicting. Its weapons were great.I wish the creators had kept the weapons and their functionality. Plus, this game is buggy. Even after the 1.5 upgrade, the weapons don't change properly and some of the chapters have issues (doors don't open when they should etc).This isn't a bad game. It is a very average game.I've never played Resistence 2. But if that game is worse than this, then Resistence 2 must be a downer indeed.Maybe I had high expectations.

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"This is what happens when you listen to the fans","reviewText":"Did you want better graphics? Did you want a better shooter interface? Well, Bioware delivered...no question.So Bioware has made a lot of changes to the game (too many to count perhaps), but one things for sure, they created a winner.NEW COMBAT SYSTEM:Much more like a first person shooter now; defiantly fun to shoot people and pop the head off of someone. Also doesn't matter as much what abilities you upgrade or what weapons you have; if you can aim then you can kill a bad guy.NEW UPGRADE SYSTEM:Can't really decide if I like this or not. There's a part of me that enjoys how much simpler everything has become and how much time I save, but I think I kind of enjoyed the in depth upgrade and weapons in the first game. This opinion may or may not be shared. Regardless, I was a little to overwhelmed by the greatness of this game to care that much.INTERFACE WITH PREVIOUS GAME:You'll hear little reminents of things you did in the past and you'll definitely get the feel that you had an impact, but it's not as dramatic I had expected. They hyped it up so much that your last game would have such a big impact on this one, but I haven't seen much to back that up. I was a level 55 in the first game so I got to start a few levels up in this one and they gave me a little extra cash for being rich in ME1, but it wasn't that significant. Guess I just expected a little bit more, but I have to admit that any interface with the previous game must have been hard and it's groundbreaking, so they get my respect.HACKING/CODE BREAKING: The new system they designed for unlocking items and hacking systems is a lot more fun. Actually feels a little bit challenging and regardless of your level or path you've chosen, you'll be able to do it.VEHICLE: Good news! There really isn't a vehicle; you'll pick where you want to go and then you'll go there. The vehicle from ME1 felt like a shopping cart with one bad wheel to me and I'm glad to see it's gone.PLANET EXPLORATION: Pretty cool system they came up with. You'll use a radar device to explore a planets surface and then deploy pods to check for what you're looking for. This is a much improved system from just driving around in my opinion. Be ready to spend a lot of hours looking around. There's an amazing amount of land to cover in the universe. They really worked hard to give you a lot to explore and it shows. Doesn't have that empty pointless feeling that the first ME had when I was checking planets. If they weren't related to the primary objective, every planet felt the sameTHE GOOD:1) Story is great and managed to integrate with the first game to include your actions taken2) Graphics are on par with competitive titles from this gen; really stunning to just look around at your surroundings3) Lots of glitches fixed and too many improvements to count; some things they did were almost to small to even notice, but you can feel they're thereTHE BAD:1) New dumbed down RPG elements feel easy to use but a little empty. If you hated the monotony of upgrading too many small aspects and customizing every weapon for proper ammo and best fit then maybe you'll like it. But, I couldn't help but feel that it was a little bit too easy and boring compared to the first game2) You'll have to do a long mission to gain the loyalty of every one of your 10 squad members; it's kind of cool at first, but it gets a little old. Really? I have to complete a mission to get Garus on my side? Pretty sure I proved my loyalty fighting the Geth and Saren already3) The new planet scanning system is cool and I'm glad to be rid of the vehicle, but it starts to get really old searching for minerals. After about 4 hours of it I got tired and decided I had enough uprades. Searched about 60 planets and found 6 side missions, so that feels like there's probably a lot out there. I didn't make it to level 30 so I must have missed a lot, but I just got so sick of scanning planets. Not a big complaint though; I don't know how they could have done it better so I was pleased.OVERVIEW:GRAPHICS: 10/10DIALOGUE: 10/10AUDIO: 10/10COMBAT SYSTEM: 10/10UPGRADES: 8/10STORY: 10/10INTEGRATION OF PREVIOUS GAME: 7/10Whether you liked the first ME or you didn't, this game is a winner. I have my share of complaints, but the game is an amazing edition to the trilogy and you can just sense the effort Bioware put into this. Everyone will have complaints, but I've never seen a developer listen to the feedback and put forth this much effort.Two days ago I would have told you ME1 was almost perfect, but this game has shown be the light and really set the bar.Thanks BiowareGood Gaming","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Rotten cheese, you do realize that this is not Azeroth?  There aren't any level 1 starting zones in Outland so why would there be Alliance/Horde territories?  You think alliance would totally be in control of Hellfire penninsula? Umm...it's littered with orcs and the like.  Anyways, it IS just like Azeroth in the sense that every level 60+ area is contested so DEAL WITH IT.  Nothing has changed there so I have no clue what you are complaining about.  By the way, you will only get ganked if you are on a PVP server.The first day I played this on my PVP realm, the Horde and Alliance were more interested in leveling than wasting time and killing eachother.  That would be complete chaos caused by real players.  There is occasional ganking but now that people are leveling up again the population is spreading out nicely throughout Outland.I have yet to run into one bugged quest.  Sure, spawn rates are rediculously fast in some places but come on, there are 40 players runnin around killin the same stuff.  Good job on Blizzard's part to increase spawn rates this time for the starting quests in Hellfire Peninsula.There are so many more items added to this expansion to drown you in.  Some greens/blues are better than the lvl 60 epic set items that were in the original game.  Now people who couldn't raid before can actually get very nice gear from the new dungeons.  Another good job from Blizzard to help the casual gamer.I haven't played either of the 2 new races so I won't comment on those.The last couple things are the music and the scenery.  The music is fantastic, from the opening title screen to every zone track in Outland.  The voice acting of the bosses is pretty cool too.  I hear the Blood Elf jokes are extremely gay though.  The scenery of every zone of Outland is so colorful it looks 10 times better then anything in Azeroth.  Even the new mobs all around are more detailed and have more color and thought put into them.  From armored voidwalkers in Hellfire Peninsula to nasty creatures that look like that came out of War of the Worlds or something, this game has it all.This expansion has everything we could have ever wanted in one from Blizzard.  I'm sure this one will last another 2 years before the next expansion.  Go get your copy NOW.  You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"The Frequency is set to Amazing","reviewText":"First off, I want to say that I was not interesting in the WaveBird when I first heard about it.  I am a big fan of the rumble feature that seems to be standard now in all the company's controllers that plug into the systems.Also I have never really been impressed with the whole wireless controller thing.  Sure it was a neat idea when it was out on the Genesis and other systems, but up until the WaveBird, most, if not all, the wireless controllers have been infrared.  Which meant you had to point the controller directly at the sensor on the console and hope no one steps in front of you and blocks your signal for that moment.  Again, the idea was neat, but in reality the wireless controllers weren't all that good.So to me the WaveBird was just another wireless controller in the long continuing line of them.  Just another neat idea that I didn't really want.But thanks goodness I was with my friend when we both found the WaveBird in the store.  I had been reading from people on Amazon how good the WaveBird was in reality, so my lack of desire to own one was lessening.  Sure I still didn't like the fact that the rumble feature was not present in the WaveBird, but the songs of praise people were singing it, started to make it a bit tempting to me.  So my friend and I decided to each get one at the same time when we found it.I was amazed at what it could do!  Since it runs off of radio waves and not the infrared of the old wireless controllers, there is a lot more you can do with it.  For one, it can pick up the signal from quite a distance away.  And gone from the infrared is the problem of making sure you are pointing your controller directly at the sensor on the console.  Heck I walked out of my room, behind a wall and in the kitchen and I could still control the game.  What a great idea Nintendo had when they decided to go with radio waves and drop the infrared junk!The WaveBird has changed my mind on wireless controllers.  I personally am very impressed with what Nintendo has offered here and think that it would be a good addition to anyone's GameCube, unless you already have 4 controllers that is and don't sit too far away from your console.  I like the fact that I can just relax and point the controller any way I want and it still responds as if I was using a controller that was plugged in.  That's another thing that is so impressive about the WaveBird.  Its response time seems just as good as the normal controller to me.I still wish it had the rumble feature, but I can understand why Nintendo didn't include it.  It would have greatly decreased the life of the batteries.  But this controller has impressed me so much, that I actually didn't mind as much as I would have thought, that the rumble feature was not there.I really have nothing but great things to say about the WaveBird and by looking at the ratings it's gotten here, neither do many others.  I just don't really see how you could go wrong with picking up a WaveBird if you need or want an extra controller, and it's not expensive at all.  Nintendo really came out with a great product here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2002"}

The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"Peace Daddy \"Eclectic ReflectionZ\"","summary":"Fantastic fun for kids.","reviewText":"I have to say that my children, ages 11 and 7, have both thoroughly enjoyed this game. So much so that we've already bought 3 of the additional characters, which by the way have been so popular that they've been sold out since shortly after Christmas in many places. I guess that's the only thing I really don't like about the game: the fact that it's so expensive if you want the full experience with all of the characters and extra worlds. I still can't knock it too much for that because each character does add its own unique dimension to the game, but it is an understandable gripe.I won't get too deep into explaining the gameplay and elements because this information is common knowledge. I will say that even if you don't purchase any of the add-ons, you can still get a worthwhile game experience with just the base game and the 3 characters that are included with it. It kept my kids thoroughly entertained for weeks before they asked for more characters. Also, if you replay the game with the additional characters you get a different experience and run into different things, so this also adds value to the character add-ons.We still haven't purchased any of the area add-ons, but my kids want the Pirate Seas add-on so we'll probably get that first. All told, you could easily spend a few hundred dollars on just the add-ons for this game. While I don't know if we'll get every one, the ones we've purchased so far (Sonic Boom, Prism Break & Cynder) have been worth the money spent. Whether you choose to buy the add-ons for the game or not, Skylanders Spyro's Adventure is definitely a recommended purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"TheRumblePack.com","summary":"Mass Effect might not look as pretty anymore, but she still runs just fine","reviewText":"A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away, BioWare, the legendary creators of Dragon Age and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, gave gamers their first epic, multi-pathed Xbox 360 RPG with Mass Effect. Released to much fan-fare, the heralded action-rpg hybrid allowed players to guide their own customized main character (Commander Shepard) and his recruitable, multi-species crew through a sci-fi journey of galactic proportions - literally. Fast forward to present-day Earth - while the masses are once again waiting to be affected by the sequel, a select few of us that missed out on the first portion of the story (or simply want our in-game decisions to carry over to the successor) have decided to go back and try to save the original galaxy again before the day of second impact. Fortunately, while some of the creaks and cracks of yesteryear have fissured into eye sores since its original release, the old girl has still largely \"got it where it counts.\"Let's start with the probably the best reason to play through the original game again: the highly shapeable story and the dialogue system on which it rests. Although BioWare fans will recognize this as the company's MO, nearly every conversation and decision within  Mass Effect allows the player to select responses that lead to major and minor consequences. Depending on whether you react to a situation with a cool-headed and diplomatic \"Paragon\" response or a hot-headed and likely more risky \"Renegade\" option (or anything in between), NPCs will come to either respect you or hate your guts, open up to you or shut you out, or ultimately be allowed to live or suffer a gruesome death. Although not every detail of Commander Shepard's adventures will be changed via this system - you'll still fight the same bosses, still be able to access the same shops and still have the same amount of selectable missions - it's these major choices that the player is forced to make that have become Mass Effect's true legacy. I won't sugarcoat the situation - some of the decisions can be quite difficult, but that only reinforces the success that BioWare has had in helping players establish meaningful connections to their in-game crew and support characters. Their fate is quite literally in your controller-greased hands.But while you'll delight in seeing the fruits of your dialogue-based decisions, chances are that the combat won't live up to your modern-day expectations. Battles are carried out through a behind the shoulder, third-person perspective, with Shepard leading two of his fellow squadmates, all with different traits and abilities (of course) into a cover-based shooter against armies of robots, mercenaries and nogoodniks. Each character has an assortment of different guns and special abilities that allow for an amusing combination of battle tactics at your disposal - you can suspend enemies in mid-air, overload their weapons and disable their shields, all before they hit the ground. Unfortunately, the cover system, in which you try to stick as close to a wall as possible in hopes of automatically latching onto it, can only be described as serviceable at best, especially with other third-person shooters such as Gears of War setting a high bar over the past few years. And while certain character classes, such as the Soldier or Vanguard, will have little trouble disposing of the legions of seemingly crack-shot enemies despite this flawed mechanic, others will be doomed to restarting the same battles multiple times due to an over-exposed limb. Add to this a fairly crude checkpoint system, and you could find yourself repeating the same 20 minute battle over and over again, complete with unskippable cutscenes and loss of saved player settings. Suffice to say, your learning curve may vary.It's also surprising - again, given its release - how well Mass Effect's graphics still hold up. While it certainly doesn't represent the bleeding-edge of textures and polygons that it once was, there are still quite a few awe-inspiring moments to be found within the galaxy - especially during the last few missions. And although some may blame unsynchronized voices and mouth movements on a general lack of polish (and they might be right), I find myself more willing to stick the rather uninspired side-missions and exploration quests into that unfortunate possibility bucket. No matter what the task might be, whether it's to rescue a sibling, purchase a certain good or procure information for someone, everything revolves around either too lengthy, although admittedly well-done, conversations or raids on generic buildings, wiping out baddies for cash that's all but worthless. With nearly every worthwhile weapon and piece of armor procured through chests along the main story arc, there's even less reason to explore the dozens of additional planets littered throughout the galaxy, most of them empty wastelands that contain some sort of mineral or artifact, good only for cash or obsessive collection relief.But despite the janky, unbalanced combat, the slightly outdated visuals and the largely uninteresting side-quests, Mass Effect still manages to win over the majority of players through its thoroughly engaging story and dialogue system. It's proof-positive that giving players a greater array of choices within their game will allow them to connect more strongly to it, especially if the consequences are interesting, heartfelt and permanent. It's very little wonder why fans are excited for the sequel - we want to see how our actions will continue to affect all of our stories, lack of polish be damned. But while the new model is right around the corner, don't hesitate to take the ol' gal out for a ride if you're interested. She might not look as pretty anymore, but she still runs just fine.--Reviewed by Nicolo Accordino","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"A striking milestone of a game (with spoilers)","reviewText":"When I first played the original Silent Hill for PS one, I thought that it was a very engrossing and scary game, and overall, very well made.  At that point in my life I was in high school, and while I enjoyed it I didn't appreciate then as much as I do now; you might notice that my old Silent Hill (PSone) review was cheesy.  I agree, because while it is a very f'ed up game, it also has a lot of heart and symbolic meaning behind it.  In other words, it's also a work of art, not just a game to blow your mind away and eat your soul.  When Silent Hill 2 came out, I have to admit that I was met with some rejection feelings because it didn't really connect with the first game... I've noticed this among many of my friends, however, I had to give this game a chance.  And after all was said and done, this remains so far as my favorite Silent Hill game.This game stars James Sunderland, who returns to Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his already deceased wife Mary to \"return to their special place.\"  Through the course of the story, he meets other strange characters: Angela, who's returned to find her family and has an unfortunate past in regards to her father; Eddie, who only says that he was called there but soon turns insane and realizes he has the right to kill people; Laura, a girl who apparently was close to Mary in the hospital; and finally, Maria, a carbon-copy of his late wife Mary, only Maria is dressed provocatively different.We are introduced to new monsters in the game; the nurses look ten times freakier with bandages over their faces and creepy noises (unlike the silly groans and the humps in the first game).  There are patient demons that run around like they're totally restrained and spit acid blood.  Mannequins run around with legs for arms and attempt to bash them against you.  And of course, I cannot mention this game without the infamous Pyramid Head, in which there are actually two that are after you.While Silent Hill's story centered on a demigod coming back to life using a child's power and lifeforce, Silent Hill 2 is all centered around redemption and the history of the town itself; We learn that the town was ALREADY screwed up before Dahlia and the cult decided to play god and bring about the darkness in the first game.  During the civil war, they had imprisoned soldiers and tortured them to death.  There were witch trials.  There was lots of crime, including the character of Walter Sullivan killing children (sound familiar?  He's the main villain in Silent Hill 4!).  Now the once-used prison is the historical society.  Pyramid Head apparently was around during that time, or at least is a representation of the two cloaked executioners who supervised the deaths.And the reason I point out \"Redemption\" is because all of the characters---including the main character---have committed some awful sin and have been called back to Silent Hill to pay for their sins.  Eddie was a fat guy that was made fun of all the time, and instead of moving on with life, he gets called back to Silent Hill and develops the desire and the thrill of killing.  Angela's family past has come back to haunt her and instead of reconciling with her family (or moving on), she decides to kill herself.  James, the main character, killed his wife (or did he?) and thus returned for judgment, and depending on what ending you get, he either leaves with the innocent Laura (who doesn't see monsters at all) and takes care of her as Mary requested or else faces the consequences by either going through that again with the Maria character or also committing suicide (we are also left with the indication that it was 3 days or 3 weeks as opposed to 3 years since Mary's passing).  There are other endings as well, which I'll leave you to find out what.A very atmospheric game with the most human story of the Silent Hill series; With smoother gameplay, better graphics (thereby allowing for more scary aesthetics), and an engrossing story, this game paved the way for Silent Hill 4's creepy tale as well.  Out of all the Silent Hill games, this one captivated me the most and made me want to play it over and over again.  I read an article once that said that the creators' favorite one was this one... I can see why, because despite all of the aberrations and hellish environments, this one's a human game at its core.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"And I thought it was going to be good...","reviewText":"This is it!  Is this what the hype was all about? Totally disappointed with this game. Again, a game that took 3 years to develop isnt a guarantee that it'll be good (Daikatana anyone?). Diablo 2 is just all hot air. Lets start with the bugs. First of, let's start with the technical goof ups. The  game had problems with some CD drives. It takes me 3 to 5 tries just to  have my Creative DVD recognize the CD. This is a major bug. Second, the CD  had problems ejecting from my drive, thanks to the patch they released  v.1.02, it still didnt fix it. Thanks for nothing Blizzard. Third, the game  wont run on my GeforceDDR under Direct 3D. So now, Im running the game  using DirectDraw from my GeforceDDR. I ran the game using 3dfx glide and  the graphics were so washed out and hazy. What do you expect from glide?  Now let's go with the gameplay. It is absolutely similar with the first  Diablo. Sure they upgraded the graphics and all, but gameplay is still the  same old Diablo. The game comes in 3 CDs. The first CD will take you only  about 4 hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too  easy to beat. You'll have the case of BOREDOM by the time you finish CD1.  As you progress deeper into the game, you start to realize that the  challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid [good money]  for it rather than seeing the end of the game. Motivation factor is zero.  There were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old Diablo but  new items and new weapons just isnt enough to save this game. Maps are 3  times bigger than the old Diablo. Other than that, this game is just a  waste of time because it runs and feels like the old Diablo which is  already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on. I enjoyed playing  Nox more than Diablo II. Newcomers in the Diablo world will feel just dandy  with this game. Old Diablo players will go ho-hum with this one. My take on  this game, wait for the retailers to put it on the bargain shelves.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2000"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

There are many areas that GBASP excels in and only one where there is a trade-off (i.e., no negatives).Lighting. When we first got the GBA, we immediately had to get a good light to mount on it (80% of the ones on the market were hardly usable). Even then, it was difficult to see in some situations. Not to mention all the batteries were burned through with the add-on light. With GBASP, that is history. You can turn off the light, but you may find that you leave it on all the time. The lighting is obviously good in the dark, but it works impressively well in daylight (e.g., in the bright sun at 2pm at an open baseball stadium). This also makes the GBASP \"cheaper\" because you do not have to buy additional lighting units.Batteries. Since the GBASP uses an internal rechargeable battery, no more batteries to replace! There are adapters for car usage and the charge lasts quite a while, so not as big an issue as it may seem. Of course, not having heavy AA batteries also makes it smaller and lighter, not to mention cheaper. We figure that batteries alone will give a full pay-back of the unit within the first year.Weight. The GBASP is lighter than GBA and easy to notice the difference. A lot of this is due to using a lightweight rechargeable battery instead of heavy AA batteries. Also, the form factor lends itself to lighter weight by better use of space.Size. The size is great. Since it collapses and use space more efficiently, it easy fits in pants pockets and is more resistant to banging (the buttons end up being protected). Since the edges are smooth and flat, it also makes it easier to pack.Compatibility. Of course, the GBASP will play all GBA games and games that the GBA could play. This is always a big deal and this handles it well. The GBC cartridges stick out slightly (the GBA games are flush with the unit), but not more so than with the GBA unit itself.Sound. Although the sound may not be as loud as the GBA, this is often welcomed -- both for less power consumption and for less annoyance to others in the area who may not want to hear it (it does have an earphone jack).Overall, this is a big winner. It is no surprise that every toy store in this area is sold out of them. The only way we got one was because we bought it as a package that include a game that many people already have.

Contrary to some of these posts, the game is not difficult or tricky - just tedious. For instance, approaching my first Cyclops (and they are relatively weak and slow), notice that there is path too narrow for him to follow from which I can use ranged attack and a big rock that I can run around in order to take the battle closer in and still avoid the one hit instant death scenario. Then notice that he has a full heath bar with two dots above it. This means that you have to kill him three times over - each time you kill him another dot disappears, whatever?! So my companions (pawns) run up and get killed immediately while I send over largely ineffective arrows. I might as well be hitting this guy with a wet noodle. Fast forward two hours (most big fights take about 2 hours), I've got the Cyclops down to nothing from running around reviving my pawns and doing the most repetitive exercise of my entire life. He finally falls like a tree and drops some junk that I will probably never use and respawns the next time that I reload the game. Was that rewarding? Was that fun?Update - am now playing through a New Game+, this is a reload of a character who completed the game. I am sick of inventory management and quests that have nothing to do with anything (bring some guy an herb beer). Combat is a button mashing nightmare and my dagger attacks keep ending with me facing the wrong way, pawns have zero AI - very lucky when a coordinated attack happens. For instance, try telling your pawns to target the goat head on the Black Chimera or we will be here another hour while it regenerates itself.

Emerge from the tiniest of villages into a sweeping tale of danger and war, chronicling your rise from a peasant to a full-fledged hero of the Realms. The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Acoma","summary":"Neverwinter Nights 2...","reviewText":"Neverwinter Nights 2 is the sequel to the popular Neverwinter Nights.  How does it hold up to its predecessor? Well, if you are looking for upgraded graphics, a new user interface and new \"bling\" then it is probably what you were waiting for.First off, let me state that Neverwinter Nights 2 is NOT a game that caters to the console crowd. It is not a \"hack and slash\" nor is it an adventure game like The Longest Journey or Syberia.  It is a PC Role-Playing Game designed specifically for PC gamers which happens to appeal to me.  You cannot quickly run through killing hordes of monsters nor are the quests \"smash and grab\" oriented.I found it most refreshing that the RPG elements were presented in a KOTORish type of environment. That is, when you are in a dialogue with important NPCs the setting changes that promotes dialogue, choice and interaction which delivers a good immersion value.Is this game for everyone? No, fans of Diablo, Dungeon Seige or FPS will probably not get into this game. Fans of the original Neverwinter Nights will because it stays fairly true to the premise of the original. It delivers a solid single-player expierience with robust tools to create your own campaign settings, bringing Neverwinter Nights into the next techno-gadget environment.  If you were thrilled by Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and the simplicity and speed with which you can run through everything then you probably will need to switch gears to come down to a slow paced true PC RPG and not a hybrid like Oblivion (Designed for the console and PC).However, there are problems.  From the NWN Vault boards, among others, there are postings of technical problems abound. Personally, I have not expierienced any using a Pentium IV 3.4, 6800 GT video card with 1gig of DDR RAM.  This is not to discount problems others are having, but some solutions might be to ensure you have the latest drivers. I am not the smartest guy when it comes to computers, but when I updated my sound, video drivers I noticed a marked improvement in all my games including Neverwinter Nights 2.  The system requirements are a bit steep, but if you are serious about PC gaming then you need to have money to spend.  If not, the consoles are relatively cheap, although you have to like the console environment over the PC one.The story starts out fairly standard for a RPG, you are the adopted son of a prominent member of a villiage and encounter various hardships that lead you up to becoming the big hero of the day.  It does not feel bland at all, the voice acting is well done and the story flows fairly smoothly. I especially like the KOTORish interaction in the dialogue.I have found no significant bugs that have been a game-killer for me. Is there items that need to be improved upon? Yes, an excellent posting on the main NWN site lists 101 things that can be improved in NWN 2. The moderators are responsive, and based upon their historical patterns of replying and fixing/moding areas that gamers want improved...well, patches will be coming.Already I've downloaded several patches from the Update link, one of which was pretty extensive. The customer support is there, and that is definately a good thing. Should games come ready to play out of the box? Oh yeah, but the reality is with complex games (like RPGS) that it doesnt, as long as the techinical support is there then my money was well spent. Overall a 4-star game.Pros:- Improved graphics over the original- Good voice acting- Excellent dialogue- Fun gameplay (If you like PC RPGs)- Great tutorialCons:- Camera controls aren't user-friendly- UI needs to be revamped (Particulary the SHIFT-Right click when interacting with objects)- Game can stutter even on high end gaming rigs.- Too many users expieriencing techinal difficulties. These need to be addressed so everyone can enjoy the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2006"}

Prince of Persia is not a hack and slash game, it's not a fighting game, it's not even really a platform game.  The best way to describe it is is as a adventure puzzle game, similar to Ico.Prince of Persia takes place in a huge palace, with many different levels.  In fact, there are so many levels, progress is defined by percent, not level number.  You control the Prince as he has to traverse the Palace.  This palace is magnificent, and the atmosphere of the palace really shines.  That alone is worth the price of the game.  A lot of thought and artistic integrity was invested in this palace.The Prince has to go through this palace while fighting monsters, which are pretty easy, while jumping, crawling, swinging, or moving objects his way out.  That's the beauty of it.  The movements to the next levels are the puzzle.  It's worth noting that these puzzles are not random, boring search and try puzzle like in Silent Hill or Kings Quest.  It's more of, \"how can I get to that wall?\", or \"how can push that button?\".  The puzzle take thought, but there never random, off the wall puzzles (like spending hours trying to find a key or some other stuff like that).Movement itself is a complete joy.  Except for wall to wall jumps, movements don't require exact button pushing mechanics or precision timing.  If you're on an overhang, and you need to jump to the next ledge, you just press x, and he'll jump and make it if you're aligned correctly.  You can jump from wall to wall, jump up, jump down, run along wall, since, balance, crawl, and hang, and much more.  If you do make a mistake, you've got the option of rewinding time, which means that you rarely repeat the same level over and over again.  This means that the 12 hours to complete this is about 10 hours of real gameplay.  Not like other games where 20 hours of gameplay is really just 5 hours extended over a long period of time through repetitive monsters or jumps, backtracking, or repeating levels.The fights are pretty easy, but they are decent nonetheless.  It's good to know that they didn't make it overly hard or pointless.Somethings did bug me.  Sometimes the camera angle is not the best.  Sometimes you have to guess whether you can actually make a jump or not, or whether a ledge is there, and that could get annoying.  Also, one level in particular near the end is very unintuitive.  For some reason they take away your time reversal, they made the level really long, and the end of that level was very unintuitive and clumsy.  That five minutes of gameplay took an agonizing hour and a half.My other gripe are with the cut-scenes.  For some idiotic reason, they decided to make the dialogue volume really low and the background noise extremely high, thus making the vocals unintelligible.  I couldn't understand half of what was going on.  Worst part is - no subtitles.  It's extremely terrible since any major game should catch such a bug, and the fix is really easy.  I guess they designed it for televisions with high wattage Dolby surround, as opposed to normal televisions.Pros:No cheats, guides needed - just thought and common senseAtmosphere is amazingIntuitiveTime reverse helps avoid repetitionGreat flowGood balanceImmense palaceCons:Some moves are clumsy - wall to wall jumps for exampleVocals in cut-scenes are way too softDifficulty - EasyFrustration Level - LowTime to Complete: 12 hours","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2003"}

I've noticed some good things and bad things. The campaign is as I said nothing special. Seems pathetic compared to ROC. They couldn't even work in the orcs, so they made them a \"bonus\" campaign, which involves you do some boring tasks, than ends. People say later you download more, but thats just a rumor. Anyways, the problem isnt building. There are 2 types of missions. Get a hero, fight to the exit, while rescuing units of yours who for some reason still have their weapons even when in jail. Theres also get a half built base, upgrade your townhall or tree or whatever, than attack. Most missions are so easy to complete with the starting units you are given. The real problem is the characters. There are no backgrounds to any character or development. Maiev wants revenge over some dead guards so she hunts illidan, that is her ENTIRE story. You never learn anything else about her, except she has some real problems with being nice. Kael hungers for magic, which is stupid. Arthas is boring, wants to get his power back, and help the king of liches. Pretty boring. Then theres the crypt lord, ana'narub. He says \"I was sent to aid you from the lich king\" and bam thats it. You never learn anything about him. He is so boring. Then once you finish campaigns there is NO ending, and you learn what happens to NONE of the characters except one. Yes you have to wait for a new game because there was no ending really. It never says \"Kael decided to eat, so he stopped being hungry\". It says nothing about any of those characters.Battle.net seems to be boring. Every game is usually a rush now. They downgraded most unit costs, and now it is incredibly easy to get mass units and attack. Out of the 100 or so ladder games I have played, only a few involved zero rushing. Tournaments are boring, match after match, people love chatting about nothing. Clan support has added the new constant spamming. Every public channel involves tons of newb clans talking about how they \"pwn\" everyone and are \"1337\" so we should all join.The new units are boring. Spell breakers got old. Dragonhawks were in ROC just you couldn't build them, the AI could. Wyverns have had their name changed to Wind Riders for some odd reason. Batriders are fun, except noone goes them. I hate having to take down mountain giants, but they aren't too bad, same with those spirit walkers. Some units have been changed. Tanks are now engines and gyros are now flying machines. Boring. I don't know why they changed those units, but anyways. There are some new buildings, like nerubian towers, arcane towers, the 4 new item shops, thats about it for players. Than taverns and market places which are pretty boring.Neutral heroes are alright. Naga sea witch kinda boring, pit lord fun, beast master involves alot of summoning, dark ranger involves some life sucking, and the pandaran is probably the biggest relief. Its better than \"vashj\".

Each of the first three games contains important character information and backstory that is indispensable to fully enjoying MGS4 . Playing MGS4 without first experiencing MGS, MGS2, and MGS3 would be like seeing Star Wars Episodes 1-3 before seeing Episodes 4-6. In other words, a big mistake.*MGS4 truly sets the standard for graphics, storytelling, and production values on the PS3. No, you won't be mashing buttons on your controller as much as you're probably used to, as many people here have noted, but you WILL become emotionally connected to the story and characters at a level of intensity that is usually only reached by books and films.MGS Veterans*Yup, the controls have changed AGAIN. But the overall control scheme is pretty close to Snake Eater/Subsistence so the learning curve isn't too steep.*The default camera view is the same as in Subsistence. I find it to be much easier to use than the system in the first two MGS games, where one had to constantly switch between the fixed-perspective view and first-person view.*As usual, Kojima Productions has baked in a lot of replay value. There are rewards for completing the game in various ways, such as no kills, no alerts, or in a certain amount of time. There are is also a ranking system (emblems) that provides incentives for playing through the game multiple times.*Something that is very different from the rest of the series is the ability to purchase weapons, ammo, and other supplies at pretty much any time. This changes the dynamic of the game because foraging for items isn't terribly important anymore.*I wish a cut-scene theater was included, like in Subsistence. There isn't any way to view cut-scenes outside of the regular sequence of events in the game.*The game opens with a selection of faux TV shows and commercials. Watch carefully--many of the voice actors appear in these videos. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what the people behind the voices look like.*Be sure to download the free MGS4 Database from the PSN Store. It is a comprehensive history of the complete Metal Gear universe. Best of all, it's MGS4 spoiler-free until you've completed the game at least once.Bottom line: an essential, landmark video game that also serves as a stunning capstone to a legendary series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2009"}

However, after about 5 hours of play, I realized that this game is really not a 'game', but a digital novel that is closer to a 'Choose Your Adventure' novels I used to read when I was a kid. There is heavy dialog that is pure text and no voice work, which means within an average hour it's quite often that you will spend 50 minutes reading and scrolling through text, and only 10 minutes playing. This will appeal to some folks, but to me, I couldn't find enjoyment from it, given that I already do a lot of reading at work during the day, I really don't want to read any more than I have to at night time.If you enjoy reading, this will like a good game for you, just don't expect much actual gameplay.

I love mario kart but it is annoying that people r so crazy about it, calm down i have played every mario kart and the only difference in this one is the wheel motion which i do not care for. well anyways this game is fun and entertaining if its two players but thats how every mario kart is. I personaly do not like the wheel as much so i stick with the GC controller unless there is company. It has new charecters and new karts so that makes it more interesting. My favorite part of this game is the online which that is all i do when i play it. It is fun to play against people from around the world. This game is fun but Double Dash and 64 are a bit more fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2009"}

This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Papstein \"Link\"","summary":"No Title","reviewText":"The Nintendo Gamecube came out around 11/10-19/01 and from it's begining to this very day, it is considered as a child's system. They're partially right: About 60% of the videogames coming out are Teen & Mature rated,& only a fraction of them ever reach the 'cube (restating the fact that this is for mostly kids.)The console does pass at an 80% though. The graphics on Nintendo's latest console are better than ever, but Sony & Microsoft are still in the lead. The design of the Gamecube is.... well, a cube (duh). Compared with the PS2 and Xbox, it's the most compact of them all(mabey not the slim PS2), so you can set it up almost anywhere. If you're a die-hard Nintendo freak, then this for you.Anyone else may lose interest very quickly and buy another, different console, but keep reading.As I said in the begining, the graphics could be improved, but  about 100 of the games have stellar graphics.The controller, in my opinion, is the most comfortable for your hands than the other big-boy consoles. It dosen't have a kajillion buttons like it's underling, the N64.Also it is smaller than Xbox's mammoth controller. It sports 4 buttons, 3 shoulders, a joystick, control pad, and a camara changing c-stick.The games are mostly 1st party games(games made by their console company) with some big name multi-console games. Nintendo sticks to it's roots with its original titles, like Mario(mostly for kids), Donky Kong(party game/kid game), which uses bongos instead of a controller, Metroid(for teens and adults), and my favorite: The Legend of Zelda(for kids and teens and adults). Then some other games like Resident Evil 4, the NBA live series, and Prince of Persia.I'd say try the cube at a friends house, if you like it, buy it, or try the other consoles, you will find one you like. If you thinking of getting this one, here are some recomindations, you'll be satisfied: Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario 2, Metroid Prime 1&2, Zelda Wind Waker & Twilight Princess, Resident Evil 4, Prince of Persia, and Super Smash Bros.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"nintendofanforever \"slimshadyLP\"","summary":"same ol stuff","reviewText":"look i had tons of fun with this its great and all but just doesnt do it. its justnew boards and new games all the time. com on give us some more games. wat id do is combine all the games of the series and combine to one thrillin game. with better caracters like link. fun but sae stuff.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2003"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Good game but could use a little more meat.","reviewText":"I will give Evil Arts some credit. LotR is one of the very few movie licensed games that do rather well and just doesn't suck because it's a movie tie in.  As far as LotR:C is concerned, it's a good winter game that came out after all the great titles came within the last 2 months.Is it as memorable as the movie based games that came out on the last gen systems?No.And sadly to say, this almost has a twinge of too little too late.Meaning that had this game had been released around the same time the movie titles had come out or around the same time when BF:1942 was popular this title would easily had been a 4 start title but now that these types of games have advanced so much in game mechanics, it's hard to play this game without feeling like you want more.The game is pretty much a button masher with some elements of capture and defend a point.You can change your character at will and use lots of combos.And when you have done enough of the primary tasks, you get to use a hero like Aragorn, Gimily etc...you get the idea.Graphically speaking the game looks pretty good, the character designs are done pretty well altho there can be some issues with the framerate when a whole lot going on onscreen. All of the backdrops are done wonderfully as if you are playing those scenes from the movies.The control is pretty straightforward as I stated, this is a button masher so once you go thru the tutorial you should have the conrol downpat.Soundwise, it's almost a dream...from Helm's Deep to the Pellenor Fields, with the sound of battle and Howard Shore's soundtrack, you almost feel as if you are there.SO where does it all go wrong?- \"been there done that\" feel...and some of this gets repetitive after a while and when you get the Hero Character, it's a buffed up version of your grunt.- Still buggy - I had to reload the Helm's Deep stage because after I killed a certain group of creatures, the game didn't move to the next objective and after killing hordes of Uruks for 15 mins I realized that I had to start over because...- Lack of clear directions - the game is not all that great at always telling you when you have completed objective A or where exactly at Point B you need to be and I think this may have been a bug or something Pandemic overlooked when putting this game together which also leads to- Faulty multiplayer modes - getting into a game is easy but not all games are....I was playing mode where you had to move the Ring from one side of the battle area to the other. One thing I did not like and I am not sure if this was a bug or if this was intentional (since sometimes the ring wants to get lost) if a character dies while carrying the ring, you can't find on the map where it is.- Another issue that may not be good for multiplayer is since a lot of games have hopped on to that bandwagon, there is no way (as far as I have seen) to level your character up  as CoD has spoiled many gamers with being able to do this...without this mode, this game may leave some gamers wanting more.Overall if you a fan of LotR, it's a no brainer game but playing this almost makes me wish that another RPG (and not an MMORPG) or something with more substance was released. Not that this game isn't any fun, but it may not capture mine or anyone's attention for too long besides completing it.3 out of 5 stars.-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Wickedly Fast, Incredibly Brutal","reviewText":"Burnout 3 is the best arcade racer I have ever played, and quite possibly, the best 'traditional' racer likewise.With realistic racing sims flooding the video game market (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport) it is nice to see a racing game this simple, and this accessible.  This game is about fast cars, and brain-rattling car crashes.Burnout 3's racing is very straight forward, and rewards you for driving dangerously.  Racing towards oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding traffic (think Crazy Taxi) and drifting around corners gives you boost, which you can use to increase your speed even further (emphasized by a nice blur effect).  But driving aggressively and taking out your opponents is also rewarded: knock them into the side of the track or oncoming traffic, take them out, and your boost bar wil increase in size and fill up completely.  Crash again, and your boost bar decreases, bringing a nice balance to the gameplay.The racing is ridiculously fast, and drifting around corners and weaving through traffic is addicting.  Better still, it's made more intense by a huge sense of danger...  one crash could lose you the race.The crashes, as in past Burnout games, are out of control.  The cartoony graphics don't make them any less horrifying.  That's the series' claim to fame, and it shows.  Glass shatters, metal crumples, tires fly, cars roll out of control, grinding against pavement, smashing into anything in their path...  It's something to see.Best yet, it isn't just a racer.  In World Tour mode, you'll see all kinds of events (many that you can play on their own any time you want.)  These run from time trials, to Eliminator races (last car to pass the finish line each lap is eliminated until only one is left), road rage (see how many Takedowns you can achieve against three opponents until either the time runs out or your car is destroyed) to Crash mode.Crash mode is where the debris really flies.  Pick a car and barrel towards a busy intersection (with one hundred to unlock and choose from) and see how much destruction you can cause.  Once enough cars block the streets its almost disturbing watching the speeding traffic barrel into the pile-up.  Once a certain number of crashes have occurred, use the Crashbreaker, which causes your car to explode, causing more chaos, and allowing you to steer what remains of your car in slow motion towards power ups and money multipliers.Best of all, this game has a wealth of unlockables.  It keeps track of points you earn for driving well in races, monetary damage caused during crashes, takedowns achieved, and rewards you with cars, new courses, etc. for reaching certain goals.  This not only gives you great incentive to go back and play some more, it is a satisfying way to work for unlockables.This game, especially at its new lower price point, is highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2005"}

I actually pick this up mainly because of a bargin price at the time.  I am glad I did because this game is awesome.The single player is great.  It is by no means a push over as most FPS single player components are.  It offers a good challenge on any of the difficulties and the battles can get really intense.  AI is very intelligent.  They don't sit there waiting for you to kill them.  They are constantly moving instead of just running for cover and never moving from it.  The story is enough to keep you going from level to level and is good.  I also did not forget about the singleplayer game after I finished it as I usually do.The multiplayer is also great.  Lots of options on gameplay (deathmatch, capture and hold/destroy, assassination/survive), lots of metals to earn, and lots of soldier types to keep you from getting bored.  I did not have any  problems finding matches and they come together pretty quickly.For Parents: Very little blood and no gore.  The only thing to watch for is the near constant cursing in the singleplayer game.  Other than that nothing really offensive.Suggestions:  If you are online, please do not use the headset unless you are in a clan.  It is really annoying for others when we can all hear your crappy music or when you are having a conversation with your mom about taking out the garbage.

Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"3D at its best!","reviewText":"A number of reviews have already been written about this game so I think it is redundant for me to go into a lot of detail on the story, gameplay, and graphics.  I will say that its graphics are the best to date in a Motorstorm game and the the controls are very responsive.  The game feels like the difficulty may have been ramped down a little, but it is still enjoyable, nonetheless.  I have played the full one hour game trial and downloaded the bundle that includes all DLC that is supposedly 50% off for playstation plus subscribers.  You can get the game for about thirty five bucks most places now so the benefit to the bundle through PSN is really getting all DLC for free which still is a decent deal.  What I really wanted to talk about is the 3D experience.  If you have a 3D television, this game, in my opinion, does the best job with 3D of any of the 3D compatible games I have purchased to date.  While I enjoyed Gran Turismo 5 and Ghost Recon future soldier I think the 3D in both of them was tacked on and therefore was horrible.  Blacks Ops did a better job with 3D than those two games but Motorstorm Apocolypse is the 3D experience I was waiting for.  From the moment I booted up the game the 3D looked so amazing that I decided I needed to get this game.  My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner, but it got lost on my radar with other games that were coming out at the time.  My daughter really enjoyed just sitting there and watching me play a racing game because the 3D in it is that good.

{"product_name":"B007W8S2MG","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"A much needed RPG for the PS Vita","reviewText":"The PlayStation Vita is a great system, but it really needed a solid RPG.  Well, we finally have one!  I've played Persona 1 and 3, so the series isn't new to me.  Much like the previous entries, you're playing as a group of high school kids who're trying to combat an evil presence in your hometown.  As many people say, the game is an RPG with some sort of \"Sims\" elements.  I've never played The Sims, but I think I can see where they're coming from.  You need to balance your in-game life.  You can do whatever you'd like after school and at night.  Whether it be dungeon-crawling in the afternoon and sleep at night, or socializing then work.  But if you don't strike some sort of balance, then it's Game Over.  Now let's get into some impressions that I have about this game...Sound and Graphics:The graphics are cell-shaded anime style, and are quite fluid.  The style fits the game perfectly.  The music, much like the rest of the titles in the series, is made up of catchy J-pop'ish tunes.  I really like what they've done here!Gameplay:The controls are pretty standard.  I haven't had any real issues with figuring anything out (no manual was needed.)  The social-life aspect, as well as the fusion of personae keeps things interesting.  There is no \"best\" way to play the game.  You'll likely find a way that suits your tastes, and it'll likely be different from other players.  Over all, I really like the mechanics of the game.Characters and Story:I find that characters in many JRPG's can be very annoying and over-the-top.  Not so much the case here.  Each character was well-written, and the voice acting is well-done.  (They also have an option to turn off the voices during gameplay.  With this feature enabled, you only have to listen to them during the cut-scenes.)  The storyline is quite good, in my opinion.  They have this whole mysterious murder thing going on, and you are hellbent on figuring out what's going on; quite original, from my experiences.Ultimately, I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to.  The awesome story with good characters, great graphics and music, intuitive play controls and an interesting mix between RPG and life-simulation make for a winning combination. Any Vita owner who is looking for a solid RPG should check this game out!  Hell, I'm sad that I missed it on the PS2!  :(","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Brian Forrester \"Brian Forrester, Noblesville IN\"","summary":"Excellent game!","reviewText":"Excellent graphics, excellent game play, improved difficulty.

Klinko \"nureveww\"","summary":"Early Adoption, Don't Wait!","reviewText":"This game is a lot of fun, my favorite out of the 5 games I have purchased at launch.  Soccer is hilarious, basically you pass the ball down the field (choosing from a left pass, right pass or straight pass), while your opponent attempts to block the pass.  Once you get past defenders and are 1v1 with the goalie you can shoot, and your opponent can try to save.  It sounds simple enough but the camera is very responsive and the game gets frenetic and fun while playing.  There are also opportunities for throw ins, corner kicks and headers etc, but the nuts and bolts is the simple pass and shoot.Next there is bowling, which is a lot of fun and again the camera is very responsive.Track and field has 5 events.  Sprint, pretty basic....run in place.  Next is Javelin Throw, also fun.  Then there is the long jump, which is cool.  Following that is discus, actually very lame, could not consistantly get good flights from discus.  Lastly is hurdles, not really all that fun, but ok.Next up is Boxing.  Boxing is ok, but by far the most effective tactic is throw wildly rather than take a methodical approach...that actually kind of ruins it for me, I wanted something a little more strategy and skill based.Beach Volleyball is a lot of fun, but it really seems the most forgiving with its camera response.  I feel like a lot of times if you are just in the general viscinity it will count as a bump.  Scoring can take a lot of volleys but I guess that is ok.Last is Table Tennis.  Response is pretty good not much variation in shots and putting spin seems rather difficult.There are also minigames for many of the sports listed, helps keep the replay up.  The comparisons to the Wii SPorts are inevitable and in all honesty, besides the superior graphics of the xbox, the comparison is merited.  The thing that really gives this title the one up may or may not have anything to do with the game itself.  The Kinect camera I think is what sets this game apart.  You can play in darkness in the middle of the living room, you can play with people of all sizes (I have two kids that played and it calibrated them seamlessly), the camera really responds!  The funny replays at the end of each event is awesome too, you really look completely foolish playing these games and the playback is a helpful reminder not to take these games too serious!  This title is worth the $50, some of the other games you can just rent (fighters uncaged, sonic riders etc).  Great Party Game, Great to play with kids, and a great guilty pleasure to just play by yourself!

Assassin's Creed II was even better than the first...a milestone in every respect.  AC Brotherhood, on the other hand, is best left on store shelves.Here's the problem:  THE CONTROLS!  I alluded to this problem briefly in a previous Assassin's Creed review of mine, but the controls in Brotherhood really SUCK. It is in this particular AC title that the control scheme's failings are truly emphasized. Specifically, I'm talking about the combat controls.  When you're trying to take over the Borgia Towers, you're often bombarded with tons of enemies on screen at once.  Besides the fact that I've noticed a significant drop in frame rate, there's a problem trying to disarm enemies.  Normally (and what the game tells you to do), you have to select the fist icon, target your enemy, hold the counter button (R1) and press the disarm button at the right time.  Why didn't this work at all with the spear-holding and axe-carrying enemies????  It did in Assassin's Creed 2!!  What was the problem here??  There's absolutely no way to disarm these enemies, and I've tried to research this in quite a few walkthroughs.  Even when trying to counter, you STILL take damage.  My guess is that it's a major glitch in the game.I'm not even going to go into the jumping/wall-climbing controls.  They still kept those the same from previous titles, and that needs serious work.  When you want Ezio to jump one way, he goes in another direction.  It's ridiculous!Whatever the case may be, the disarming element made me erupt in extreme frustration, and I proceeded to forcefully quit my game and delete all Assassin's Creed files on my PS3 hard drive.  I happened to obtain a pirated copy of AC Revelations (the newest title in this now-defunct series) for the Xbox 360, but I'm not even going to bother playing it.As a result, I am going to trade this game in, as well as the previous two AC titles, to Amazon this week.  I would much rather salvage some of my money back and let someone else buy my used copy so that Ubisoft never gets any profit from the sale of a new copy.Never in my life have I experienced such a poorly designed combat control scheme for a video game...especially since the previous game in the series was almost perfect!  Why the departure, Ubisoft?  WHY?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

The graphics and effects have been improved from the previous game though the controls are basically the same on how to control your partner if you're playing solo and the A.I. of your partner seems to have been improved as well as he actually provides better support for you.  The overkill ability is pretty mice to have especially when you're in a tight fix with a horde of enemies,think of it as a standard meter where after a certain amount of kills have been reached you're able to perform a bullet time effect without the hassle of reloading.The story plot plays like one we've seen in about a hundred Hollywood movies so what happens isn't really shocking but it's still entertaining nonetheless.

E Jackson","summary":"a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star","reviewText":"Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}

Not only is this the best DS RPG I have played, but it is one of the best RPGs I have played on any system. The graphics are colorful, the battle animations are fun, the story is good, and the dialog is entertaining. The game is huge, and there are plenty of things to do. Being able to change classes once you get to a certain point adds an extra level of depth. The game play is so much fun, that even tedious experience grinding is enjoyable.The only negative thing I have found is that the game was not designed for the &#34;XL&#34; screens, so people using the larger screens will see black bars on the side on the top screen.

Lethal","summary":"well worth picking up on a Black Friday special","reviewText":"As someone getting tired of the old &#34;drive from A to B, shoot a bunch of enemies, drive from B to A again, mission complete&#34; format, the superpowers in this game are very welcome, as are the alien weapons that let you create a black hole for enemies and vehicles to get sucked into, a ray that makes people inflate and explode, and the dubstep gun, a destructive take on the Groovitron from Ratchet & Clank.  The gameplay here feels fundamentally different from the prior entries and it's fun.  After initially resolving to skip a lot of the side activities and focus on the story, I ended up doing it all to unlock bonus powers and weapons.The story is a lot of fun, though parts of it would be hard to follow if you haven't played the rest of the series.  I laughed a number of times at the jokes.  It's a bit unnerving as some deliberate visual &#34;glitches&#34; show up to remind you the game world is an alien simulation, but over a span of around 40 hours of play it only actually crashed once and that was during a load screen.  The graphics are decent if dated, the sound is quite good (though several times during cutscenes it's off like a 70's martial arts film), and I was glad the game has lots of Kinzie Kensington, my favorite character.Don't let the mixed reaction to superpowers scare you off, it's fun to sprint across the city faster than cars and actually knock them out of your path rather than drive around, plus you always have the option to hear the in-game radio stations even on foot.  If you're a fan of the Saints you should definitely pick this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

And this has proved once again with his latest release of \"Tom Clancey's Chaos Theory.\"Graphics: The graphics in this game are probobly the best out of all the games on Xbox. Everything from the character designs, to the facial expressions, to even the background is amazing. The lighting in the game is also incredible and one to brag about definetely. All in all, the graphics in this game are truely wonderful!Gameplay: Another great feature of this game is the gameplay aspect. You can basically do whatever you want in the game that you could do in the previous Tom Clancey game, Pandora Tomorrow with many more features as well, which includes hanging off a rope with a knife and slitting their necks. The controls do however take a long time to get used to, so that might be a problem if you are a younger audience and less experienced with the Xbox.Audio: This is probobly the best aspect of the entire game, the audio. You can hear footsteps from behind you, to the left, right or in front of you depending on which direction the enemy is coming at you from. The voices are amazing and it is so clear that you can hear everything that they are saying. The gunshots sound extremely realistic along with everything else in this masterpiece of a game.Online: This aspect is good, just like any other multiplayer online game, except the only problem is that you can only have four people playing at one time online. But thats not enough of a problem to give this game less then five stars!In conclusion, this game is a must have for all Tom Clancey fans!

This game has gone the distance with graphics, AI, and has an incredible story line to follow which in some way is uncommon in a FPS. I mean Wolfenstein and Medal of Honor are both excellent games, I just use these two particular games as examples because anyone who loves FPS gaming have most likely played thes games. I have completed the game two times now and am considering playing a third time after I finish the other current games that I am playing ( Die Hard, C&C Renegade, Red Faction, Operation Flashpoint, and Neverwinter Nights ). I recently invested in a new Ge-Force 4 128mbTI4600 video card and all I can say is that the graphics on SOF 2 are nothing short of amazing. Another plus to this game is the realistic violence. I know that many parents do not care for this type of thing and the game does include a violence lock with password for younger players. For us older gamers, I think that we appreciate a nice gory game where it so properly belongs. I try to not make my reviews too long so in closing, I will say that this game is one in a long time to really excite me and keep me playing for hours on end. It is not too easy even on the easy setting, so it should be a challeng to finish even for a constant FPS player. Get this game.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Involving and Gripping","reviewText":"I played this before Parasite Eve 1, and was a little lost as regards the background story, but its one of my favourite games. Firstly the story is absorbing and exciting (always important). I liked all the characters, especially Aya, and followed the plot with without getting lost nearly all the time! Secondly, the graphics are superb. Pre-rendered backgrounds ( yes, they are in the style of Resident Evil) look incredible, and the monsters are among the creepiest since Silent Hill. The characters all look and move realistically, even the pet dog Flint! Plus of course, the battle system, which in my opinion is outstanding. In this game, you face the enemy in real time, and you have to run around avoiding attacks, whilst trying to attack and heal yourself at the same time, or try and stay safe for the few vital seconds it takes to cast a powerful magic spell. In my opinion, this form of combat is far preferable to the static, turn-based encounters of traditional RPGs, and much more exciting. These battles are not random, in fact you can choose whether or not to fight on a lot of occasions with the use of a handy scanner that warns of enemy infestated areas. Of course, you can't avoid the bosses, and these battles are suitably long and tough. I still remember the huge fat thing with a flame thrower in its mouth... Still, you might not want to avoid battles, as more fighting means more experience, and more power, which you will definitely need as things get incredibly tough in the final stages, leading up to a prolonged and a spectaular showdown.... it's true I may be biased, being more of a survival horror fan than RPG player, but this game really works. It beats so many other games out there easily, and in my mind is more satisfying than the first game, which had some serious control issues-at least Aya can actually run in this game! I have no complaints whatsoever...Oh all right, just one - How about some dialogue! I would love to have heard Aya speak, but not once, even in cut scenes!

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"An Awesome End to the Halo Trilogy","reviewText":"CAMPAIGN:(no spoilers)Halo 3's campaign is excellent, and provides an awesome end to Bungie's Halo trilogy. The Master Chief has just arrived back at Earth, and Cortana is still stuck on High Charity, the Covenant's capital city-ship. The Covenant are excavating a Forerunner artifact in Africa, and the UNSC is curious as to what it is...The Chief's return is a welcome one, and it is very fun to play as him again. Our favorite characters like the Arbiter, Sergeant Johnson, and Miranda Keyes all return, and it is interesting to see how they fit in with the story.  The weapons of Halo 3 are still the classic Halo ones that we love, and new ones are added as well. The graphics are amazing, and you'll find yourself in awe at the colorful jungles of Africa, the secure and militaristic feel of a base, and the beautiful landscapes, literal \"paintings in motion\". The missions are all very fun, although one isn't quite on par. The vehicles that we know and love have returned too, and new ones are available for us to use. The story is very epic and gripping, and you'll be on the edge of your seat in anticipation. The ending was very satisfying and heroic, and you truly feel like the fight is finished. Skulls have returned, and all have to be found in somewhat tricky spots (remember, the internet is your friend). Campaign is still playable with up to 4 friends, splitscreen or over Xbox Live, and is very enjoyable and entertaining. Legendary is still pretty difficult, but that difficulty is diminished if you play with a decently-skilled friend or two. Marty O'Donnell's spectacular soundtrack is returning, and makes for an even more dramatic and essential part of the story. This campaign will certainly keep you playing for years to come. 9.5/10MULTIPLAYER:Halo 3's multiplayer is very fun, albeit very unoccupied at the moment. If you can find a game, though, it is a very fun time, and the new equipment, vehicles, and weapons make it even more enjoyable. I cannot comment much on the multiplayer as I have not played it that much, but it is awesome from what I've played of it. 10/10FORGE:Forge is a game mode where you can edit the maps included with the game: not the landscape itself, but rather the placement of structures, vehicles, and weapons. This is all done in real time, so you and some buddies can work hard or play hard. It is very entertaining and lets your creativity shine. 10/10CUSTOM GAMES:Custom games has returned, so you can make your own gametypes and try them out on the default or Forge maps. This is very interesting, and can provide some fun nights and hilarious moments. Many, many things can be changed, such as default loadouts, movement speed, gravity level, or damage done by players. Experimentation is the fun part of this, and seeing how your game plays is a truly amazing process. 10/10THEATER:Theater is a mode where you can watch, record, and take screenshots of your multiplayer, forge, custom games, or campaign playthroughs. You can even watch with some friends, and you can freely fly around the map for a bird's eye view of what's going on. This can be used for many purposes, such as rewatching over and over again an epic failure or victory, analyzing the enemy team's tactics, or simply getting a look at the map, Theater is a cool feature. 10/10OVERVIEW:Halo 3 is an excellent game, and will remain one for years and years to come. The campaign is exciting and the other modes are awesome, providing for hours and hours of entertainment for you and your friends. It's certainly worth the $20, and I highly recommend buying a game guide to go with this.9.8/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"A Hot Whizzer Summer...","summary":"Could have been a better game.","reviewText":"While many people state that it is lacking in storyline, this is an understatement. As a matter of fact, it has no storyline. The start of the game has an fmv intro, this is the only piece of dialogue shared by the characters in the entire game. The only backstory is obtained by reading the guide, which suggests that your team, which consists of extremely opposing personalities, just happen to be immune and end up together. Despite everyone these guys knew and loved died two weeks ago, these guys don't seem too shook up about it.The only goal is to survive, the most complex the game gets is having to activate something, an event that for sometimes no reason at all, summons a hoard of zombies. The \"bosses\" the game suggests are not bosses at all, but random popup special zombies that exhibit special properties. You will run into many of them in each level, and are only slightly more difficult than your basic level mob. Even the tanks are only really tough in enclosed spaces or when you are caught by surprise. So that makes only five basic enemies you will verse in the entire game. No zombie dogs, birds, or any other classic zombie enemies.My other beef with the game I have is the behavior of the zombies. They sit or stand around doing nothing (occasionally vomitting). You never see them eating the corpse of another human or trying to break through a door, which I don't think gives them too much of a realistic effect.Besides that, the game has an incredible amount of detail, and is rather fun. People talk about the AI director and how incredible it is, but all it really does is cause random popping, which is something that has existed in rpg's for years. Admittedly it is more advanced, but still, random repoping does not mean \"different experience every time\".Besides that fact, it is a fun game, and perhaps even worth owning on those days you feel like killing some zombies. Also, I imagine it could be a pretty fun party game when a group of people get together and want to have some fun zombie murder maham. And since that is the main point of the game's design, I suppose I can't hate it too much. I hope in the next left 4 dead, they bring a better storyline and we have a chance to learn more about our characters and hear more of their amusing dialogue.Update:After so much time playing this game (because my wife is absolutely addicted to it and won't stop playing), I have realized that this game has many many faults. Mostly, it is incredibly glitchy. I am often shocked at how many glitches I experience with this game, considering how simple the game is. After playing the likes of fallout 3, I find it embarrassing how glitchy this game can be, considering how much less detail, quality, and quantity of stuff was put into this game. This is better suited as an open source game for the amount of care put into it. I guess this shows you that you don't need to put time or effort into a game to make it a top seller, and there is no proportionality to the amount of effort, money, and work and how addicted people will become to it.Maybe I am being a bit too critical, but it just bugs me how a game so devoid of any real effort by the programmers could become so popular. Now they are going to release L4D2, which my wife will force us to buy, because the programmers realized that they COULD release maps and fix errors, fulfilling the complaints of people like me, OR they could just release a new game and get $60 a pop from everyone who wanted more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003TIVSM4","description":"","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Awesome Game Despite Some Issues","reviewText":"when I first saw the preview trailer of this game I was sure I had to have it at some point. I'm heavy into Warhammer 40 K, the videogames and the books, not the tabletop game. My first exposure was the excellent Dawn of war RTS. Since then I've purchased nearly every Warhammer game except Soul Storm, even picking up Fire Warrior. I've also read a couple dozen books.The first thing you'll notice about Space Marine is that it looks beautiful. The graphics are simply astounding. You'll need a decent graphics card to handle them, but it doesn't have to be a top-of-the-line card. I'm running a GeForce 240, which is at or below the low end of the required video card, and I turned the graphics down just to be safe, but the game seems to run just fine without any slowdown. Though I probably wouldn't try running it with anything less.  Not sure if it's because of this, but I have the EVGA GeForce GT 240 512 MB DDR5 model, which is faster memory than the GT 240 DDR3 model available so maybe try the demo.The story is a bit tired, Ork attack, Space Marines sent into secure the area in front of rescue fleet.  You battle a bunch of Orks until you meet the \"surprise\" twist enemies in the last 3rd of the game.  The combat between melee and ranged attacks is practically seamless.  I liked combat.  It'd be fair to say it can get repetitive, but I had great fun all the way through doing it.  Everything looks simply beautiful.You get to use a chain sword, a combat axe, and the super powerful maul.  When using the maul you're limited to the weaker of your projectile weapons as compensation, though really I spent most of the time fighting melee and using my bolter so it really didn't matter except in a few fights from a distance.  They also let you use a jump pack on several occasions, which was great fun and allows you some more variety in your attacks.Now for the problems and there are several.  First, the game is short, really short.  Start to finish took me a little under 9 hours.  There are only 17 true levels and an unplayable 18th epilogue level.  I finished it in a couple of days.  There's not that much to go back to play again, though I enjoyed it quite a bit and probably will.  You can get a good chunk of fun from playing online, if you can get connected to a game, which helps a bit, but you have to pay for extra DLC to play the cool stuff like playing as a Dreadnaught.The game is a Steam Works game, so you have to have Steam installed.  You also can never sell/trade the game since the code is forever tied to your Steam account.  Steam terms are also that a game is \"rented\" for the one time rental fee.  Even if you buy the game retail here it's the same thing (you're only buying the code to link it to a Steam account).  You don't own the game.  They can close your account for most any reason, though in practice they only really do for billing disputes.  A tip, do not pay with PayPal or a debit card; if there's an issue and billing gets disputed they can and will lock ALL games on your account.  I've never had a problem with Steam though some people hate it. So you've been warned.  Also, the DVDs that come with it just install part of the game.  You'll still have to download about 2.5 GB from Steam to complete the install.  If you're on a bandwidth limit, keep that in mind.  Your install will likely take at least a couple of hours even though you have DVDs.  Lame.The last problem, it is VERY glitchy.  I was having crashes AT LEAST once a level, however the game has frequent saves and generally it wasn't at the same place, so I didn't mind that much.  Eventually, it got annoying so I looked up and if you have BitDefender AntiVirus it may interfere.  I cleared out my temp folder, verified my Steam cache, and set an exception in BitDefender AVC to the program file (easy to do, a quick web search can get you instructions).  After that, maybe one more crash.  However, I still got all kinds of little glitches, like not being able to pick up audio logs, enemies hitting me from too far away, attacks sometimes not working, and really annoying times when I just sort of ran in slow motion despite using dash.Overall, if you're really into Warhammer 40k, then now that it's dropped in price it's a now brainer.  This isn't the end all experience, it's not perfect, and again it's pretty short with not much new replay, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and will replay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2012"}

There are little holes so you can charge the PSP, have headphones in, turn the PSP on or off, and press the L and R buttons, which is great if you are listening to music. When the PSP is in the case, it weighs quite a bit. I'd guess maybe 1.5 pounds. But that means this thing is heavy duty; and it should be; while I was at EB Games buying this, the guy said this was a really good case and he dropped his ( somehow ) from 2 stories high. It saved the PSP and mearly CRACKED THE CASE. That's not hard to believe, since this thing is rock solid. The only real bad thing about this case, though, is the fact that you can't put any thing else in it. No space for headphones or extra Memory Sticks, sadly. I try to put memory sticks and the PSP cloth in mine, and it fits, but it feels like it could open, so it isn't recommended. And since there are holes in the case, it's not at all water proof, in case you spill something over it.

I also consider myself a hardcore gamer, very skilled, etc. Deomon's Souls has received very high marks from most reputable sources, but I was expecting Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) with heavy RPG elements. That was not what I got.Demon's Souls is a hack n' slash RPG. Think Jade Empire or Fable, but far more linear, less story and at no point will you ever be able to exert your highly leveled up character as a total B.A.M.F. There are many very well detailed reviews explaining the nuts and bolts of gameplay available, so I will stick to what stood out to me:The controls are easy and intuitive. Although the information is presented in a sloppy fashion, anyone that has time with RPG's will be able to figure out what they are doing pretty quickly. The graphics are solid, not mind blowing, but definately exceed Dragon Age (and if you don't like the cartoony look of Borderlands, you will probably prefer this too). Considering the length of the game, I would say it looks and plays well above average.Here's where it all comes apart for me. The much vaunted difficulty. It's just not that hard. Instead I found it slow and tedius. When watching the bloodstained remnents of other players, I typically saw people running forward, to their death. Simple solution. Don't run. Ever. Through the first 4 levels I died 4 times. Once in the tutorial, where it is eminent, I touched fire and fell off a couple platforms. It absolutely is NES style trial in error.That is where my second complaint lies. Many reviews claim that deaths are never cheap, that they can all be avoided. I call BS on that statement. You will frequently CREEP into a pitch black room only to have a creature jump at you. A simple back jump or roll and you are usually safe, but there are times when your animations will carry you over a ledge and I assume that memorization for the trickier parts is required later down the line. I found my character moving VERY slowly, constantly clicking R3 to get the auto lock on something out of sight and heavy use of magic. Perhaps running and gunning to my death repeatedly would have changed my experience for the better, but clearly the game was designed to be played at a very deliberate pace. AGAIN I STRESS - IT WASN'T HARD, YOU JUST HAVE TO GO REALLY SLOW.Add to these complaints a very quiet soundtrack and in place of great atmosphere, I just found myself bored.This is strictly my opinion, but there are a lot of games that move at a much faster pace and are equally as rewarding (Devil May Cry 3, Ninja Gaiden even some FPS' like Killzone on Elite). Contrary to many of the reviews, this game cannot be played anyway you like - it can only be played slowly. Take my review with a grain of salt, I prefer the fast paced, in your face type of game, and I really was expecting a challenge more in line with Ninja Gaiden with exceptional RPG elements. Instead I got a generic story in a generic land served without much flavor that I got to crawl through.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

You will realize that after the tutorial and even after you run into your first actually challenging foe.  This isn't a bad thing though as the RPG world needed a change and Demon's Souls finds a great balance with immerse gameplay that rewards you for a good job.Gameplay: Perhaps the biggest negative to Demon's Souls in a good way.  This game is hard.  Not just normal hard, painfully hard.  The learning curve is very steep and the game doesn't pull punches.  The tutorial barely preps you for the pain about to come especially if you can reach the World 1-2 boss.  This is good though.  The game is unforgiving but rewarding.  In short you are a hero trapped within a kingdom possessed by a great spirit.  When you die you are reborn as a spirit and if you defeat a \"boss\" you are revived (or you can join someone's game and help them beat a boss to revive)  The MP element is a little complex but works.  Everything you do also earns you souls.  You use souls to level up, upgrade weapons, buy items etc.  There is no limit to the creativity you can have.  All it takes is a little time and grind some extra souls and you can have a rogue who shoots fireballs.  Every class is well balanced to handle every foe and boss; just have to throw in some creativity.Sound/Story: Amazing.  While there isn't much dialogue the game really is about environment and gameplay.  In this regards the sound is spot on. Armor sounds heavy, weapons hit with force, monsters growl with a deep hatred for you.  The story is also very good.  It is subtle but the storyline is there.  It is just one of those games where the storyline is up to you.  Atlus doesn't hand feed it to you, instead they rely on you exploring and running into NPCs and talking to people to uncover the mystery.  There is a reason why this game was RPG of the year 2009 and Game of the Year 2009Graphics/Presentation: This game looks fantastic.  Perhaps one of the most beautiful games on the PS3. With that said be prepared to replay levels.  When you die you respawn back at the start of the level with ZERO souls.  You then have to redo the level.  Touch your bloodstain and you get all your souls back.  Frustrating but gives a sense of reward at the same time.  the Multiplayer set up is fantastic.  Basically you will see \"ghosts\" moving around you. Those are actually other players and the game is showing you what they are doing.  At any time you can drop messages, read other messages and watch the deaths of other people to provide possible tips. Lay down an invite message while in \"physical form\" you can invite players in soul form to help you.  As a soul you can join another's game to help OR invade someone's game and PvP them.Length/Replay: pretty much infinite.  If you are very.. very.. very good you can speed run the game in an hour.  That is.. skipping every trash mob, ignoring all talking and combat and memorizing every single boss move so you can take them down in a few minutes.  In reality, the game is very long.  Once you beat the game the game you can Game+ mode. Basically the game starts all over again like you are in Limbo but keep all your levels and gear.  Enemies are then scaled up.  There are some people going on a Game+++ and it gets VERY challenging which is a good thing.  There is no easy street.Overall Score: 96%A must have for any true RPG fan or someone looking for a real challenge.  There are almost no \"cons\" to this game. The only issue people have is how the MP is setup.  It can be confusing at first but actually works really well.  I won't even get started with Light and Dark versions of the world maps!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007FQUEZ8","reviewerName":"Facelord","summary":"Great HD collection, sadly lacking Peace Walker","reviewText":"This is a very high-quality HD collection. It's very rare that you'll ever see any framerate drops, it's very consistent. The game's resolution is technically below the Vita's screen resolution(960x544) at 720x448, surprisingly only wider in resolution than the PS2 originals(512x448). Definitely not optimal, but the games play like a dream and look more glorious than they did in 2001/2004 because of the wider aspect ratio and the fact the Vita's screen is OLED.The titles could've been optimized better, but they're better than the original versions and they're more than playable. My only complaint about the two titles is that MGS3 lacks those silly videos you could unlock in Subsistence, instead only giving the player access to all the cutscenes in the game... even if they haven't completed it yet. I'd hate for the game's story to be spoiled by curiosity, but I'm sure most people who end up purchasing the MGS HD Collection already know the stories of the two games by heart. Luckily for me, I had forgotten MGS2's story so it all felt so fresh to me; MGS3, on the other hand, I forgot some of the story details but could remember the key moments.Sadly, the HD collection lacks any version of Peace Walker due to the 3.4gb memory limit in Vita cartridges; technically they could've gone for a higher capacity card, but it would've cost a little more to manufacture and they would've had to downgrade the PS3 version of Peace Walker or just slap the PSP version in lazily, adding a bunch to development costs when the game's already technically available on Vita. This wouldn't be that big an issue to me if the cost of the HD collection plus Peace Walker was about the same as the console HD collection. Sadly this isn't the case, Peace Walker is still too pricy for me at $30 and I haven't ever seen it on sale on PSN. I actually purchased Peace Walker on UMD shortly after release for $20, giving me way more reason not to purchase it for Vita. Sadly I didn't play the game much because of the PSP's lack of a right analog stick making the controls really awkward, so the Vita version would be perfect for me. I really hope Konami drops the price of Peace Walker on PSN and makes the game available without needing to transfer it from PS3.Last note: I recommend against purchasing this game from PSN, I made that mistake and now I can't loan the game to friends, plus it takes up a good portion of my 32gb memory card so I'll have to delete it to make room for more PSP titles, PSone Classics and download-only Vita games within a month or two. :&lt;All that said, I still recommend the MGS HD Collection very highly for the Vita, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into and buy it at retail. MGS2 and MGS3 are two of the best games on the PS2, and while I hate that half the story is told through Codec calls and the rest through long-winded speeches you'd be surprised at how moving and intellectually gratifying the Metal Gear games can be. Also, there's an Easter egg in MGS2 that has a guard unknowingly pee on Raiden from above. Pretty sweet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

Like other than the developers making the game they have nothin in common so it's good these guys didnt still anything from the other....Good: great story, tons of actions, gore!, overall gameplay when it comes to upgrading weapons and just how you go about killing enemies in diff ways.Bad: you will prob die over and over at certain parts of the game depending on how you like to kill. Run and gun type of players will find it frustrating as there are times when 7 monsters are coming at you and you have to take 8 seconds to reload smh and you're dead after that. Then stealth guys will find it frustrating you cant stealth kill some zombies. Like most gsmes these days the computer buddy that suppose to help you kill enemies only shoot about 3 rounds and take cover for about 20 seconds then shoot 3 more. So if you go in charging they will stand behind waiting until you clear a path.Conclusion: great for your action adventure guys but call of duty players(online) will prob get tired of replaying the levels quickly after seeing the run n gun doesn't work well on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00DHF39KS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeffrey Owens","summary":"A Surprisingly Amazing Shooter, With Just A Couple Scratches (9.0 of 10)","reviewText":"I remember as a kid playing my fathers games with him. From Doom to Metal Gear Solid, I played all sorts of games all across the board ever since I was a kid. Going into this game, I honestly had low expectations. All of the trailers and videos I had seen did not impress me for some reason. Don't get me wrong, the game looks fun and looked nice mostly, but nothing about the news of the game were really all that inspiring for me to make me play it. That was until I gave the game a shot, and let me tell you that it was one of my better decisions I have made.The story is the main reason why I love the game so much. At first, it seems pretty straight forward and simplistic, but also boring and by the numbers (nothing that COD or anything haven't already worked with or towards in some fashion already). But this changed right after the first mission; the story is still straight forward and easy to follow. However, the story becomes stronger, more grounded, more emotional and connectable all because of the character development, the arcs of the story, and the interactions of the characters. Without spoiling anything, I will avoid talking about the story and further or the characters themselves, but know that the story and the path the story takes is fantastic, as well as refreshing in an era full of bland and passable story modes in games; this game is single player only, and is the better for it.The mechanics are also tight and solid. The cover mechanics operate quite a bit like Killzone; you hug to whatever cover is near you with the left trigger (L2), and you move around the cover piece with the move stick. This allows for the ability to pear over cover, peak around, or peak under cover pieces in whatever manner you wish. The reason why I love this cover mechanic so much is because you never feel stuck on cover, but instead you move around any piece of cover at will, and yet can easily run on the move again too without having the Velcro feel (it makes sense for that in 3rd person shooter games, but 1st person shooters should avoid it in my opinion). All of the guns feel solid, nice, and react the way I would expect them to if they were real. I love that the guns are never fully kept at all times, but instead picked up in each mission; gives more weight to the storyline and what happens in it. Overall, the shooting, cover, movement, and so on all feel fantastic and smooth.On to the other aspects of the game. For one, the sound is great. All the guns sound great, the voice acting and and dialogue is awesome and actually avoids the game feeling too campy or corny. Also, the machines and so on also all sound great. The level designs are all interesting and awesome; they are cool set-pieces that actually have a cool direction that the level ends up revealing. Also, for a first person shooter of this sort to actually have old school hidden areas, it is a godsend to a gamer like me. Plus, I love the fact that there are health and armor upgrades to be found, as well as the collectibles actually being really cool and builds the story even further. Spin off the health and armor system, I love the fact that they reintroduced the old school health systems of old with the new school; the health works by points, with armor being able to be picked up to help reduce damage to the health meter a little, but the game also has a regeneration system that will only restore up to the next nearest even 10th number (so if your health falls to 70 points, then it will regenerate to 80).All of the above are my loves and positives in this game, but really I only have one gripe, and really it is small (yet noticeable enough to deduct a point obviously). This game being a next gen title, I expected it to look better than it does. Now, the character models and most of the areas look great; the game shines when in the sunlight and when outdoors. However, the game does a much weaker job in detail and beauty when it comes to the indoors and the normal, bland grey areas (like the subway or the first mission). The details in the areas of the game could have been better, as well as some of the enemies at times, but really like most of my articles graphics are never the biggest deal so long as they are not horrible (by the way, 8-bit games looks great to me if the aesthetics is kick ass; aesthetics is not graphics). My one other gripe is the amount of activity to earn from the game. I only complain on this topic mostly because I am use to my shooter titles having an extra mode somewhere (most times it is MP related, but a Horde like mode or something would have been cool to do, or Spec Ops or something). Both of these points are small and do not take away much from the game at all, but instead leave just a tad bit to be desired in some areas.This game is fun, exciting, interesting, and should be played and tried by anybody who might be remotely interested in a more story propelled shooter title, focused on an alternative WWII timeline. In any case, have fun gamers, enjoy the review, and let me know if I can help with anything!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2014"}

Especially, when you don't have the system for it at first, but get it at a later date. Well, anyway that has started to become a constant for Nintendo. They have started to reissue some of their most classic games onto the Gamecube, and Game Boy Advance. Still, that does make it into a whole new game. The Mario Brothers legacy has remained that constant. The brothers celebrated their 20th anniversary last year, since the first Mario Brothers game 1983, and a whole lot of players in regions from all over the world. Yet, although their story remains easy now, it always comes back as a fan-based groove for many people all over the world.Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World, is a real surprise, as one of the first Super Nintendo games, put upon the Game Boy shelves. What makes this game work so well, as a new introduction to the Game Boy Advance. The game was a big smash before, and yet nothing else has changed to the advance, but the gameplay. The game features 9 different worlds, and the debut of Yoshi. In this game, Bowser is at his old tricks again, and you and Luigi, and Yoshi have to encounter all different kinds of outrageous feats, and courses, which really test your strength and skill. Although it is nothing new if you've played it, and beat it for the Super Nintendo system, you only get it again, because you haven't played it for so long, and need the groove again. The graphics are beautiful, and just keep showing promise in its prime, and the enemies also keep getting harsher, including Renzor, the Koopa Kids, which made their debut in Super Mario 3, and a whole lot more than meets the eye. It gets exciting with time passing, but also a feel of the plumber has sat true here.All in all, the game remains as a classic for Nintendo buffs, and is a must have all over again.

Games seemed to be rich and vibrant with a level of depth that was never seen before. One day when I was at my local game store they were showing off a new game that was released which had a woman running around with dual pistols. The name of this game was Tomb Raider and after many incarnations Square Enix has thrown their hat into the ring and come up with a remastering of this franchise. But is this a trip that you'll want to take or would you rather stay home?Lara Croft is still the main character in this game but she is not known all over the world just yet. In this game she is starting out in the world on a ship called the Endurance but a freak storm has her and the crew shipwrecked on a tropical island. Now instead about making her mark in the world she has to focus on survival and finding survivors from the wreck. Unlike other games where you are placed in a linear go from point a to point b fashion, Tomb Raider is an open world. The island is ripe for exploration as you will have to find water and food to survive. Lara is not the only inhabitant on the island however as there are a slew of enemies ranging from wild animals to various other inhabitants on the island.This game has something that will please almost every gamer as there are bits of RPG elements (such as crafting, levelling up certain skills, etc), exploration of the lush tropical paradise and of course there is combat ranging from crude weapons to guns that can be found on certain enemies on the island. The whole game takes around 12 to 15 hours to complete the single player campaign but there are other things to do such as side quests, challenge tombs (hidden areas that are puzzles but lead to great treasure) and there is even a multiplayer mode where two teams of four square off against one another on various maps.

It took on a different formula from the popular military shooters such as Call of Duty, Battlefield and Ghost Recon series.I always like the stealth aspect of the Splinter Cell series but the previous installments were a huge departure from it. Blacklist is a welcomed return to the stealth, which makes you plan your strategy carefully to take advantage of the environment in order to succeed in each mission, instead of using the usual run-and-gun approach.This game is very challenging because of the smarter enemy A.I. You get to experiment with different play styles between gun blazing and stealth attacks. You die a lot if you are not careful with your approaches. I would say this is one of the hardest games I play recently. However, it's very rewarding and satisfying when you manage to complete a mission. Furthermore, there are tons of upgrades and customizations that you earn throughout the game.Graphics and animation is fluid and the campaign story is interestingly believable. Voice acting is spot on (with M-rated language).The classic \"Spies vs Mercenaries\" multiplayer mode is back and it is surprisingly fun. The MP is well balanced even with the asymmetrical gameplay (first-person Mercs vs third-person Spies).The co-op consists of 14 side missions and is a lot of fun as well. Enemies seldom react in the same way and different play styles lead to different outcomes. That's a lot of replay value in it.I really enjoy Splinter Cell Blacklist. The campaign, co-op and multiplayer are all fun to play. I think it's the best Splinter Cell game to date. I would highly recommend this game if you like shooters but appreciate a stealth approach.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2013"}

The presentation is amazing. There are few games that are in UC2's league for visuals (Killzone, MW2, RE5). The gameplay is more platformer than action game with lots of climbing and jumping. It's a treasure hunting story that does follow a very linear patch, but also offers some of the best voice acting and character interaction that I can remember seeing in a game.I have to point out that I don't undersand why games like Metal Gear and Resident Evil force horrible control schemes on you. UC2 has proven that you can have strong shooting mechanics, a good cover system and allow a lot of interaction with the environments without feeling stiff or unresponsive. Although graphics and dialouge get a lot of attention in this game, the controls steal the show. Hopping from ledge to ledge, running and gunning, chucking grenades is all too easy. Also, more than any game ever (I'm looking at you MGS), UC2 let's you control the set pieces. Never before has a game created a hollywood style action piece where you are controlling things so easily.Review#2I'm a online shooter fanatic and have logged hundreds of hours on MW and KZ. Most new games tack on a forced multiplayer mode. Uncharted has to be commended for including an awesome and fully fleshed out online co-op and competitive mode. The online portion is far above average for an online shooter, but I think the statements that this could be a stand alone shooter are overstated. There are levels and unlocks, as has become the norm, but it not in the league of MW or KZ. The shooting mechanics are good, but not good enough to stop people from migrating to MW2 in a month. It's an excellent diversion, but the campaign mode is where UC truly shines.In all, Uncharted 2 has one of the best single player modes of this generation and coupled with a solid online component make this triple A title a must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

It is really action packed and every moment is filled with excitements and its all captured in the best visuals you will see on a console. They didn't just take advantage of having awesome graphics, they captured it all in beautiful scenary. The animation is the best yet and filled with great voice acting that gives it such a cinematic experience.With that said, how is the gameplay? It is fun and fluid. The pace hardly ever slows down and when it does, its for a short breather. It plays just like the first game. It doesn't do anything really new. It just does everything like the first one but ten times bigger. The single-player experience is great and then there is the multiplayer component that is not exactly neccessary on a game that delivers such a good single player experience. There are many modes that it offers like standard deathmatch, plunder which is team's fighting to capture a piece of treasure similar to capture the flag, and such.The game is a must own for PS3 owners. It is a game worth getting a PS3 for! It might not do much new but it delivers one of the most polished experiences you will play. It feels like a adventure. I highly recommend getting this game. You will NOT be disappointed.I complete all my games prior to review. You can take my opinion as that from the whole game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

The game is definately intense and fast paced, and compared to older TM games is quite a bit more difficult.  I would definately recommend this game as it is alot of fun to play.  Getting the secret characters and levels proves to be a real challenge.  Also, with a about 15 different cars, all with different handeling and physics, there is plenty of reply value here.  Additionally, I love the fact that the levels are interactive and that they can be destroyed or manipulated.My only complaints about this game is that there is a very steep learning curve.  The game is very fast and the controls are quite difficult to get used to, especially if you play other driving games.  Secondly, it can occasionally get annoying when all of your enemies gang up on you, all the skill in the world wont help you here.Just as a warning, the game is rated M and is quite a bit darker and more violent than past TM games, which in my opinion makes it far better as I hate when games are dumbed down for kids.The graphics on this game are great, the levels are impeccably created and designed.  They frequent use of the black/grey/brown color pallets give the atmosphere are dark seedy feel which is awesome.  The music itself isnt bad, I generally tend to keep the music of games pretty low as I am an MVC2 fan and as many of you know the music to that game is an atrocity.Finally in my experiance, if I am playing more than one game consecutively in a day, I try not to play this one before another driving game.  For instance when I play GTA after playing TM Black, I get bored very quickly as the driving in GTA or Midnight Club is so sluggish compared to TM Black.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

Once I got past the \"tutorial levels\" this game quickly turned into one of my favorites. There are a lot of things that still annoy me about it though. Repetitiveness of missions, sloppy combat, and overall mechanics to name a few. However this game makes up for it in story.This was the first in a series of great games. Every game in the series has improved upon the other each time. The graphics in this game are top notch and still hold up overtime. The combat and controls take some time to get used to but once you have it everything works out and this becomes a pretty entertaining game.If you are looking to break away from the over-saturation of FPS games on the market today give this series a shot.

I normally play if from August all the way through the Super Bowl, which means I really get my money's worth. But this particular game here....I played it for two months and could not take it anymore. This game is beyond dreadful, now for the specifics.RUNNING THE BALL:When I play with a back like Chris Johnson or Adrian Peterson, I gain 300 yards per game on all-pro difficulty. Yeah, that's realistic. I make one juke move and I'm gone. When the CPU runs the ball against me, they get somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 yards by half-time. I have watched the CPU run a simple draw play up the middle on instant replay and noticed my entire defensive line get knocked over at once. CPU averages 5 yards a carry, no matter who the RB is.PASSING THE BALL:The only passes I can complete are drags, deep crossing patterns, and slants. If I try a simple curl route, pass gets picked off everytime..everytime, no exceptions. It's almost as if the CPU DB runs the route for the receiver. If I try a play action pass, the entire DL is on my QB before I get a chance to complete the ball fake. Whenever CPU throws a deep pass, the receiver jumps up and comes down with it, no matter what his skill rating is. Yelp, that makes sense. And oh yeah, every game has a final score of 42-35, 56-49, you get the picture.MISCELLANEOUS:Someone seems to get injured on every single kickoff return. Off-line franchise mode continues to get ignored by EA. There is no training camp, player progression, or practice mode in franchise. I guess Madden 12 will do away with preseason all together. What ever happened to cool stuff like \"lead blocker\" and using the right stick to truck/elude defenders?If you've played Madden 11 for any extended period of time, you know what I'm talking about for the most part. I honestly liked Madden 10, it was playable. I REALLY wanted to like this game. I tweaked sliders, changed skills settings etc, etc. If I have to do all that just to make a game playable, it's not worth it. If you are a casual football fan, you may not pick up on or care about any of the things I've listed. But, if you've been playing Madden for years like me, this game is a huge let down.I hate this game and will not be buying another football game until another company is allowed to compete with EA and make a better game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2011"}

I have been a fan of pokemon since the old red, blue, and yellow versions for gameboy.  This game makes them look like glitched up things of the past.  Here's my opinionated scoop on the bad and the good of this game, in that order.The Bad:1.  Same old thing.  What I mean by this is, although the story has it's differences from other games, it's still basically the same idea.  You get to pick your first pokemon from: Turtwig (a grass type), Chimchar (a fire type), and Piplup (a water type).  Once you pick your first pokemon in a setup somewhat similar to the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald versions, you are off on a journey to basically be both the ultimate trainer, and the contest master.  You will meet a new, psychotic evil team, who has the wrong ideas about the pokemon world and such.  There is also the same goal of beating the elite four, and the return of that tedious training you must do to get past the gym leaders.  All I am saying, is this game will probably be a newer experience to those who are just getting to know pokemon.2.  It seems like the Pokemon company are starting to get low on ideas.  First off, long time pokemon gamers may notice they haven't introduced as many new pokemon as they did in Gold, Silver, and Crystal.  What's more, they even started intertwining old pokemon into the new games, just giving them different index numbers.  Of course, it's hard not to include the old pokemon when many of the new ones are either pre-evolutionary forms, or even evolved forms of them.  Cute and cool, but may not cut the mustard. Now don't get me wrong, there are some cool new pokemon (Piplup, for example, has become very popular among pokemon fans).  All I am saying is, the game designers seem to be digging in the bottom of the barrel.3.  The secret base system just isn't as good.  Now, I love the Underground!  The prospect of digging for fossils, heart scales, and other rare items appeals to me; but who here has played the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald versions?  In those versions, you can have secret bases in trees, in rock walls, and even in bushes, in any desirable route.  This game, not so much.  You have to have to create your base somewhere in the Underground.  Now, that may not be too bad for some, as you can create it wherever you want, provided you have the drilling tool.  BUT WHY DO THE STUPID ROCKS HAVE TO BE THERE?!  This is what really stinks; you can't move the rocks unless you capture someone elses flag.  I think in order to do that, you have to have Wi-Fi connection, and infiltrate somebody else's base to get their flag.  I have dial-up (because high speed can get expensive), and have heard Wi-Fi will not work with it, so I'm out of luck.  I'm stuck with the dumb unmovable rocks (that are always in the way), in a base that looks like everyone elses (except maybe with different decorations), that lacks variety in landscaping.4.  The Poketch (Another awkward name, but it stands for pokemon watch) could use a bit more work.  It's good if you only have a few things you can access from it.  However, when you get more things, you basically have to start tapping the screen like crazy to get what you want.  All I'm saying is a quick selection feature would have been nice.5.  Another annoying rival.  Long time pokemon gamers will know the type.  Pesky, bothering you at the wrong times, always beats you to the gymleaders even if it seems impossible that he did so, picks the starter that beats yours in type and boasts about it, and is supposedly a long time \"friend\" of yours.  Yeah, very irritating.6.  Getting the national pokedex is a bit of a pain.  Until you get it, you cannot rely on help from stronger pokemon in a couple of the older versions either.The Good:1.  Waaay more life-like!  This game is the most three dimensional of the pokemon hand-held games I have ever seen!  This makes it more life-like in some areas, as it makes you feel you're actually on the ground rather than in a hot air ballon, or something in the air, looking down on everything.2.  Time is more realistic.  This could also weave in with more life-like.  Rather than change instantly from day to night or vice versa at six, like in Gold Silver, and Crystal, or not at all (like the other pokemon games), Pokemon Diamond actually has day phases.  There is morning, afternoon, dusk, evening, and even late night!  Gameplay is good no matter what time you play!  The game also acknowledges days of the week (example: Drifloon comes to the windworks factory on Friday), though maybe that isn't used as much as it was in Gold, Silver, and Crystal.  All the same, it is a better and well-developed system.3.  They brought back the night guards!  It brings back fond memories of Gold, Silver, and Crystal, to have police men who will only fight you at night...4.  The gyms are better than ever!  Maybe a tad harder than I like, but the traps and stuff don't have a deja vu feel to them.  It's a totally new experience!5.  The Underground is awesome!  I enjoy digging up rare items and spheres!  The only thing I wish to warn is: don't dig to many spheres in the ground!  The older spheres will start disappearing if you bury too many spheres.6.  The contests have come back with a vengance!  Do you know those old contests in Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald?  You feed your pokemon pokeblocks in hopes the audience will like how it looks, then you try to outshine the others with moves in a period of four turns on a single judge.  Well, that kind of contest is now the thing of the past!  First off, instead of pokeblocks, players must feed their pokemon a food called poffin.  It's made of berrys still, but in a different way that uses the stylus.  It's like you cook your pokemon's food now.  Then there's the dancing, the accessory and poffin accented physical appeal, and rather than one, THREE judges you can appeal to!  Contests are now more difficult, fun, and entertaining!7.  More trainer card features!  You can actually sign your name in your own handwriting using the stylus on the back of your trainer's card!  You can also shine your badges, which do get dull!  I thought these were interesting and entertaining tidbits of the game.8.  The poketch is cool!  Yes, I complained about it not having a quick select feature in the bad; but regardless, this thing is still very cool and useful in the game!  Hidden item?  Throw away the item finder and use your dowsing app!  Forgot where you plant a berry?  Find the locations of pickable berrys with the berry finding app (that may not be what it's really called).  Chances are, if there's a feature you want your poketch to do, you will find it eventually.9.  The new pokemon are cool.  There aren't really enough new ones, and the ideas seem to be a bit... lacking in a couple of areas; but still, the new abilities, moves, and pokemon make for new and exciting gameplay.10.  I believe there are a lot of legendaries.  This means more rare pokemon for you (and a good deal of them are cute!)11.  This game is more \"people friendly\".  Quite often, you will team up with a character in the game who will heal your pokemon after each battle, and offer his or her pokemon for assistance in double battling format.  This is a great opportunity to learn to work with the pokemon that are not yours.  The only drawback, is that you will meet two wild pokemon at once.  If there is one you want, you can't catch it until you defeat the other pokemon.  In addition, your \"partner\" will attack every turn not knowing to let up.  On these facts, it is better to try and catch pokemon alone.12.  Animations are included, and there are many good details.  This time there are differences between male and female pokemon other than the symbol.  These differences are slight and difficult to tell, but it is good attention to detail.  On top of that, pokemon animations are included (example: Starly flaps its wings when you see it).  Another new good detail is being able to tell how much a pokemon weighs against yourself.13.  Taking care of berries is easier and more realistic!  Don't recall when you last watered that berry in Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald?  Well, now you can tell!  The soil actually changes to a light color when the berry plant hasn't been watered, so you know when to water it!  The only challenge that remains is being able to water it several times a day...So, that about raps it up.  Overall, this is an awesome game beyond belief!  If you want hours of entertainment, love pokemon, or even just enjoy playing videogames in general, then this is one of the best games you can buy out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2007"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"The best next-gen console","reviewText":"I do not see how a person can buy an Xbox 360 over PS3. I have never owned any Xbox console. Why? The joystick is too bulky, the 360 console burns out and the online has to be paid for. The PS3 is clearly the best. Why? Blu-ray format, reliability and free online access. Additionally, if you have an LCD TV, buy a HDMI cable!!! Tube owners need not apply. If you are looking to upgrade to a good, affordable and reliable LCD TV, I recommend aLG 37LG30 37-Inch 720p LCD HDTV. For the HDTV owners, the PS3 will recognize the cable and you will be prompted to go to full resolution (1080i). The graphics actually get improved. Just when you think the graphics couldn't get better, they do. Picture playing PS3 in full HD resolution!!! You cannot beat that. Sure, the 40GB is not backwards capable. Who really wants to play PS1 and PS2 games?! That is a thing of the past.Now, it is important to take care of the console. First, the PS3 must not be put in a entertainment center or any confined space. The game must be in an open space. Typically, during long periods of game play, the fan on the console will kick on and sound like a vacuum. Do not panic! The fan will go off, automatically. The console is just cooling itself off. Now, if the fan does not eventually go off, dust is probably built up in the system or it is being played in a confined space, such as an entertainment center. To get the dust out of the system, take the hose on a vacuum (if applicable) and clean the dust out with the vents! Do not do the so-called cleaning test, like those clowns on[...] suggests!!!! That tactic will eventually burn the game out. Of course, you will not have to worry about dust, until you have owned the game for a long period of time. If you play regularly, vacuum the vents, once a week. Since I bought my PS3 in February of 2008, I have had no problems. I did have it in an entertainment center and the console's fan was going off and wouldn't turn off. The console just did not have good ventilation. Overall, the game is superb and very reliable.

FF13(garbage) wasn't,  FF13-2 wasn't, and this isn't.  I yearn for a traditional FF game just as much as anyone else, but we are not getting one in the foreseeable future. Bummer. I know.OK. That being said, this is a drastic improvement to the FF13 mechanics. I will outline the game mechanics and clarify how they work.  It seems like people are dismissing the game because they feel overwhelmed. Reviewers are also complaining because the game is &#34;too difficult&#34; and the graphics don't blow them away. Personally I think the challenge level is just right and the graphics are irrelevant (but they look fine).- The Game Timer -  Yes there is a time limit to complete the quest. It is not as imposing as other reviewers would have you believe. At first I was pretty stressed by it, but now I own that timer and it answers only to me.  Here's how it works:  You have 5 points to spend at any given time.  For 1 point you can freeze time for awhile.  You can use this over and over to basically halt the clock permanently.  The points required to use this ability are gained by battling enemies. If you don't elude all the monsters you should be in pretty good shape.  Some interesting ways the timer is used is allowing certain areas, treasures, quests and enemies to be accessible at certain times.  The timer may not be the ideal mechanic for everyone, but it isn't the nightmare people are framing it as.Another tip is if you think the timer got the best of you, and the playthrough is going to be a bust, just sleep until the timer runs out and start a new game plus with all your stat increases and equipment.- You can also save time by teleporting.  It costs more points so I don't like it, but you can do it.- The battle system-  It is finally good in this game! FF13 was a disaster since it basically took most critical thinking out of the hands of the player.  It had a &#34;rinse repeat&#34; structure that they only managed to fix slightly in FF13-2. Now you have full decision making control again.  Essentially you customize 3 outfits with a variety of stats and skills and when you want to use the skills associated with the outfit you press the shoulder button to instantly change to that skill set.  There is no cost for doing this and it is very rapid and fluid. Each outfit has a designated amount of action points and when you use them up they refill (faster when the outfit is not active). This rewards players who have 3 meaningful loadouts because they won't need to wait long to take action in battle.  The game is &#34;difficult&#34; if you do not actually learn how to properly fight your enemies. I know it is a living tragedy, but you may need to save your game regularly and reload when necessary.  The horror!-Customization and character growth: Much of the strategy comes from customizing your costume loadouts. Most outfits have permanent skills and a few slots to equip your own.  The skills themselves can be combined, upgraded and leveled.  Weapons can also be enhanced later. Basically you want to make sure you have some balance with your abilities and when you enter new areas tweak as needed.Character stat progression comes from quest completion instead of fighting enemies. This is how the game answers all those people who complain about grinding. Monster fights exist to accumulate, wealth, item drops and points that allow special abilities (like time freeze).  I think the approach was an effective one, albeit unconventional.  People who hate side quests may not like this but the highest stat boosts actually come from completing main quests.-Exploration-  This game has a fairly open world.  After the early story segments you can basically travel anywhere.  This can be overwhelming but if you apply time saving tactics it should not be that bad. Just remember to fight enemies and freeze time/teleport.  Always talk to people and accept whatever quests are available to avoid backtracking.  The game helps with this since NPCs that are quest related have a star by their name.-Story- it's alright.  The other two had pretty convoluted stories so this is no exception.  It may be a bit more grounded, but that's not saying a lot.  Overall the world of FF13 is lost in its own mythos.-Conclusion: This game has a lot of merit even though it isn't a traditional FF game. It has a fantastic battle/customization system which is one of the main things that has been lacking in the FF13 series.  People who are complaining right now are largely not understanding the flow of the gameplay or have not given it a chance.  The developers gave the player the necessary tools to deal with the challenges.  Square cured several things that the general gaming population (not me) have been complaining about (random battles, grinding, linearity).  Unfortunately it seems that some people can't handle the medicine. I can see why this game is so divisive but it's worth giving an honest effort before you pass final judgment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2014"}

However, there are some problems with the game. First of all, some missions have to be done over and over again, sometimes 20-50 times before you can go on (while others can be finished on 1 or 2 tries). The graphics are about on par with a last-generation PS1 game which makes you miss some of the obstacles and causes more frustration. The cars seem to flip over at the drop of a hat, ending the mission, and rarely can go above 80 miles an hour. The drone cars on the streets have absolutely no AI, and like to get in your way just to be a pain. Despite all this though, the game is very original and can be a lot of fun at times, but you will probably spend more time cursing like a sailor than enjoying this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2002"}

RB6: Vegas is a lot of fun though.  There are a few shortcomings, but they don't detract from the game's overall value.As mentioned by at least one other reviewer, the save points in the Single player mode a bit too far apart.  I've had the game for a week and I'm stuck on a particular level.  I get oh so close to the end, only to be killed.  Another minor gripe is the fact that there are only 2 difficulty settings, and the easiest is not easy by any means.  I've seen no way to repair your health mid-level (no med packs, nothing), and it doesn't take many hits for you to die.  Combine that with the infrequent checkpoints and you will run into some frustrating moments.  An omission that I found to be glaring is that the M4 assault rifle, probably the most used by special forces teams next to the MP5, is not to be found.The enemy and your team AI are both superb.  Enemies will take cover, flank you, snipe you, etc.  They communicate with each other when one of them spots you as well.  Your teammates are also fantastic.  Controlling their actions is very easy.  I've yet to run into a situation where one of them gets stuck on something (like a trying to walk through a wall or something stupid like that).  They're also good to use to do a lot of the dirty work, and man do they work effeciently!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Suprisingly addictive","reviewText":"I have had limited experience with the Burnout series.  The only time I've even played a Burnout game was with a free Demo of Burn out Revenge.  With the abundance of average and downright bad racing games out there, I didn't expect much of the demo, but I actually found it quite entertaining and fun.  Usually I expect some sort of realism in racing games, but Burnout Revenge was the exception, after a while I found myself playing the demo more than the game that the demo was included on.  As much fun as I had with the Burnout Revenge demo, I never got around to getting the full game.  Then after awhile, I forgot about it all together.A few years later I got the opportunity to get a copy of Burnout Paradise City.  I was expecting more of the same as compared to Burnout revenge, and for the most part it is still the same type of game, but there are a few disappointments.First off there is no \"Crash Breaker\" in Paradise.  I seem to recall in the Revenge Demo, I would sometime be able to break out of a crash by a perfectly timed button press; however this feature is no longer available.  Why it was taken out is beyond me, I suppose they wanted the game to be more \"realistic\".  Secondly there is no after touch either which was also in Revenge.  When you crash in Paradise the computer takes over and you are no longer in control.Another disappointment is the extremely cumbersome and confusing menus.  Whoever designed the menus needs a class in user interface design.  When someone is playing a game for the first time or the first time in quite a while, the last thing they want to deal with is confusing menus making the game needlessly more frustrating; when all they want to do is to figure out how to do something.  A menu design should be a simple as pressing Start or Select and scrolling down to what you want to do, it does not require much more than that and I wish game companies would realize that most of us don't care about how \"cool\" the menu system is.  They need to stop trying so hard and get back to the basics.Despite the negatives, Burnout Paradise is still a fun game to play.  I was so turned off by the menu system, that I didn't play it again for a couple of days, but I came back to it after letting my son play it for about 20 minutes.  He seemed to really enjoy it and after playing it for the second time I started to enjoy it as well.The graphics are very well done, the first thing I thought about when I played this game on my main TV in the living room were the racing games we see in video arcades.  The graphics are that good.  The city that you drive in looks downright real; better than PGR3.  The gas stations and repair shops all over the city are also authentic looking and the gas stations in the game even have today's inflated prices.  In addition the cars YOU drive are also quite convincing in the realism department.  While they are not actual licensed cars, they are still designed very well and the damage they sustain is realistic.  The only area in graphics that could use improvement are the NPC cars.The audio is also great.  From the engine sounds to the sounds of screeching tires and the inevitable crashes, add a great deal of excitement to the game.  Additionally, if you drive on the wrong side of the road or about to hit a passing car head on, you will hear the cars honk at you.  For best results it's good to have the volume cranked up to get the best effect.Presentation is a big part of all games and that alone determines if a game is good or bad; at least in my book.  For the most part Paradise delivers.  This game's presentation is quite similar to Need For Speed : Underground in which you are given free roam of the city with no blocked off areas or linear routes in actual racing.  If you want to drive off a cliff, you can.  In addition not only do you have to contend with traffic while you are cruising you also have to deal with them during actual events.  So not only do you have to worry about beating your opponents, you also have to worry about weaving through slow traffic.  Unlike PGR3, your computer controlled opponents WILL crash and are not \"unwreckable\". In fact one of the points of the game is to wreck your opponents.Another fun thing about the game is that you are free to race whenever YOU want to; both during free roam as well as actual races.  Similar to GTA if you just want to drive around the city wrecking other cars and doing stunts all day you can.  But when you do decide to race, there are over 100 \"events\" you can compete in all over the city and in categories such as \"Street Race\", \"Marked Man\", \"Stunt Run\", and \"Road Rage\".  All events are fun, but some are understandably more difficult than others.  The presentation is done well enough to keep me interested for a while. However on a side note, I never knew cars could drive themselves.  There are no drivers in your and any of the other cars in Paradise so that is pretty lame, but if you can look past that you still should be able to have fun playing.By no means can this game be considered realistic by any stretch of the imagination.  Things are way too easy to do like pressing X will allow you to perform a perfect E-brake turn every single time, and not even in PGR3 can I make a sharp turn at 120 MPH without crashing.  But the important thing is that this game is fun to play for me.  In the long run I do see it getting a little repetitive, but for now it keeps my son and me entertained.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2008"}

THis is some of the best cooperative play I have ever experienced.  Of course a deathmatch or team-deathmatch style is offered, cooperative is my favorite.  There are other game types as well, including hostage resues, bomb disarmings, and escorts where the other team has to prevent a pilots escape and sometimes YOU are the pilot.  All in all, taking out terrorists with online pals is the most rewarding.  The game has an excellent interface that automatically downloads new maps, textures, and sounds when you join a new server that is playing a new map. Its so easy to use.If youre not into multiplayer or have a bad internet connection, perhaps this title isnt for you.
