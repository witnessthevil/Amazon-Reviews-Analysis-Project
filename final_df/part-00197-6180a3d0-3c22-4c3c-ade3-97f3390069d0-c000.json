{"product_name":"B0000664JE","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"Packs A Wallop, But Seriously Flawed","reviewText":"If Dead to Rights was a movie, you can bet your lucky stars that Mission: Impossible and the other big action movie rejects would be shuffling along the sidewalk in their bathrobe. Namco's latest bullet riddled action title is one of the most cinematic, action packed over-the-top action games I've ever played. The entire game's adrenaline barometer is clicking at full tilt and doesn't dare slow down to lose that eccentric sensation of pulse inducing gun fights that make us feel like Bruce Willis in Die Hard; and its that quality that makes Dead to Rights a worthwhile game, flaws and all.Yes, Jack Slate (The main hero/good cop/framed man) is a [copy] of Remedy's Max Payne, he plays more like a reject from the drawing board of Bruce Willis wannabe's. Yes, his one liners are cheesy and he fires them off like there's no tomorrow, not to mention his bullet-time/slow motion dive looks odd. Okay, okay yeah, Jack Slate is a complete retard, but when you shrug off that silly smirk off your face, you'll find yourself clenching your burly Xbox controller and indulged in a piece of action gaming bliss. Dead to Rights takes place in a fictional setting \"Grant City\", Jack Slate is a wise-ass officer who's father is killed (Of course) and he in turn is framed for murder and gets caught up in a dangerous web of corrupt cops, city officials and more gun fights that Clint Eastwood's even seen. Yeah, the story's not going to win any awards, nor was it meant to, thankfully Namco shifts it focus off the story and more onto the game rather than the heavily story driven roots of ones such as its inspiration Max Payne.Now that the small talk is out of the way, let's talk action. Dead to Rights best feature is the never-before seen action elements that have been perfectly implemented into the gameplay. Jack can disarm foes barehanded, grab enemies and use them as human bullet shields, use his dog to attack enemies and fight hand to hand if things come to worse (which they will). Now before you criticize, believe me these are not some of the useless features in games, all of these elements give players strategy that seriously helps pull you out of dire straights.Dead to Rights also is littered with mini-games. Surprisingly many of them are fun and add great depth to the action feel, especially when you're disarming bombs and one false move will blow you to smithereens. Others range from arm wrestling, to weight lifting, resisting torture, picking locks andBut where there's the good, there's always the bad lurking off in the corners somewhere; and I say this loud and clear: Dead to Rights is the most challenging, most difficult and sometimes cheapest game I've played all year. It's nearly impossible to play without getting pissed off and it nearly kills the fun factor too. Only play this if you're comfortable blowing your top often as well as dying often because you'll be doing a hell of a lot of it here. Without difficulty settings that are sorely needed in a game like this, you'll be dying many times even on the second and third levels. The biggest problem is hand to hand combat, the fighting system may seem cool at first, but surprisingly every part that I got angry at was a fighting part. I had no trouble overcoming the imposing odds in gun fights, but in hand to hand you're only given one defensive option to work with, and that's block, only thing is, the block doesn't work. Most annoying is the fact that your enemies swarm you relentlessly and their hits do about half the damage of yours. A few bosses can even kill you in mere seconds, one example was a convict in prison eight punches from him will kill you where as it will take nearly fifty to bring him down (He also has two invulnerable sidekicks constantly attacking you to just to make things more cheap.)Don't expect this game to go easy on you even in the beginning, Dead to Rights won't spare anyone, not to mention some of the hardest boss fights ever, and I mean damn hard. This is another game that a difficulty setting could have promised this game the same stature of Max Payne, but alas laziness must have taken over, if there was a wake-up call to add difficulty settings, this is it. Yet even with its high frustration level however Dead to Rights is a hard as nails, action filled package just bursting at the seems with style and flair, so I am giving it thumbs up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZD18","reviewerName":"theshonen8899","summary":"Not even close to ready.","reviewText":"They might as well have delayed the launch and focused on getting the product to overseas backers first instead of doing this flaky retail launch.ControllerThis controller is a mixed bag. The sand-blasted aluminum has a great feel and texture. The face buttons are clicky and the analog sticks move smoothly. My post launch controller did not have the problem of getting stuck under the face plates. Also, for some reason the controller does not turn the console on. This is annoying considering every modern console controller has this functionality.TriggersUnfortunately that's where my praise ends, as this controller is really quite horrible. The triggers make a horrible screech and feel cheap and toy-like. They also require quite a bit of pressure to push down and the slimy glossy texture doesn't feel reassuring. They feel most similar to the GameCube's triggers but those don't make the screeching noises and are far more comfortable and easy to push down. The bumpers aren't any good either. For some reason the bumpers are curved downwards, making it very difficult to reach up and push them solidly. I suspect this was done in order to have a place for you to rest your finger, but it just makes pushing the bumpers much harder.Analog SticksThe analog sticks for the most part feel just like you'd expect from a PS3 or Xbox controller and glide nice and smooth. However, the texture on the analog sticks themselves are not at all grippy and my fingers tend to slip off them constantly. They're hard, slippery, and feel terrible. If you insist on using this controller, buy some Grip-it analog stick covers and that'll fix it.TouchpadThis thing is garbage. It's incredibly small and doesn't have any indication of where the touchpad begins and ends. It's also incredibly twitchy and not precise. Using this on a browser or in Android is a nightmare. I just plug in a mouse and never use it, it's really that bad.ValueFor $50 this controller is a joke. Supposing we ignore the incredible shortcomings of this controller, the controller doesn't even feature rumble, cables, or rechargeable batteries, all things you get from a cheaper PS3 controller. Perhaps there will be games that actually use the touchpad to good effect. But for now, I have not seen it and the PS3 controller has been far superior in my experience. I cannot guarantee 100% game compatibility, but the PS3 controller is the way to play on the Ouya.Using a PS3 controllerKeep in mind however that if you use the PS3 controller, you will not be able to use the Sixaxis app to play games without gamepad support. This was one of the big reasons I bought the Ouya and I had hoped to play a lot of my Play Store content with the Sixaxis app. However, when you connect the controller to the Ouya, the console immediately formats the controller with it's own Ouya emulation driver. This is nice because it gives it compatibility with Ouya games, but it also stops functioning as a PS3 controller. You can easily connect it by usb to your PS3 and reset the driver by clicking the reset button on the back, but you won't be able to pair it to the Ouya console. The problem is that the bluetooth connection on the Ouya just doesn't work like a normal Bluetooth chip. You can't pair the PS3 controller like you would on a smartphone or tablet, it just won't work as anything other than an Ouya controller connection.ConsoleThe console looks nice enough and the sand-blasted aluminum they used for the console and controller look and feel great. It comes with an ethernet port (rare for Android devices) and a convenient micro-usb that makes side-loading, adb, recovery, ROMs and all other Android goodness wonderfully easy.Connection ProblemsBy far the worst experience I've had with the Ouya was first setting it up. It's a fairly straight forward process but the restrictions are the worst part. To actually use the console you must set up an account with a credit card or Ouya point card. I spent three days repeatedly entering in my credit card information and it would repeatedly say it couldn't reach the server.Let me make this clear. The console I bought was useless unless I gave them my credit card number, and even when I did it wouldn't accept it. Nevermind the fact that I shouldn't have to give out my credit card information just to use the console, the servers were so bad that they wouldn't even accept it. I cannot fathom why they would do this considering every game is suppose to be free to try, but it made my Ouya setup a nightmare.UIThe menu is minimalistic to a fault. There are tons of screen real estate wasted and the colors and blocky print make the whole UI look cheap. The store doesn't show the game's price, the game library is cramped and hard to navigate through. The built in browser is based on the ICS stock browser but terribly difficult to use with a controller, more so than on Steam Big Picture or even on the PS3. I'm not sure why they insisted on deviating so much from stock Android, but it certainly hasn't been for the better. Side-loading Nova launcher or Open launcher makes the UI feel much more open and less claustrophobic to use, and with a little tweaking you can get a nice wallpaper with all your icons exactly where you want them.GamesThere are games like TowerFall and Dub Wars that show the potential and innovation that comes out of a indie friendly open console. Then there are games like Shadowgun, Dead Trigger, and Ravensword that show the ugly, ripoff side of an open console. As of right now the games have no manifested into any kind of decent experience I would recommend even at the low price of $100.Though I really want to support the Ouya and it's philosophy, the reality is that we already have an incredibly supportive indie platform with hundreds of great indie games. It's called Steam. And with Sony's recent drive to support indies on PS4 and PS Vita, I just don't see where the Ouya fits. Yeah, it's cheap, but it's also impossible to find in GameSpot, Target, or BestBuy, which is exactly what they promised. I can see the potential for this to become a mainstream indie platform for kids that's widespread and easy to use. But it's not widespread and based on my experience, not at all easy to use.My hope is that Ouya can hit the mainstream kids crowd. With the next generation consoles launching at $300-$500, parents need an affordable console that will be supported for years to come. They need a console that provides small, fun, and creative experiences for their kids. I'm hoping more games like TowerFall and Dub Wars are brought to the Ouya. I'm also hoping they make the console UI more beautiful and easy to use, and that they target retail much more aggressively.Until then, this console makes for a great hacker's box, but a poor game console.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}

Bioware does everything that they usually do. They have a evolving story told with a branching storyline just like their other titles such as Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, and such. The story is told uniquly by giving you the choice to be a elf, dwarf, or human to play throught the story but each one has some distinct differences starting off with their own origin story that gives each playthough for the first 45 minutes something different from the other characters to choose from. Each character is even more defined by picking their class be it a warrior, rogue, or mage. While playing through the game you meet up with many characters that will be a part of your party. Some will be typically nice but you have a couple that standout from the rest with their more devilish attitudes.Now the game looks good but nothing to awe at. The sites though are very impressive and each one can look pretty unique from the underground kingdom of the dwarves to the frosty mountainside. The downside is the animations and details in the dialogue scenes but it looks good enough in combat. The combat is fun and tight. There is different abilities you can gain which could enhance your speech to be more persuasive, there is the ability to gain more skill to unlock more difficult chests, and enhance your combat skills via new abilities. Combat is swift and fun to pull off but your character on occasion needs to move around at a certain angle at times when other party members of yours are bashing on a enemy. Prepare for some micro managing. It can be hectic but if done well enough, you can have some major positive outcomes. Your party members are usually pretty decent to take care of themselves and you can manage them not jus manually but also via menu to have them to be defensive, aggresive, and such.Now the dialogue tree here is pretty amazing and its done very uniquely in what your set out to do to fight the blight which is demons trying to pretty much take over. You will have be out to try to recruit help and your outcome through what you say during those attempts will change who will become your allies against the fight. There is some major different outcomes that can come out of all of this even up to the very ending. Its story is intriguing by all the outcomes that can come throughout the game. It is easy to play through and is filled will tons of weapons, items, and such that you can gain. You will be able to make your own potions, traps, poisons, and such if you have the skills necessary to do so.I highly recommend this game. It had exceeded my expectations. It is great and has a lot of replay value by having the ability to have different outcomes througout the story. Some decision making by what to day during some of the dialogue trees have took me some time to think what I want to do. It is impressive. It is engaging.

But when a rival agency enters the scene it's war, and only the best man will be left standing.","reviewerName":"PS2 Bruce","summary":"Excellent-But I have One Major Problem With It","reviewText":"I have been playing the \"hitman\" games since the original PC versions, and once I switched my gaming to consoles, have played \"contracts\" on PS2, and now \"Blood Money\" on the 360. This game is a great evolution of the series, keeping a lot of the good points (you have the choice of completing the level how you wish) fixing some of the problems, (interface and inventory use), and giving us all new levels to explore and do killing on. I have only ONE complaint, which I will get to in a bit.I know this might sound bad, but I really love killing games. They provide a great stress relief, from those days that are just so tough to get through, But be assured, I don't go roaming with my real pistol or get in my real car and try to mow people down, etc. My (fun) violence is on the TV screen only :0)With that said, my favorite part of the hitman games is still present, i.e. the ability to choose how to complete the \"contract.\" There are multiple ways to accomplish each kill. You can carefully sneak around for hours in real time, hiding from gaurds, slipping into where the target is when he/she is alone, poisoning a drink, strangling from behind, or, just shoot them in the face and run like hell. It's all up to you--what I usually do is sneak through the level first, to see where everyone is, then, once it's finished, play through a second time killing everybody in sight, for the \"mass murderer\" label, hehe. But you have to be careful, \"run and gun\" in the wrong spot and you WILL be killed, and one thing that gets old is the slow motion dying scene, but oh, well.As far as a minor complaint, the \"newspaper\" at the end of levels is cool, but agraviting to a point; it shows what you supposedly did on the mission such as \"Tycoon killed at compound; police looking for leads,\" etc. One thing I don't like is the paper is repetitive, including publishing things that didn't happen, for example on every mission it says something like \"and 3 people were shot in the head, making authorities concerned about the viciousness of the attack,\" but on one level i did absoluste stealth, ONLY killed the mark, did not harm anyone else, and didn't fire a shot! Oy! So who shot those three people in the head?Next, the only big complaint I have this time around is the save system. The way it works is, you are able to have in game saves (except for the most difficult level), for example on \"normal\" i think you can have six saves, anywhere you choose, BUT, the saves are in MEMORY, not to disc, so if you quit before the level is finished the saves are lost and you have to play the level from the start again. Argggghhhh! If the level is finished, it's added to the main menu to give you the choice of playing it again, and your game auto save continues from that point. I miss the way it worked in \"silent assasin\" where, the saves were to disc, and you could return to them whenever you wished. But, oh well.....In short I would recommend this game. If you have played hitman before you will really like it, if you are new to the series, it's probably the best one to start with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"A. Saenz","summary":"Best online experience on current generation (PS3 version)","reviewText":"My review's title is kind of relative, because not everyone will agree.Battlefield for dummy:Lets start by defining what is Battlefield and what is Call of duty, since many people tries to compare them just because both are FPS and have a modern warfare theme when this comparison is wrong. Battlefield, since PC, focused on to be a tactical shooter with strength direction in teamwork and teamplay, where Call Of Duty is more like an arcade run-and-shoot shooter where you do play in teams (multiplayer speaking) but you don't need to rely on them in order to play the game and win.Now, let's review the game.Story (8.6):+ Story locations and environments+ Good story telling- Unoriginal story- Character jokes (they are not funny, very childish to me)Battlefield started to introduce a story campaign since Bad Company 1, before it the game was multiplayer only on PC, still the campaign is not as deep in term of story telling as COD4, MW2 or Uncharted2. It surpasses the first bad company but, Battlefield's strongest points are in multiplayer modes, DICE did a great job. What adds a lot of value to the story are the environments and graphics, the selected game locations are spectacular.Graphics (9.0):+ More Drawing objects than its prequel+ Better textures than its prequel+ Destructible objects- Jaggies- Lightning and shadows (Multiplayer)I have the PS3 version and the game looks very good, definitely not the best on the console (Uncharted 2, 1, Killzone2 and MGS4 have better graphics) but still one of the best in terms of what third party companies can offer.Technically speaking, the game do has jaggies, and the lighting and shadow effects in multiplayer aren't as good as in the campaign; though the textures are better than BC1, there are more objects on screen than BC1 as well. As a personal preference, I do prefer BC2 overall graphics over Modern Warfare 2.Presentation (9.9):+ Campaign added to Bettlefield formula.+ Multiplayer modes+ Classes system and perks+ Free extra MP maps- Little issues when creating parties.As a whole package, BC2 offers a lot. Campaign adds a lot of value to the final product, but what takes the slice of cake is multiplayer mode, you will be satisfy only with RUSH and CONQUEST mode because you don't really need more.The only issue I have regarding the presentation is that randomly I cannot join a friend's party/squad in Play with a friend mode.Gameplay (9.8)+ Aiming+ Vehicles (Battlefield's trademark)+ Teamwork and teamplay- Squad size- Inter squad communicationI can't say anything wrong about controls, aiming or that kind of stuff, because Battlefield is solid in those aspects, what I do complain though is about the size of the squad (console version), I was addicted to BF:2142 where the squad maximum size was of 8 members, I could not complain about this if the game at least offered an inter squad communication system that lets more than 2 squads communicate with each other. It is frustrating to see n00b teammates run ala lone wolf and stealing your vehicles when you are repairing them, there is no way to guide them and tell them what not to do.Sound (9.9)+ All sounds- No classic battlefield them in the game :(Everything in terms of sound is great, my only complain is that the classic Battlefield's theme is missing and its replaced with a new one, that its good but not great as the old one.CONCLUSION:As a big fan of Battlefield 2142 (PC), I do miss the turrets and the voice system, still I really like the pick up the controller and play thing that offers the consoles. This game is to be played with friends, you will have a blast team working with friends, even if you loose a round or two, the game is satisfying and great in every aspect, not perfect, cuz no game is perfect. I really recommend it if you like tactical shooters and teamplay because these are key elements in battlefield, if you are a new comer getting its way from MW2, be prepare, you will have a learning curve, because COD is not focused on team play, but I'm sure, once the game gets into it, you will love it and will not want to go back to COD, more if you have friends to play this game with.FOR NOOBS:Do not steal your other teammates vehicles when they get out of to fix them, you are not supporting the team this way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

It has the same addictive gameplay and strategic missions of the first, but they are noticeably easier and shorter to complete. VC1 would often have me playing a mission several times to successfully clear it. This one is a breeze to finish first play-through. That is a bit disappointing, along with the trivial story and silly characters this time around. On the bright side, it is a very long game you will spend many hours with. It seems perfect for the PSP because you can play in short amounts if you're on the go, save whenever you want (except during battles), then turn it off when you're at your destination. I also liked how main characters Alicia and Welkin from the first game made a surprise appearance in here, not as playable characters, but just some updated scenes on their lives now.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"THE DEVIL IN THE CORPORATION","reviewText":"Even if I was a great fan of the originalDiabloandD2, I was late in deciding to take D3 on. It was a combination of factors, from the bad reviews the game kept getting, to the constant servers errors I kept hearing about and to me being too busy to take up such a time-eater. However, I came across it at a great discount and, on an impulse, decided to give it a try. Three weeks of (casual) gameplay later this is what I think.DIABOLICALLY GORGEOUSThe game is beautiful to look at and a visual pleasure to play in. The environments are meticulously rendered and yet they loose none of their details when zoomed in or acted upon. Blowing up tree trunks or exploding bodies of enemies is both fun and physically accurate. Sure, some heads or pieces of wood can be seen to spin for too long, but that is part of the game's appeal, right? You are become Death, the destroyer of Worlds!YOUR CHORD SOUNDS FAMILIARThe sounds are better than the music but they are both quite well made. What I found strange was that, at least once, throughout Act I, the background music clearly reminded me of the main theme fromBaldur's Gate. Let's chalk this one off as ...tribute.GRINDING BUILDS CHARACTER.The bad news is that it builds exactly the same kind of character for everyone. There are no choices when leveling up. Everything eventually gets unlocked for you and you only get to choose what 4 skills to use and which runes to combine with each one. Your strength, dexterity, intelligence and vitality get automatically increased, depending on your class. No more making a tank out of a ranger I am afraid. And this is where the game looses its first star.The fact that you get to have a sidekick that does practically little more than keep the mobs occupied until you dispense of them, does not help either.CULTURAL PHOBIAS DO NOT A GOOD STORY MAKEYes, the story plot is infantile, disrespectful to the original games (I will refrain from spoiling it) and it offers very little help in immersing into the game world. It is unfortunate because, BLIZZARD has proved in the past that they can produce games with a very good back-story, such asStarcraft II.However, this a game franchise that is heavily invested on the Judeo-Christian culture of the Devil. Just read the name on the box! So, taking away demonic pentagrams and most religious symbols (some crosses can still be found) fools no one. Because once you go down that road and then decide to backup, you should make sure not to step on yourself and trip. As in: if a golden-eyed Fallen Angel (Hello!) is helping you fight Diablo, are you sure who is the Devil and who is not?LOOT. LOOT NEVER CHANGES.Well designed and clearly labeled items make all the difference in the world. I would love for Borderlands 2 items to have such a clear Damager-Per-Second (DPS) number to make comparisons easier. Pair this with an inventory that is big enough and free of the need to play item-Tetris in (all items take up either one or two vertical squares) and you have yourself almost loot haven. Almost because you still get too many unusable items, mostly because of class restrictions.You can stash such items in your common stash to share with your other heroes (on the same BattleNet account) but make sure to find the necessary...700,000 gold to pay for all the extra stash space. Hint: use the Auction House while you still can.The only thing I found missing is the ability to add sockets to magical items and enchant regular ones.THE AUCTION HOUSE: BRILLIANT! (WHEN IT WORKS)I am going to go against the current here but here it is: I found the Auction House a brilliant idea. Well designed and decently executed. I am going to be sad to see it go on March, as announced. I can only hope they change their mind before then.In all honesty, I am currently a Demon Hunter at Nightmare difficulty. And I have heard the complaints that it is impossible to finish Inferno without Real-Money Auction House (which is clearly not how it is supposed to work) but up to Nightmare, using the Auction House is the only way to get enough money to be able to do the enhancements you want, craft or buy the items you covet and unlock the precious extra stash space you need.CHAINS IN NEED OF BREAKINGI withheld the second star because of the always-online requirement. Because it is indeed a hassle and a hindrance (just try pausing in town for longer than half and hour and see what happens). Yes, the game does offer some gameplay features (namely, the Auction-House) to compensate for the inconvenience but they all give way to anger and frustration whenever BlLIZZARD's servers go down  and you are unable to play a Single-player game for days at a time(!). Take away the Auction-House, however, and the always-online requirement becomes a severe and now unjustified hindrance!THE ORIGINAL SINNo, D3 looses its third and final star for being both short and boring at times. There, I said it. Yes, it is a well balanced eye-candie, with tons of loot, problematic character development yet the gameplay feels like at chore at times and it is over before you know it. I even found Act I (the one offered for free as a demo) to be better designed and longer than the rest.It is like that old Woody Allen joke: two old ladies are complaining about their retirement home catering. &#34;The food was awful, barely edible&#34;, &#34;I know&#34;, her friend replied, &#34;and such small portions!&#34;.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}

The environment is sharp and realistic, textures are detailed, and there are little extras here that simply weren't available in Call of Duty 2:  things like destructible environments, physics effects, and a focal blur that can sharpen your center of vision when you aim down the sights of your weapon or create disorienting sensations when you're taking damage.  Rain, water effects, and fire all look quite nice too.There are some fun parts here that are specific to the PS3's sixaxis controller, and then some not-so-fun ones.  Sneaking up behind an enemy soldier and shoving the controller at an angle will nicely rifle-butt them and knock them out.  Twisting the controller in the air (like winding a watch) to set the fuse on explosives is a nice touch.  Asking me to hold the controller sideways and move it up and down in a semicircle to simulate paddling a boat is a bit ridiculous and I never seemed to find the right movements.  I was also given the option of using the sixaxis like a steering wheel when driving, but I found it to be too unpredictable: sluggish to start, then overcompensating once the controller reached a certain angle. Thankfully this feature let me use the left stick as an alternative.Unfortunately, the gameplay is dreadful.  It's one thing to have odd button mappings (R1 to accelerate, but Circle to brake; have to pick up a hot grenade with Square, but can't throw it back until you tap R2), but it's quite another to be able to see parts of the game where corners were cut in order to make the thing work.  For example, there's a driving sequence where you have to keep an eye on your compass and hit one marker after another.  During this, you will drive through fences and gates, smashing them with the nose of your Jeep.  Explosions go off when they're scripted to, and trees fall across the road, increasing the suspense.  Except...if the tree hits the road before you pass it, you'd be stuck--so you're allowed to drive right through the tree.  If an explosion goes off and you're way too close to it--you'll survive.  And it's almost funny to see the Germans hole themselves up in buildings full of barrels of gasoline, with more stacked around the outside walls or stacked up right next to machine-gun nests.The biggest problem with Call of Duty 3 though is the AI.  In other titles in the CoD series, I've seen issues like teammates walking in front of your line of fire while you're shooting, or nudging you out from cover to take your spot.  Nothing's perfect and I'm used to this sort of thing.  However, the behaviors in Call of Duty 3 can get downright bizarre.  Enemy soldiers sneaking up on you might continue to tiptoe without firing even when they're only 10 feet away and you're shooting at them.  Your allies occasionally turn around and stare at the ceiling or the sky.  Are they covering your back?  Nope; they just appear to be confused.  The best example of this was in a sequence where we all started moving down a trench.  Everyone is crouched, and German soldiers pop out in front of us and start shouting and raining down heavy fire.  My allies suddenly whirl around and start firing behind them.  Have we been flanked from behind?  I spin around and...the only person behind us is one of our buddies.  Who is standing up.  And my allies shoot him dead before turning around to face the Germans.  We're supposed to set explosives on anti-aircraft installments and then get out of the way.  When I run to cover, I often notice them running towards the explosives, taking cover as close to them as they can (sometimes behind those gasoline barrels).The first-time entry of a series onto new hardware can be daunting.  The programmers at Treyarch deserve a lot of credit for their hard work at the artistry of Call of Duty 3.  While no game is perfect, it is a shame that some of this game went unpolished, even after having this much time to patch things up.  If you want to follow the entire Call of Duty series, then there's something to enjoy for you here; however, you should consider this one of the weakest entries in an otherwise stellar series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2010"}

Okay, THPS4 (which I also own) is very good too, and has touched up on some things, but for some reason, Tony Hawk 3 will always be my favorite. (Maybe just for the Los Angeles level...)Everyone has at least heard of this series. And most people own it. The main purpose of the game is to start off small (whether you use one of the 14 pros available, or if you're like me and you have to create your very own skater), and to complete several objectives and open up different levels in order to become a full-fledged pro. You also have to hunt down stat points and extra boards. (Well, you don't HAVE to, but it's recommended.) You can do just about every trick imaginable: spins, reverts, manuals, grinds, etc. If you're using a created skater, than by the end of the game, you can add 10 different special tricks (out of a very large selection). I have spent many an hour playing this game over the past year, and I never get sick of it.The most fun thing I can think of for this game is creating your very own skater. Creating yourself, your neighbor, friend, co-worker, even your enemy (so you can beat up on them in 2-Player)... it never gets tiresome. With many logos for T-Shirts and many boards (all of which are real brands!), making your own shirt is lots of fun. Blue Zero shirt? Go right ahead. Black Neversoft? Yup. Maroon Nokia?

I thought the Metroid series was dead, especially after Metroid:Fusion, a game that goes against everything that is Metroid.Boy was I wrong.....Metroid Prime is one of the greatest games I have ever had the fortune of playing. Even though the graphics are 3-D, and beautiful, it still retains everything that made Metroid and Super Metroid masterpieces, it still has the feeling of being on a desolate, isolated planet, waging an epic war against the space pirates with a one-manned army that is Samus. Before Metal Gear, and as far as my research goes, even before the first Zelda game, there was Samus. It is hard to believe that with the high standards of Metroid fans, Metroid Prime was still as much a success as it was, and is. I can't really comment on whether this game is as good as Metroid or Super Metroid, because those games were 2-d, and this is 3-d, thus it would be unfair. However, this is one of the greatest games of all time, and here is why...Graphics-99/100 Wow, Retro Studios really outdid themselves. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, better than anything I have seen to date. As much as I hate to admit it, graphics have always played a major role in Metroid games. The first Metroid for NES had amazing , groundbreaking graphics, with excrutiating details in the backrounds. Remember the purple, orb like things in Norfair in the original Metroid? That is what I am talking about. The only problem I have with Metroid Prime, if I had to think of one, would be that the surroundings aren't as creepy as the other games in the series.  Tallen Overworld is reminiscent of the first Turok game for N64, just with Metroid flavor. The Phazon Mines and Magmoor Caverns bring in a pretty good atmosphere, but I wasn't a huge fan of the Phendrana Drifts environments, I think they were a little too typical for a Metroid game. Even so, even the Phendrana Drifts environments look beautiful, if not 100 % Metroid. But the thing abaout the Metroid series I guess, is that they always do groundbraking things. Super Metroid took the original and blew it out of the water, and Metroid Prime doesn't disappoint at all. I think the graphics in this game are about as good as they could possibly ever have been, and I couldn't as for better. The beams also look pretty awesome, and still stand by the classic Metroid beams.Music/sound- 95/100 Definitely wonderful in this aspect as well. The music is very atmospheric and sets the tone almost all of the game. The music, in my opinion, isn't quite the dark, atmospherically beautiful masterpiece that was Super Metroid, but it definitely sets the tone and gets it done when it has to. I particularly like the Tallen Overworld , Phendrana Drifts , and Chozo Ruins themes. The music is much more electro sounding than other Metroid games, but still is quite an aural pleasure. Oh yeah, the Meta Ripley theme is pretty awesome as well (basically a remake of the original Ridley theme from Super Metroid, one of my all time favorite Metroid themes.Controls- 100/100 Brilliant, the c- pad works great as a beam switcher, and the control pad switches the visors. Every single controller set- up is flawless, and Samus controlls as good as ever, now able to lock on and even do side dashes.Overall- 98/100 This game is as close to perfection as it gets these days, and is worth it for everyone to buy, especially since it is only about 15-20 bucks. Buy it, you won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2005"}

The last rodeo for the creators of the most influential and successful video game franchise of the last decade.  And there's only one question on everybody's mind: does Bungie's final Halo game live up to the hype?  Depends.  If you're looking for something to reinvent the wheel and wow you like the first one did, look elsewhere.  But if you want Halo+, here it is. I've rocked every single Halo game through multiple campaigns on various difficulty levels and logged in countless hours and sleepless nights slaughtering my fellow gamers by the thousands, and I have to say this will do nicely.  In this review I'm going to focus on what differentiates Reach from previous iterations of the franchise.While the campaign of Halo: Reach lacks the \"OMG\" factor of the original, the extremely sophisticated split narrative of the first sequel, the bombast of the trilogy closer, and even the brilliant moodiness of ODST, this prequel is still a solid story filled with all the run-and-gun action and overwhelming odds that have made Halo the signature franchise of this gaming generation. The story of 6 Spartans (Noble Team) encountering the alien Covenant prior to a full-scale invasion of the planet Reach, hopelessly defending the world they call home, discovering mankind's salvation, and their eventual sacrifice make for a fantastic narrative with tons of excuses for action.  I very much miss the massive three-way battles and dynamic set-pieces that made the first two games so memorable and the score seems much more understated and less epic than what I'm used to, but nonetheless no argument could be made that the singleplayer is junk.  Besides, it's just the appetizer.So the campaign seems to be missing that special something to distinguish itself from it's predecessors, everybody knows the multiplayer is what keeps Halo in your console for years on end.  And the legendary ultra-competitive online combat the franchise is known for has never been better.  Never.  Not even close.  So yeah, guys.  If there is one must-own game in the series, this is it. First off, the matchmaking is fast as lightning. This means less time listening to 12 year-olds shout obscenities and sing awful songs in the pre-game lobby and more time killing and mocking them as you squat on their corpse. Adding a credit-based system that rewards individual achievement on the battlefield rather than ranking you based entirely on whether your team won or lost was a great move.  After all, why should you suffer just because you get stuck with quitters and noobs while you yourself are dropping fools left and right?  The earned credits act both as experience points to advance your rank and can be spent buying stuff and customizing your Spartan.  This rules.  What they are asking for some of the niftier effects is rather outrageous if not insane, but Bungie knows how to light a fire under your rear end when it comes to keeping gamers coming back for more.  And they send out a bevy of challenges on a daily and weekly basis to give players the opportunity to gather some extra scratch from the various game modes.  Thanks, guys.  But still, the prices hurt.  Do I really want to spend ALL my hard-earned credits getting Cortana's voice in Firefight mode when I'm still eyeing that sweet black visor that'd make me look like the biggest bad@z$ in the galaxy?  Can't have it all, I suppose.  Speaking of Firefight, the perpetual deathfest mode that debuted in ODST has been revamped with a time limit, matchmaking (thank GOD), and extreme customization options.  In a word: perfect.So now we have more customization than ever and a more skill-based rating system.  But what's different about the GAME, man?!  Two words: armor abilities.  No more picking up power-ups like Super Mario Brothers.  Various game modes give you loadout options with various combinations of weapons as well as a rechargeable superpower.  First off is the long-overdue jetpack, which speaks for itself.  Then there is the hologram, which allows you to send a false double of yourself running to a point of your choosing.  This is perfect for distracting noobs and dealing with snipers.  Active camouflage renders you mostly invisible and scrambles enemy radar (as well as your own) for stealth maniacs.  Armor lock allows you to become temporarily invulnerable at the cost of being unable to move or act.  Great for defensive-minded players who don't mind acting as bait for their flanking teammates. Also good for D is the drop-shield, which is modified from Halo 3.  There are also dashing and rolling abilities that allow you to juke and sprint to cover (or the best weapons) that are helpful to more traditional players not interested in fancy gimmicks.  Something for everyone.  These abilities add an extra layer of strategy and challenge to a game that was never hurting for either and I can't applaud their addition enough.  To all opposed......well, the new Call of Duty is right around the corner.  One of the coolest (albeit smaller) additions to gameplay is the option to assassinate your enemy when you approach him from behind.  These animations are varied and cool as hell.  Sure, you could just hit them with the butt of your rifle and move on, but nothing beats getting your hands bloody and stabbing a jerk in the head with your survival knife.The weapons have been rebalanced and some replaced for what is clearly the best Halo arsenal yet.  Dual-wielding has been removed, and I find I don't much miss it.  Each weapon is deadly in it's own way and being able to choose loadouts means that you don't always have to hunt for your favorite depending on what mode you play.  The most controversial point was the replacing of the fan favorite headshot machine known as the Battle Rifle (BR) in favor of the semi-automatic Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR).  While many Halo fans sobbed long and hard over this, I always found the BR to be a dull, robotic weapon that was spammed TO DEATH. The DMR is dynamic, powerful, and rewards patience.  While you can shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger, the reticule bloom simulates recoil and requires you to pace your shots to retain maximum accuracy whereas the BR always paced the shots for you like your mommy holding your hand when you cross the street. If you are one of those who complains that the DMR makes the game less skillful, you are probably not as good as you thought you were.  Adaptation is a skill as well.  Learn it.  And Reach is a game that rewards adaptability very much.  With so many ways for your opponent to get the better of you, this is no longer the game you could play in your sleep.  Deal.My only complaint with Halo: Reach (aside from the embarrassing immaturity of the online community) is that the big maps are poorly designed.  They even ruined my all-time favorite (Blood Gulch/Coagulation/Valhalla, now known as Hemorrhage). This makes Invasion mode -which pits a team of 6 Spartans against 6 Covenant Elites in a progressive objective-based battle- much less fun than it should be.  Allowing players to vote on game modes was great, but Halo is overdue for the ability to search for games based on type.  There are too many players who vote in packs for SWAT (or as I call it, Call of Duty) or sniper matches (Ghost Recon) over traditional Halo games, which are what I buy the game to play.  Why play Halo at all when you clearly want to be playing another shooter entirely?  One of the mysteries of the gaming universe, I guess.  Maybe Call of Duty: Black Ops will have a sci-fi mode with energy shields, motion detectors, sticky grenades, and the like and those same players will always vote to play those modes in that game.  Hey, it could happen.In conclusion, fanboys will gush, malcontents will insist Halo 3 was better even though they still choose to play this one for 10 hours a day instead, and Reach will see a very long shelf life.  Meanwhile, millions of virtual avatars will lose their lives, friendships and rivalries will be forged in the heat of online combat, buddies will join forces to take on the Covenant again and again, and the Halo juggernaut will march on and on.  So shall it ever be, even with the original developers gone from the franchise that they made into a billion dollar industry unto itself.  Thanks for all the good times, Bungie.  May your noobs be forever pwned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2010"}

Then there is no way to grind and get your characters stronger before you face these incredible difficult fights with no reward behind them.  Why would you do this to the final fantasy series. I waited so long for this game and what I got was crap. The Story never really pulls you in and makes you want to find out what happens. Your more like, WHAT IS GOING ON? With a bunch of characters you never feel connected to. I think RPGs are on a down hill slope. Unless Bioware has a hand in it.Square Enix just puts out crap now. One right after another.

I'm a huge Uncharted fan and getting any and everything Uncharted I can get my hands on. This device, for me, is strictly a gaming device. My girlfriend likes to study in quiet or watch stuff on TV I don't want to watch (like anything on the E channel, except for The Soup) so I needed something to keep me busy when I'm too tired to read comics or draw. I have the newest Droid by Motorola, so I didn't get a Vita to take pictures. The camera isn't anything special on the Vita. Internet usage is about the same as doing it on my PS3, so I don't do It on the Vita, that's why I have a phone. I don't play games on my phone, THAT is why I got a vita. That is why the Vita is so awesome. It's OLED screen is immaculate, Rayman Origins (amazing game, a must own) and Uncharted: Golden Abyss look really great on here.*Dual joysticks are great and make it easy to play games that could easily be home console games.*Little slots for the game cards and data cards are small but easy enough to remove.*Button scheme is identical to PSONE, PS2 and PS3 so it's familiar.*It's fast, downloading movies and games from the PSN is quick, even with my slow internet connection.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"A novel a day\"","summary":"Very mediocre","reviewText":"So, a lot of (valid) complaints about the latest iteration from Sony is the lack of games.  Well, those are incredibly annoying, but you would be justified in thinking that these complaints are not reflective of the system itself.  That being said, you may logically conclude that if the system itself is not unworthy of praise, that you may find things to use the system for until that point where some decent games are released.  And, in my humble opinion, therein lies the problem.Let's take today for example.  It is 4/21/14, and the PS4 has been released for 6+ months.  Today, however, the PSN is undergoing maintenance for six hours until ~6 p.m. EST.  If this were my PS3 I could load up some movies via my itunes account onto a thumb drive and plug them in and watch them.  Alas, you cannot do this on the PS4.  Perhaps you could listen to some of the thousands of songs you have dl'ed and collected throughout the years?  Not happening.  Well, wait, if you look at the Sony announcement for the scheduled maintenance, it states that you can still play MP on games, just not access the store, etc.  However, you (or, I, rather), cannot load BF4 if I'm not connected to the internet.  It gets stuck at the main menu &#34;rain screen&#34;.  Do a search for it, if you do not believe me.  So, basically, today, my PS4 is a blu-ray player only.  But, you need the blu-ray disc, no transferring of files via external HD or anything like that.And this is just one example.  I feel that a lot of people are defending the system because they think that, over time, games will be released that will justify its existence.  I do not agree with this though process.  It is odd, to me, to defend something for what it MIGHT BE/BECOME.  As it stands right now, I've talked 2 of my siblings out of getting a PS4 b/c of the reasons above, and others (install time 30+ hours for some games!?)All in all, a huge disappointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2014"}

I have owned all of Sony's consoles and I have been extremely happy with them with no issues at all.....with the PS4 that has changed.. I was one of the early adopters (have been with all my consoles) and was able to play the PS4 for at least a few days, until a weird sound was coming out of my disc drive. I did some troubleshooting and it worked for a few hours, but then the disc did not want to eject and I would get an error message stating that there was no disc inserted in the drive. After half hour troubleshooting, the disc ejected, but the drive started making loud weird noises, so I exchanged the system.Replacement PS4 - So I was able to hook the replacement, played it for a few days and thought I was good, until my screen went black for a few seconds during gameplay. I thought it was just the game, but a few minutes later, the same 2 to 3 second black screen returned.... I called Sony and they tried to troubleshoot the hdmi, told me to try a different one, or different tv. After time wasted, I decided to return this replacement as well and try getting another one somewhere else.Lets start fresh with my 3rd PS4 - So I get another PS4 and unfortunately for me, this one has flickering issues with games........ I have noticed some weird strobe light like graphic flickers which is not game specific. I've seen this flickering with BF4, Killzone and Call of Duty.....

Posey","summary":"The PS4 welcomes you to next gen gaming","reviewText":"Decided during E3 that I was going to go with the PS4 due to price and Sony's attention to the gamer vs. publishers with the then controversial Xbox One decision to halt used game sales.  Microsoft went back on that but the good will that Sony earned, plus the $100 price difference really drew me in.I got my console on release day and after a few hiccups with setting up the internet (which could have been user error) I was ready to roll.  The UI is basic, but that's not a negative.  Everything you need is on one bar that scrolls horizontally.  Your most recent games played come first and the game in the console itself is the first in line.  Your video services are grouped in a video folder of sorts to avoid clutter and the overall experience of finding a game and playing it is seamless.  I can see this possibly being an issue later in the console's life when there are a lot of games to sort through but I doubt this will be the design choice the PS4 has in 5 years.  Software updates come and go and I'm sure it'll change.The real draw of any new console though is what it can do.  This particular device plays PS4 games and those games look amazing.  There aren't a lot of games out right now to actually play but the ones out of note include Killzone Shadow Fall, Assassin's Creed 4, Need for Speed Rivals, and Resogun.  If you picked up only those games you'd be set for a true next gen experience with amazing visuals and all around great games.The PS4 is a great investment if you're looking to get into next gen gaming on the console.  The Xbox One is an alternative choice for people who want a more media focuses experience, but for those of us who want to spend less for just an all around great gaming console, you can't go wrong with the PS4!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}

Next thing you know, I get hooked.  This is similar to Super Mario Brothers that I played on the Super Nintendo as a teenager.  There are some interesting twists like the ability to shoot your opponents and a super mushroom that allows you to just destroy everything in your path.  It does a great job incorporating the touch screen.What I also found entertaining were the mini games, when you want to take a break from the frustration of the main game.  I admit, some levels are easy, but there are some levels that are a bit challenging.  There is a good entertainment factor but certain sections have a high level of difficulty that needs to be planned out.Overall, for a 'retro-type' game, it is well done and will entertain all ages.I highly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2009"}

Earning money to buy things is incredibly difficult. Unlike previous games in the series, enemies do not drop gil. Instead, they will sometimes drop loot which you can then sell. Here's the caviat, enemies don't always drop loot. Stealing anyone? I find more time stealing items than I think is necessary for the gameplay. Also, there is the fact that you have to buy literally everything in the game. Weapons, armor, and accessories I think are reasonable to purchase. But you also have to buy your spells and abilities! This makes stealing and looting essential. You can also poach enemies for additional loot (this, however, will prevent your characters from earning the experience and license points you could obtain by defeating the enemy).I also have gripes about the ability system. Every ability requires spending License Points which you obtain by defeating enemies. However, in order to equip better armor, weapons, etc. you have purchase the necessary license. This becomes incredibly frustrating since you need to purchase equipment licenses and then need to purchase spell and stat licenses as well. This game has forced me to grind so much that it's ridiculous. I'm at about 56 hours of gameplay and from what I've seen I'm a little over halfway through the game. This is insane. I prefer my rpgs to be able to play through in about 40 hours total (I like to get back to my normal life at sometime). Occasionally I will come across a lengthy rpg I can digest for long periods of time or repeated plays (a la Mass Effect).As far as the story goes, it's ok. A lot of the story elements in this game remind me very much of FF VI. There is not a lot of new ground here but I'm usually ok with that if there is a good flow to the game. Since I have to grind so much when I do play the story elements I've forgotten things that have happened up this point. Also, the characters are not very detailed or developed very well. The main character (Vaan) seems to be lost in the mix of the main plotline and is actually one of the weaker characters of the game (although most of the characters are fairly weakly developed, Baltheir is the only worth a damn).Sidequests are almost a must. These occur in the form of hunts which will grant experience and loot. In most rpgs I'm not a sidequest player. I usually stick to the main story elements but sometimes when there is a world I find to be incredibly fun or gorgeous I will so sidequests (I will also do them if I've already played through the game once without them to vary the playing experience). This game almost makes sidequests a must which just about makes the story drag and pause for unacceptable amounts of time.This is a game that I think looked good and had great sound, a good concept, but very poor execution. Some of the game mechanics are annoying and irritating. I wouldn't buy this game unless you can get it for less than $10 and have the patience to play a ridiculous amount of hours. I've never given up on an FF game before but this is the first. I've completely lost interest at this point and am hoping that FF13 will be redeeming.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2012"}

As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Mike G \"Mike G\"","summary":"Who doesn't love killing Zombies?","reviewText":"I enjoyed the first Dead Rising, so picking up this was a no-brainer. Although it seems that they have continued on with the same theme of taking place in a shopping mall, they have added a ton of new weapons and weapon combos for endless hours of Zombie killing.The bosses are a bit overpowered and difficult to beat, but the normal zombies are a piece of cake. So when going against those bosses, remember to stock up on weapons and food to overcome them. Most of the boss have a secret way of killing them, so if you find yourself stuck, just google the solution.As for the game itself, you are timed again and need to keep finding Zombrex to keep your daughter alive in the game. Although not difficult to do, I really hate timed games. Especially ones that you can just get caught up killing zombies for a while and not relies that time is ticking by.Try saving as many survivors as possible! They are key to leveling up faster.Also, Capcom has added an additional little bonus of multiplayer play! Now you can compete in a gladiator style match against players online. It's pretty fun, and any of the winning money that you obtain will be directly deposited into your campaign.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Best Halo game to date","reviewText":"I've played all the Halo games including Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo Reach, Halo ODST, and Halo Wars.In my opinion, I would rank the games from best to worst as Halo, Halo Reach, Halo 3, Halo 2, Halo ODST, then Halo Wars.I've played through the game at least a dozen times over the years. While it doesn't have some of the perks of the older games such as dual-wielding weapons, it still holds its value. A lot more people are going to realize just how good this game is when they get the 10 year anniversary remake on the 360 coming in November 2011.The battles between aliens and humans has long been done before, but never to this bliss. The story is believable, the characters seem real, and it all comes together nicely.Gameplay: this is my favorite part of the game. Though the story is a close 2nd. You basically jump right into combat after a few warm-up lessons. You shoot your way through your ship and try and make it to the escape pods in the first level. You face the covenant forces that include grunts, elites, jackals, and hunters. You can carry two weapons and up to 8 grenades. This is a first person shooter while in combat mode. You can shoot your weapon and throw a grenade at the same time. Your weapons include pistols, rapid fires, shotguns, snipers, grenade and rocket launchers, and you can also pick up the covenant's weapons including the plasma rifle, needler, sniper, etc. Every weapon can be used as a blunt instrument. The marine grenades are traditional bounce and explode while the covenant grenades you pick up are plasma and stick to the target. You get lots of vehicles to use in the game including a jeep, tank, enemies hover craft and ship. You eventually have to fight a new alien race called the flood. There are many levels that take place on your ship, the ring world (Halo), and the enemies ship. The gameplay is long but you never get the repetitive feeling.Story: You are space marines from earth and are fighting a war against the covenant who seek to use what they think is a powerful weapon that can win them the war. They have chased you through the galaxy and you end up on a strange ring world called Halo. The covenant seeks to unlock the power of Halo and you pursue and try to stop them. You have an AI hottie with you called Cortana (voiced by the talented Jen Taylor) that helps you throughout the game, along with other marines that survived the assault on your ship.Multiplayer: The game allows you to play through the campaign with 2 players. With the game's difficulty setting, it is a blast to have 2 players and go through the hardest difficulty. You can have one of you hold back while the other one goes in guns blazing until he dies and responds back to you. Then switch off. While there is no online multiplayer maps, you can system link 4 consoles and play up to a 16 player battle. I did get to try this with a group of friends and it was a fun experience. There are multiple modes for battles and while it is fun to battle it out with friends, I still prefer the campaign mode.This game definitely made me a fan of the Xbox.

While it keeps the game challenging, part of the joy of levelling is becoming more powerful.  With enemies that level with your character, you never really become \"God-like\" as the enemies become more powerful as you do.Really, there isn't a lot not to like.  the game is at least 200 hours long, with all of the side quests and such outside the main story line.

I thought, well, it's not 60 bucks anymore; why not give it a try.I am VERY glad that I did. This game has a HUGE map (biggest I have seen; as big as Oblivion GTA San Andreas, GTAIV, etc are, this is bigger than probably all those games and more COMBINED, I mean, seriously), there are TONS of things to do, all sorts of vehicles, main story missions, faction missions, probably thousand of locations (cities, towns, villages, settlements) to explore for \"weapon parts\" \"auto parts\" \"armor parts\" and so on (these are the games version of \"Hidden Packages), and you can do whatever you want, and kill whomever you want--in fact that is the POINT OF THE GAME, to cause as much mayhem and destruction (\"CHAOS\" as the game calls it), that you can! Causing \"CHAOS\" actually advances your character--as you perpetrate the mayhem, this unlocks future missions, sort of like \"respect\" does in the Saints Row games. You are especially rewarded for destroying structures, vehicles, antennas, sat dishes, etc, marked as government property. Who wouldn't find THAT fun, lol. Kill a few civilians in a town of any size? The military responds and tries to take you out. I especially like finding a gas station, making the pumps blow up, and then fighting the government goons that show up.There IS a story line, that sort of continues the one from the last game, but the story really, here, is secondary. Your object, again, is to cause mayhem and destruction to unlock more missions. When you are on a main or \"Agency\" mission, this advances the story. Other missions are for the factions, you help various gangs take over sectors of the island (I guess so that they can eventually control enough to over throw the dictator, but I haven't got that far yet), when you aren't on any kind of mission, it's basically free roam--you knock someone off their motorcycle, grab their car or whatnot, and wander around randomly causing as much death  and destruction as you can, and exploring every where for those \"packages.\" I found one thing called an \"air challenge\" where you jump into a single engine tail dragger plane, and try to fly through a course of markers in the air. I missed the third one, said the heck with it, and flew around for awhile looking at the area. By the way, there are numerous airports! I found one, landed there, (It turned out to be Panua international). It gave me credit for finding the location. But now, I was like where the hell am I? lolOne thing though, this map is HUGE. I know I keep saying that, but until you see it you won't believe it. It can take a LONG time to go from one end to the other. Even with a car, (or better a copter or plane), it will take a LONG TIME. By the way the zip line and parachute are still in the game. See a low flying helicopter? Zip line it, and jack it! If it's a military one, attack things with it!Now, I have to mention the ONLY thing I DON'T like about this game. The ONLY thing. THE SAVE SYSTEM. The way it works is, when you are on a mission, there is auto save, that makes \"checkpoints\" for you (SIGH. DAMN IT). So, if you die, and you will, (this game is fun, but it is NOT necessarily easy---you are usually outnumbered with not that much ammo, relatively), the game takes you back to your previous check point. The problem with \"check points\" is they don't save every thing you have done, found, etc between them. So back to the last check point, start all over from you were. GOD that is ANNOYING. Once you do get to the NEXT one, then whatever you accomplished is saved, but not until then. There are \"save slots\" but this is NOT  a quick save. If you are on a mission, and try to load your manual save, you will start the the last checkpoint, with nothing new saved. If you are NOT on a mission, the manual save will usually save any progress in the statistics that it follows, but you will NOT spawn were you left off, you will appear back at the nearest \"safe location\" to wherever you were. If you DIE outside a mission, the game will auto save any new things you found, changes to your stats, etc. But again, you will spawn at the closest \"base.\" Quite frankly, if it were not for this, the game would have got 5 stars from me, not 4.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best games to hit the Wii yet","reviewText":"The Metroid Prime series took Nintendo's much loved series to a new level with the first two installments of the series on the Gamecube.  Now, finally, the Prime trilogy is completed with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, which is undoubtedly the best FPS on the Wii, and one of the best overall game to hit the system yet.  Once again playing as intergalactic space heroine Samus Aran, you should feel right at home here the minute you fire up the game.  Even with a new control scheme that takes advantage of the Wii-mote and nunchuk controls, veterans of the series will have little to no trouble getting into the swing of things.  As you can expect, there are a fair share of inventive puzzles and great levels to explore, and the boss battles are nothing short of spectacularly memorable as well.  If there are any downsides to Metroid Prime 3, it's that the game can be too easy for some, and that as a whole, doesn't really do a whole lot more differently than the previous Metroid Prime games have done.  That aside though, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a more than worthy conclusion to the Prime trilogy and has been more than worth the wait as well.  It also goes without saying that this is the best FPS on the system yet, and one of the best games available for the Wii at this time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}

Just so it's clear, the gameplay is substandard, but it's just the vehicle for the amazing story. The main gameplay gimmick is that you have to shine your flashlight on your enemies before you can shoot and kill them. This is performed with an auto-aim that is pretty generous, you basically just have to point your flashlight near the enemies and click the right trigger. This gameplay is done well, but it can get a little boring after doing it over and over. Your weapons are relatively limited with your armament consisting of a revolver, a shotgun/hunting rifle, a flare gun (which always has very limited ammo), flares, and flash bangs. I would have liked to see more creative weapons, or weapon upgrades, but that's just something to look forward to in the game's sequel. The weakest part of the game is definitely the small sections of platforming. The movement is just much too floaty, making it very easy to over/under-jump and fall to your death (insta-deaths are always something I've hated in video games). Thankfully the checkpoint system is usually pretty efficient, though at times the developers chose points further away from the difficult areas than would be appreciated. The only other slightly annoying aspect of the game is the driving camera angles. Instead of having the common gaming ability to look around and help direct the car with the right stick. Instead this game has every small movement of the stick shoot the viewing angle around to the extremes, making it much harder than it needs to be to look at the environment while driving. Other than that, Alan Wake has very few flaws. It is an interesting and relatively original horror story that I would loving watching in the theater. I won't risk any spoilers, but except for the end (which is deliberately annoying and nebulous to set up Alan Wake 2) the story keeps you on your toes with very interesting, scary, and sometimes funny characters, twists, and dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.My Rating: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2011"}

There was no game out there that really brought me in and made me want to play it for longer than 1 hour at a a time. My boyfriend has an XBox 360 and tried to get me interested into a variety of different games, but none of them held my interest. We came to the conclusion that I was simply not into gaming.However, one game finally did grab my attention. That was this game, \"Assassin's Creed 2.\" At first I simply watched, but later I found myself asking \"Hey, can I take the controller for a bit?\"The story is downright amazing. You play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an assassin who witnessed the hanging of his father and brothers. He then seeks vengeance against the Templar Order, and their Grand Master, Rodrigo Borgia, who had ordered the execution. Ezio is a highly likable, strong character. When you see his family being executed, you feel anger rise within you. You are rooting for him to take revenge. You want him to succeed and you can't wait for him to complete his quest! If a video game can make you feel the same emotions as your character, then it's definitely a great story. The characters are so deep. It really brings you in. You feel like you are Ezio.Throughout the game you are given various missions to complete. My favorite mission types involved the ones where you had to quietly follow a particular individual and attempt to kill them. It's one of those missions where you have to be careful and know where your boundaries are if you wish to be successful. There are a lot of missions throughout this game, most of which involve killing, but you are an assassin after all so this makes sense. The killings can be interesting. As the game goes on you will learn how to kill two opponents at one time, how to disarm an opponent, how to kill with a single stab, etc.As for the controls, they take getting used to in the beginning, but you will quickly learn how everything works. Pretty soon you will find yourself climbing buildings, jumping, and leaping from great heights into a haystack without a problem (aka leap of faith).Overall, this game is the reason I purchased an XBox 360 for myself. I went from someone who plays practically no video games to someone who plays 5-6 hours per day. I'm not sure if I should be proud of that, but at least we know this is a fun game! If you are a fan of adventure games, then purchase this one! You will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8JS","reviewerName":"TheRumblePack.com","summary":"Baby-boomer Beatles devotees and hardcore plastic rockers should both be thrilled","reviewText":"Music games have come so far since the original Guitar Hero hit the PS2. Four years ago, we tolerated questionable covers of some of our favorite songs, and even as more music labels started lending their talent to the plastic instrument titans, a handful of classic bands remained unattainable. We had the Stones and Dylan, but there was no way we'd ever see Zeppelin, Pink Floyd or the Beatles, right? Well, still no luck on those first two, but after some cajoling and (likely) a proverbial dump truck full of money, Harmonix somehow booked the Fab Four for their first video game tour in The Beatles Rock Band.Of course, The Beatles Rock Band is not the first band-centric music game in recent years. Metallica, Aerosmith and Van Halen have all received star treatment from competitor Guitar Hero, while Harmonix did release a pricy AC/DC disc last year as a Wal-Mart exclusive. But for The Beatles --arguably the most popular band in modern history - the developer suggested that a major overhaul was in order. And while the results may no necessarily live up to that initial announcement, baby-boomer Beatles devotees and hardcore plastic rockers should both be thrilled with the game.If you've seen screenshots or that surreal Abbey Road commercial, you know by now that the core game doesn't deviate much from the scrolling tracks layout established previously in the genre. And though The Beatles Rock Band does encourage the (much ballyhooed) harmonies, my family, friends and I were often too tone-deaf to really put this feature to use. But while the controls remain tried-and-true, it's the presentation that truly makes this collaboration a success.While the first two Rock Band games were always stylistically more dynamic than Guitar Hero thanks to numerous visual filters, this Beatles edition's attention to detail and psychedelic backgrounds raise the bar even higher. Shea Stadium and the Ed Sullivan set have been recreated beautifully, while the Abbey Road sojourns offer trippy music videos for the studio songs never performed live. Many of the latter transport the band outside of the studio completely. (You'll ride aboard the titular vehicle for \"Yellow Submarine,\" for instance.)This visual fidelity means that the customization options had to be sacrificed. This is a worthy tradeoff, as it allows Harmonix to show how the band's costumes and style evolved along with their music. Seeing them get from their early 60s mop-top/suit getup to the bearded rooftop veterans just prior to their split is truly remarkable. And assuming that you're playing the 45 songs in the order recommended for the story mode, you'll see plenty of supplementary photos and archival video snippets to back up the artistic direction.As for the actual track list, many reviewers have already expressed frustration at the small song list. I, too, wish that \"Strawberry Fields,\" \"Norwegian Wood\" and several others hadn't been omitted, but at least 44 of the songs are truly wonderful, with the early cover of \"Boys\" as the only oddity. Tracks like \"Within You Without You\" and the downloadable \"All You Need is Love\" show that sitars and string orchestras can be adapted to the plastic instruments as well, so songs like \"Eleanor Rigby\" are possible in the future.For many of you, the opposite may be true - you're so sick of band games that even The Beatles aren't enough to lure you back. If you fall into this camp, I'd urge you to still give this Rock Band a shot. The music is so joyous, the presentation so impeccable, that you may find yourself hooked all over again.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

Williams \"zerokoolkw\"","summary":"They've done it again!!","reviewText":"When I first heard of Smackdown 2006 I was skeptical. How many improvements could be made to a game in a year that is usually only released every 2 to 3 years? The answer is A LOT!! The good people at THQ and Yukes must have been working on this game before they released last year's not so special Smackdown vs. Raw. The bottom line is Smackdown '06 delivers the most realistic (or should I say true to life) wrestling experience to date. This game simply blows every other installment of the Smackdown franchise out of the water in ALL departments (graphics, sound, fighting system, season mode, and new features).Graphics - First of all, the graphics look like something that belongs on a next generation system. I don't know how they did it but the wrestlers look so much like their real life counter-parts it is down right spooky. The first time I saw Triple H pause and throw his bottle of water into the crowd I got goosebumps because you'd swear you were watching real footage. Also there is no visual drop-off in the quality of created superstars, which is a first. The crowd models look better than ever and on some entrances you actually can see the other wrestler in the ring waiting for you (depending on if the camera angle is right) making the entrances look like much more then canned animation sequences.Sound - Though most people don't by a wrestling game for it's sound the commentary is much better than it has ever been. It's still repetitive at times but even Madden games haven't solved that problem yet. The voice overs for the wrestlers are delivered much better then last years and created wrestlers can be assigned voices as well as a voiced, name and city for their entrance.Fighting System - Now down to the brass tacks. It may look and sound good but what about the fightin'?!! Fans of last year's game may be in for a disappointment this year because the overhauled fighting system is much more reminiscent of Smackdown: Here Comes The Pain in terms of pacing. The matches have been slowed down quite a bit to allow for a more tactical approach and to reflect the real pace of a real life match. The computer reverses moves much more than ever which can be frustrating at times but this simply forces players to use a little more variety in their tactics than they are use to. ALSO the biggest change is NO MORE ENERGY BARS. Matches are won by wearing down your opponent by targeting you attacks to a specific area of their body and by swing the momentum of a match (by dominating your opponent by chaining moves together and gaining crown approval). This fighting system, while slower and more deliberate, is true to life wrestling experience.Season mode - The season mode visuals are much better this year along with the previously mentioned voice-overs. Cut scenes look like something you'd see on a WWE program, with changing camera angles, and compelling acting (wink, wink). There are wrestler specific branches that should keep the repetition to a minimum.New Features - Finally there are more features than you can shake a barbed wires bat at. New match types including the buried alive format. A GM mode that mirrors the GM modes we've seen in other sports games and a beefed up online mode that supports 4 players and tradeable created wrestlers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2005"}

It is very noticeable when it is much higher but I do not put my chat volume over the game volume. If you do not care about hearing the game better and knowing whether or not someone is near you in a shooting game, do not buy this. I have not had these long enough to say if this breaks easily because people complain about that but you do need to take could care of it. The set-up takes 1 minute and very self-explanatory. If you play on a daily bases, you should buy this. For the people who are deciding whether to get the X11's or the PX21's, think about it this way. If you have a PS3, you need the PX21's because they are the only ones that support it and you should defiantly not get the P21's, they are not even close to as good as the PX21's. If you have and Xbox 360 and aren't looking to save 15 bucks on buying the cheaper x11's then chose the PX21's. They have more features and less of a buzzing sound. They also sound very good and it is easy to speak and be heard. If you need to save money, go for the x11's cause it is almost the same thing. Here are some of my pros and cons.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2012"}

So I gave it a try and its pretty awesome. You can walk around like in a Grand Theft Auto, and the rendering is stunning. Some of the best graphics I've played on PS3 yet. As far as the 3D image quality goes, I have an active shutter 3D TV and the 3D graphics are alright. I prefer playing without the 3D as its not that amazing. It pretty much pops some images in and out at you, and you. You can use this with either passive or active shutter by the way. And to set up 3D you just go to your options menu. I haven't heard any bad reviews on this game. People told me get this over uncharted 3 because I wanted a game with more story line and more to do.

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Gaming Fan xbox","summary":"The Witcher 2 - Game for us adults.","reviewText":"Wow when I was getting tired of games designed for preteens along comes The Witcher 2. I decided to pass on the PC version due to the fact I wasn't sure if my mid range comp could handle it. When they announced that The Witcher 2 was coming to Xbox I decided to take the long wait. I'm glad I did. This game is meant for adults. It's very graphic not only violence wise, but has very sexual elements to the game. Hide ya kids and hide ya wife whenever Geralt and Triss are alone lol. I had played through the first Witcher on PC and loved it. CD Project Red really stepped up with The Witcher 2. Game plays fantastic on the Xbox. The user interface is great. My only complaint I really have is the map is not really useful if you are trying to pinpoint accurately where you need to go.LIke I said the gameplay is fantastic. Weapons have actual weight to them, and it doesn't feel like your swinging at air (I'm looking at you Skyrim). The maps are very open for the most part, and you are pretty much free to explore whatever area you are in. The game is broken down into areas. You can't really leave that area until you have completed all the quests and progress the story. I have no problem with this element. Keeps me focused and I'm not wondering off and getting myself lost and completely abandoning the main story. TW2 has abundant amount of side quests too. Some are very lengthly in time and I love that.I would recommend TW2 to anyone who loves a mature story and setting. Who doesn't mind listening to dialog and actually making choices that change the games story permanently. It's a fantastic experience so far, and I can't wait to see what the rest of TW2 brings to the table.Also, this game is pretty much what other developers pass off as their 80 dollar special edition games. This is the most complete package I've ever gotten for a base price game. Soundtrack, handy 80 plus page quest guide, and foldout map. Buy it now, and help support more production of mature games. Us adults need to have some fun too!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

Game will ship with the disk secured on the sprocket and with bubblewrap and cardboard for protection. See my other listings for more uncommon PS2 titles.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the last great PS2 RPGs","reviewText":"Even though RPG's tend to be more \"nerd\"-centered, I always find playing them more funner than fighters or sports games because they always centered around an engrossing story. Sure a lot of them are far from innovative or new, but they're all the more interesting anyway. The story, presentation and the characters in Odin Sphere are quite memorable and it's surprising how fast you get suckered into the world. But like a lot of games, it's the gameplay that gets it knocked down a tad and while it's not an ever-present flaw, it's still one of those things you have to suffer in order to get to the good stuff.Story: You play a young girl who is reading books up in her attic. We then go inside the book's story and find ourselves in the world of Erion where the kingdom of Valentine fell victim to a creation of its own, the Crystallization Cauldron. Pretty soon, the Ringford fairies and the warriors of Ragnanival want it and are at odds. The game is separated into several books with their own chapters and acts and different characters.Graphics: I'm not kidding when I say this is probably one of the most loveliest and beautiful looking 2D games I've ever seen. With detailed sprites, bright color palettes and background animation meant to breathe life into the environment, the game is quite something to see in motion. The only problem comes when there's too many activity on screen and the sprites are a little bigger than usual (some are literally the height or length of the screen) so the game has slowdown.Sound/Music: Done by Hitoshi Sakamoto, the game is has some quite nice and memorable tunes which is kind of surprising because I wasn't too impressed with the Final Fantasy XII soundtrack. Also, a nice plus for those who love VA is an option for either English or Japanese. Even though the game in Japanese makes me think of a anime, I like keeping it in English which is good since, despite some occasional awkward readings, it's a solid job.Gameplay: This is where the game takes a dip. Done in a 2D rotating map where each section on the level acts as a 2D outline but really you're just going in circles, it's kind of neat to find a 2D RPG after so many 3D ones. It's pretty once you get the hang of it and the controls will eventually feel more comfortable. However it's the other parts of your character that are a nuisance. For example, now and then you get special items you can equip which can either net you more EXP when you get Phozons (kind of like MP in a way where you can fill a meter to unleash a special attack), or more attack power, or better chance for items being dropped. But you can only do one at a time and they're not separate from your item list so these things can take up space and since enemies can easily stomp you silly, that's not a good thing. Be prepared to throw away/use a lot of items to make room for others.Speaking of tough enemies, this game can easily hand you your *** if you're not careful. Sometimes they really pack a wallop or they can break your combos by somehow breaking through your attack and getting a lucky shot in. Then there's the bosses which can easily fill up a screen. To help in your fight you get special skills such as Phozon skills, items like Napalm. But some items hold special abilities such as different kinds of seeds where, when planted, will absorb surrounding Phozon which'll grow and bear health-giving fruit. Only sacrifice is that the Phozon charges your meter allowing for special attacks so it's kind of a trade off. Also another skill you pick up is Alchemy where you can combine items to create a better item or one with more potency.A game like Odin Sphere is like a lot of games that near the system's life cycle where barely anyone knows about it, let alone played it yet there's a group of people who played it and loved it. Odin Sphere might not get massive amounts of fans but we're just glad we have a great RPG to play, even if people are playing games on the big boys.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2007"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

But a few things held it back from true greatness. Here's my breakdown:Story:A genuinely interesting premise. You play Cole MacGrath-an average Joe turned into an electric powerhouse by a catasrophic explosion. You fail your attempt to escape the newly-quarantined Empire City and now must complete a task to earn your freedom. Along the way you'll make major decisions that will alter the city's survivors' perception of you, for better or worse.Score: 5/5Graphics/Setting:Empire City is big. It's spread into 3 district-islands that will unlock as you progress. Buildings look similar for the most part, save for the few memorable sections in each district. Despite this lack of architectural diversity, the graphics are pretty decent.Score: 3/5Combat:inFamous really shines here. Combat is essentially third-person shooter action but instead you'll use electrical powers. It's infinitely satisfying to annihilate opponents with destructive zaps, shock grenades, and lightning itself. You're awarded bonus XP for performing \"stunts\" in combat like head shots, 2-for-ones, blowing enemies off rooftops, etc. XP is then used for upgrading your stats and powers. These upgrades take a while, which encourages Stunts and almost forces you to get the most out of your encounters.Score: 5/5Quests:The main quest has you doing various and enjoyable missions. But I can't say the same for side missions. While the quantity is there, the quality is certainly not. You'll repeat similar quests far too often just for the sake of reducing enemy numbers in the immediate area. And there are tons of side missions. One other thing to do is collect shards. Finding enough will increase your electrical power capacity, but after finding a certain number, you'll max out your capacity. Remaining shards in the world are there purely for XP, reducing your desire to find them at all.Score: 3/5Karma:The big selling point of the game. You gain/lose karma for various actions and major decisions. Your karmic status does affect how people treat you on the streets. Some side quests are limited to karma status, and when you do one, the opposite karma quest disappears. Not to mention that your karma determines whether you'll have the good or evil version of your powers. Because of karma's influence on side quests and powers, you'll want to do 2 playthroughs to experience the game from good and evil stances. I just wish the karma system was a little deeper. The storyline won't change THAT much depending on your karma status. Just a few differences here and there.Score: 4/5Overall:inFamous excels with its combat and has a story you'll find interesting. But more creativity could've gone into building design and side quests, and the karma concept would've worked better if your decisions had even more impact on the story.Overall score: 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2013"}

Critical response (at least that which I read) to this expansion was generally positive, and so after a few months and a long-awaited price drop, I decided to try this out. I wish I had read the reviews here first.As it turns out, this is a weak and seemingly-hurried affair. Even for $25, it's not worth it (the quest is around 15 hours long the first time through with no guide, but significantly less after that).Strangely, despite the fact that I can't find much good with the title, I still give it two stars. The fact is, the \"Dragon Age\" universe is interesting enough that even poorly-constructed storylines such as this still manage to hold a modicum of fascination. I will confess that I was interested more in the subtle differences in scenes depending on the character I imported than with anything that the story gave to me, but even THIS had problems. So anyway,THE GOOD:1) It's Dragon Age. You get to see another part of Ferelden. Sure, it looks like every other part of Ferelden you saw before, but it's something. I guess. Honestly, the coolest thing about the game was getting the armor and weapons that Master Wade created. The sword even gets its own ending sequence.THE BAD:1) What a glitch-filled mess. I have no idea if the downloaded version is better, but this version is just pathetic, technically speaking. First, you have to accept a patch to play it. For even, even though I had a LATER patch, the game (when played online) still prompted me to take the earlier patch. What a joke.Hilariously, if you are using armor from other DLC, when starting up \"Awakenings,\" you'll be in...your underwear. That's right - \"Awakenings\" doesn't like your earlier DLC. It's hilarious to see your hero of Ferelden in little more than a birthday suit to start his second quest.In addition, many of your codex entries will be deleted. The game still seems to recognize that you have them, but you can't read them in \"Awakenings\" (the biggest offenders are the \"quest-related\" entries from the original \"DA:O\"). There are other glitches - lots of them, in fact, but you get the picture. More of the same from Bioware. &lt;cue eyeroll>2) One of the great things about this game should have been the ability to import previous characters. Unfortunately, this is screwed up as well. The manual clearly states that you can import dead characters and they will be alive. That's an...odd design decision (particularly given Bioware's stance on their \"Mass Effect\" franchise), but whatever.What is even stranger is that many of the decisions you've made won't even register in the new expansion. For example, I imported a rogue who allied with Loghain and sided with Anora in \"DA:O\". Yet, who came to greet me in \"Awakenings\"? King Alistair, of course. When last I left Alistair, he was presumed to be a derelict living out his remaining days in drunken misery. Apparently, he's now king. Good one.3) Who thought up this ridiculous story? It literally makes my head hurt. In what world would the Grey Wardens even CONSIDER teaming up with the Darkspawn? This crap is weak for a JRPG, for crying out loud. I don't really want to say more, for fear of spoiling the story, but honestly, you WANT to have this nonsense spoiled. Trust me.It's always a bad idea to ask for someone to overact insanity, but whoever does the voice for \"The Mother\" (very original) really takes this to the nth degree. The Architect is slightly better, but enough of the calm tactician. These are Darkspawn, people.Anyway, that's it. I suppose any of the bad comments could double for ugly comments as well, but long story short, this might be worth $10 later on. More than that, and it just fails to satisfy.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Keith Doyle","summary":"Xenosaga's Brief 2nd Chapter","reviewText":"The reviews given by Amazon authors Joe Juba and Matt Miller are spot-on.  Xenosaga Episode II is very short for an RPG.  And yes, the gameplay has been altered in a negative way.  However, any fan of Xenosaga is obligated to play this game.  Episode II contains exciting and emotional cut scenes, offers further development of the main characters and continues a deep yet interesting storyline.  Just be prepared for a few inferior modifications.I, too, was disappointed with the change in voice actors, but I saw it coming and therefore wasn't overly bothered by it.  Not everyone sounds different; I only noticed Shion and KOS-MOS with different voices.  Thankfully, the characters' mannerisms and speech patterns have been left intact.  To me, that's what's important.Another noteworthy downgrade is the music.  Episode I had a full symphony orchestra (with chorus) for it's soundtrack!  Not so with Episode II.  The music isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing that makes me want to buy the soundtrack CD, unlike the first game.  The sound effects are pretty much unchanged.If you want to collect everything the game has to offer you must take on the optional sub-missions, called GS (Good Samaritan) Campaigns.  There are 36 of them, some of which are quite lengthy.  The time spent on these sub-missions is equal to, if not longer, than the main quest!  There's also Segment Files to discover, which Xenosaga veterans are familiar with.  They should have named this game's title Side-Questsaga.Also, can anyone tell me why Episode II comprises two disks?  Episode I is only ONE disk, yet it has more cut scenes and is twice as long!  I suppose Episode III will comprise THREE disks and only be 1/3 as long as the first game..!  It's puzzling...Oh, and why no database in this Xenosaga?  Episode I had a useful database of facts the player could access any time to keep track of all the terms, items and significant events in the game.  It was stupid to drop that feature.  There IS a brief recap of the events from Episode I available to read, but it doesn't make up for a missing database.The one, single improvement over the first game is the removal of the mail/plug-in module system.  I found it annoying trying not to miss any of the items and information offered by the mail system attachments.  I was glad to see it go in Episode II.Despite all the negatives, Xenosaga Episode II is still worth playing, at least for fans of Episode I.  Let's just hope for a grander epic in Episode III.  There's plenty to improve at this point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2005"}

Either don't grind and face incredibly hard bosses but still beatable with the right strategy and skills or grind and make life easier at the end.Yeah you can't save in dungeons but grind, go back out and save, grind go back out and save and repeat.

It has great graphics that really add to the enjoyment of playing the game. Anything that you see on the screen you can get to, and with the great draw distance of the game you can see a lot. You use your grappling hook and parachute to climb anything and everything. There are also over 100 vehicles to drive and fly. The one downside to the graphics is the damage on the vehicles. It just doesn't look that realistic. Other than that the graphics are a thing of beauty. The island looks amazing as you travel to snow capped mountains or just run through a field and watch the grass fly through the air with great detail.The grappling system is amazing and super easy to use. You simply aim at a building, or tree, or well anything you can think of and you get pulled to it with a push of a button. The parachute also works really well and you can use the grapple to pull yourself along while gliding. The gun play system is pretty easy. There is a slight auto aim in the game and it is rather easy to shoot up the enemy forces. I do wish that they would have put different types of weapons in. You have a pistol, assault rifle, and sub-machine gun throughout the entire game. There are no different weapons to really choose from. Even if you had a choice of different machine guns it would have been ok, but you only have the one type of gun. Next time put an M16, Ak 47, among others so that we can choose.The island is huge and there are a lot of things to see. The only thing is that for every unique location there is a duplicate settlement around the hill. The military bases and settlements are copied over and over again with some slight variations on their design. Also you can't go in any buildings so exploration is really not that fun after awhile. There is for the LOST fans a special easter egg hidden in Panau that is fun to find. I just wish they would have added some interiors or at least more variety in the villages and bases themselves.The missions are your typical fare. There are side missions and story missions. You have to do the side missions in order to unlock the main quest missions though. The story in both cases is weak. You basically are hired to kill, hijack, or blow someone or something up. The mission locales are varied enough to keep you interested though, as the actual missions are fun and enjoyable to play. There are about 55 missions in total and should last at least 20 hours to complete. The story missions are more enjoyable than the side missions, but unfortunately there are only 7 of them in the game. Don't expect great storytelling as the developers went for a B movie plot instead of an actual in depth one. The voice acting doesn't help as all of these voice actors should never be hired for another role for the rest of their lives. Their broken English is a constant annoyance, and is the main reason that even the story that exists is a bad one as you have to suffer through the terrible audio.You can call in vehicles and equipment via helicopter. It is similar to the Mercenaries series. You just find an open spot, pull up your pda, and order your equipment. The only complaint I have is that you have to watch the stupid helicopter fly in every time you call him. After you see it a few times you just wish you could automatically skip it.This is a game that should be experienced by fans of the genre. It is not perfect nor should anyone say it is. The story is lacking and the island itself should be given more thought next time, but it is fun to play. I got over 20 hours of enjoyment out of this game and if you are one of those people who like to one hundred percent a game you will be playing this game forever as there are tons of things to blow up and collect on the island. If you like sandbox open world shooters then I recommend this game, just don't expect the story to blow you away. After all this is a great game to just pick up and play when you're bored. I look forward to the next title in the series to make even further advancements on this stable foundation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

I needed a good, long, challenging RPG to last me for some time (so I don't have to buy MW2).My expectations have been high and, well, I have to say, Dragon Age: Origins is better than almost every other CRPG out there, with maybe a select few exceptions (Oblivion jumps to mind).First, I want to get something out of the way, this game is certainly not for everyone, its only for a specific audience. If you have never played an RPG before, can't pay attention to an excellently written dialog for more than a few seconds, and can't go three minutes without shooting someone on your Xbox360 or PS3 or whatever you have...this game will bore you to death...trust me. Otherwise, GET THIS GAME!Personally, I find this game alot better than Neverwinter Nights, just because, the combat system is better. No more of that \"Turn-based Realtime Tactical Combat,\" now its purely real-time, and of course, you can pause the game and issue comands whenever you feel like it. To be honest, though, in comparison to Neverwinter Nights, there were definately far fewer magical spells...that's not really saying much, though, because NWN had a mind-boggling amount of spells. In fact, at times, the combat may become a little WOW-style grinding, although this rarely happens.The reason why you'll keep on playing is not becuase of the combat, though, it is because of the excellent plot and characters! They are simply fantastic (especially Alistair). Never in a game will you find more beleveable and relatable characters...EVER, until Mass Effect 2...You can build up relations with characters that will change the way they react to you, and frankly, you'll find yourself talking to the characters voluntarily even if you didn't originially intend to...IT'S THAT GOOD! The most surprising thing about the story is how different each play through can be depending on the choices you make, including your Origin Story (look these up on google).Graphics, cool, ambient occusion...nice...not excellent, just good...the PC version is the best, but if you have no other option get the PS3 version over the Xbox360.The game is long...about 60 hours for a single no-thrills playthrough, if you ingnore all side-quests and don't build up any relations...don't have any sex...etc.All in all, Dragon Age is worth $40, in fact it could be worth $100 considering how much play time you can get out of it.Gameplay - 9 / 10Story - 10 / 10Graphics - 8 / 10Value - 10 / 10Overall - 9.5 / 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2009"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Craig Moller","summary":"A hell of a fright!","reviewText":"It's clear as you play through Project Origin that Monolith has spent some time thinking about the science of horror. With a goal to walk a delicate tight rope with the game's design - to ensure that the transitions between straight-up shooting and a foreboding, malevolent atmosphere with semi-frequent scares is executed with style. It's a line that the team has managed to tread with some aplomb. Project Origin may have its weaknesses, but in terms of its blend of shooter and horror, it has the weighting just right. Backing up the general melting of reality that is Project Origin's horror motifs, is a rock solid shooter.There's an awful lot to like, however. There's a much greater variety in locales than in the original, and the way you progress through the world is excellent. The story is really well handled and intriguing too. There's regular radio chatter from your team mates and other characters, as well as intel pick-ups that fill you in on Alma, Armacham, Replica soldiers and everything else. Perhaps most impressive is the city itself. You arrive on the surface a while after the explosion, in a dilapidated warehouse with a car embedded halfway through a second storey wall, with most of its corrugated iron roof panels missing, exposing a muddy brown, broken sky. The sound design is every bit as good as the visual design, if not better. From roaring rushes and pained moans, to frenzied whispers in your ear as you creep down a corridor, HUD juddering, the effects do wonders for the atmosphere. So too does the strong soundtrack.In the end, Project Origin is a fantastic piece of work and deserves to be applauded in many ways. Taking the original much loved game and transforming it into a suspenseful, adrenaline pumping sequel. A very entertaining game that ought to be tested and highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HIC8","description":"","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"We're Not in Azeroth, but It Sure Looks Like The Ugly Cousin","reviewText":"If you've played any recent MMO on the market, Rift needs no introduction.  Welcome to the new persistent game world of Telara, where you battle against the evil Regulos either as a Guardian (Holy Rollers), or Defiant (Atheists).Class system:Rift only has four classes or \"callings\" Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric.  However each class has a total of 8 sub classes, and three of them can be chosen at any time.  The classes are very dynamic, and allow for certain classes to do fill in roles they normally wouldn't fill.  In Rift, you can expect to see a Rogue tank a dungeon, a Mage to be the main healer, and a Cleric to do pretty much anything.  Along with a dynamic class system is the allowance to change specializations on the fly, so if one guy is tanking a boss one round, he could switch to healing the next, or dps afterwards.Questing: 1-50If you like the grind of Korean Free-To-Play RPGs, Rift offers this to you until max level.  Quests are set up to run in a linear fashion from one area to the next in a timely manner.  Each has several quest hubs which consist of \"Kill X number of bad guys\", \"Pick up X number of items\".  After a mini-boss fight of one area, you move on to the next.  The initial starting zones of Defiant and Guardians have a pretty unique story line that if followed, can be pretty interesting.  However the novelty of this wears off at level 10, and quests are literally done in the same fashion until 50.Rifts:Hence the title of the game, Rifts randomly spawn all across Telara in the leveling zones.  There are several types of rifts, however the objective is the same for every one. Kill X number of enemies.  Rifts then go into bonus rounds where you are timed to kill them.  Invasions are when the zone is being attacked by a swarm of rifts, and it is up to everyone in the zone to group together and defeat the invasion.  If successful, invasions take over quest hubs and towns.  This can be fun if you are new to public quest systems or working with your guild to defeat them, but mostly they become annoying when you're leveling characters. On PvP servers, it is especially annoying to take on rifts as the enemy faction will impede your progress than help out.Post 50 Progression:After level 50, your character then begins the reputation grind for certain specialty gear, crafting quests, daily quests, and of course dungeons and raiding.  Dungeons are broken down into normal, tier 1, and tier 2.  Each level of dungeon becomes more and more challenging, and are usually a good time thanks to the scripted fights and tough class mechanics.  However, there are still many bugs on certain bosses, and it can actually be more of a nuisance than a good time when a boss will reset without warning.  After dungeons come 10-man raid, and of course expert raiding.  Expert raids are 20-man, require a certain amount of gear from tier dungeons, and are heavily scripted for challenge.  You can queue for dungeons in any area, at any time, however dungeons are not cross-realm, thus you will wait in a queue for hours before getting picked .If all of this sounds familiar to you because you've played World of Warcraft, Lord of the Rings Online, Warhammer, or almost any other modern MMO, that's because it is.  Rift doesn't offer anything better for the MMO community, only more of the same with a bit more graphical polish.  I personally waited until I experienced raid content before reviewing, as most MMO veterans always say to hit max level before you judge a game.  The leveling process was a hard pill to swallow, but at 50, I really enjoyed the dungeons, especially Greenscale raiding.  However this was mostly due to the guild I was in.  I had joined another guild earlier during my leveling, and I was disheartened to see a large guild of max level players, with over 70% of its people base missing in action for two weeks.  I was told many guilds on the server were turning into this; players simply played the first month of their subscription and called it quits.  After checking the forums on Rift's 50+ servers, it was apparent my server wasn't alone in the epidemic.Rift stuff to like about it, but it's not all glamorous.  Rift doesn't allow add-ons, nor has an adequate damage meter.  Patches are coming out that will eventually allow this, but this could have been a big seller for coders who like to tweak game UIs or give utility to things like the Auction House.  Rift has some nasty in-game glitches that require you to log out from the client, or get you stuck in a rift.  The targeting system for enemies is very poor, and misclicks abound in dungeons that result in accidental pulls.  Zones are cramped, with enemies constantly knocking characters off their mount with a slow debuff.  The worst has to be the questing system.  Even at max level, daily quests repeat the same dreaded grind players did to get to that level, but now earn reputation for it.  Nothing can be done to grind this reputation, it has to be done in order to get the best gear.MMO enjoyment is all about community and content.  I know plenty of WoW players in my day who would log on just to be bored, because that was their community; their virtual home.  I got luckily and found a good group of people who genuinely love the game despite its flaws.  Rift doesn't offer you anything different, just another community, and an arduous level grind.  The end-game is fun for dungeons and raids, however getting into raids require lots of avid players, which of course is a dwindling commodity as many continue to quit.  Rift sure isn't Azeroth, but it certainly plays like a red-headed cousin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

I played maleYet, all 3 thought I was \"the best thing since sliced bread\" ?I basically used the same trio, unless the game required otherwise.Now, I played it 6 times ... 2-Light; 2-Dark; 2 just going solo(... one each way).Found it more enjoyable to just forgo the dialogue/ character relationship options.I simply pumped up my skills with cheats which were equivalent to what my party member would have had.This way, I had no \"ending letdown\".Now, if you don't really care about character followthrough, as it relates to your decisions/dialogue choices and what/how the ending would look like, then it's a 5 star game.I wanted an ending to match the time I took in developing \"my story/decisions/choices\"; sadly, I felt cheated.-----* creating a lightsaber ?* forced to use other NPC ?* was there a romantic relationship ... I couldn't really tell ?* some dialogue options were unchanged from nearly the first meeting ?* influence-success/failure ... didn't notice much of a difference ... seemed it was my character's Good/Evil that determined the endings ?* my character(s) looked to be 30yrs old or so, yet one female NPC called me \"too old\" for her ?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2006"}

This has incredible replay value, a 40+ hour adventure that you'll want to replay over and over again. Plus finding all the game's secrets takes an additional 10+ hours.

I will say that the shooting can feel a bit stiff this time around but supposedly they're working on a patch to make it feel more like Uncharted 2. I really only feel it's a problem when I'm shooting someone really far away.The visuals are perfect and toward the end the game has some pretty stylized scenes involving the desert.  The story is interesting and it seriously leaves you on the edge of your seat.  This time around I feel there is a sense of mortality that the previous games had.  Before Drake was just lucky and things worked out his way, this time it's so extreme it's almost like a super-hero ability but after every scene Nathan really comes off as having just survived death.  It adds something to the experience.I will also note, I feel this game might be a bit more difficult than the previous games.  I beat the game on hard and I feel I had to restart as many gunfights as I had to on Crushing in Uncharted 2.  If you plan on getting that Platinum expect a decent challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Disappointing, Frustrating, and Too Short (again)","reviewText":"Some improvements from Final Fantasy XIII, like we get out of all caves and dungeons, but other inexplicable regressions that angered me ... leading me to think, why did I pay real money for this second-class game?In Final Fantasy XIII, you had a group of adventurers you could play with and improve (they didn't all play at the same time, but still). Here? You only have TWO! What in the world were the creators thinking -- that we don't like large parties, mutiple characters and personalities, etc? Or that we would really rather just add some creature to personalize the party? Nonsense. The party here is adjustable to your taste, but so what, if all the creatures are so much weaker than your enemies that it's almost pointless to bother ... You can strengthen them, you say? Yeah, you can; but by the time you can do it in any meaningful way, the game will already be over. You'll have beaten it. My Pulse Knight and Cait Sith were captured and improved shortly after the system was taught to me, and I found no need to replace them afterwards. Get a good sentinal to suck up attacks, a good healer to restore you, and a good saboteur to weaken your enemies, and you'll find that collecting other creatures is pretty much a pointless activity. You fight with Snow for a while, but then he disappears. What the heck?Second problem I have is with the experience/levelling up system itself. Why is there so little difference between beasts? Beat one group of little, weak creatures, you get 100 or 200 points. Beat a group of strong creatures, or one massive enemy, and get ... maximum 500 or so? what? pointless. Then there is an area in the game where you can just stand and get assaulted by groups of pretty weak enemies for 400-500 points a battle, easily enabling you to level up quickly. Do that for an hour or so and you've got 40,000 points and are well are your way to beating any enemy the game has in store for you.Third problem I found is the progression of the game itself: you can't just play battle to battle, region to region. You have to collect items \"artifacts,\" some of which are practically invisible, and others that can't be accessed until you travel to a certain area, and talk to a certain character, etc. Often (particularly in the later stages) you will find yourself looking for an item in an area that will not be there because you haven't triggered a character yet. Even worse, sometimes someone will ask you to obtain an object you've already unwittingly discovered somewhere, and you will search the game over looking for what you've already found (ug, click again on a character after accepting a mission to avoid this unpleasantness), or they will ask you to get something you can't get, because a \"gate\" has yet to be unlocked to allow you to get to the place where it's hidden. Or hey, you can get it, but you have to get on a Chocobo to reach that area, didn't you know that?The mini-puzzles are just plain stupid. Is this a Final Fantasy game, or a brainteaser exercise?The game is smaller in scope than the previous one. A handful of areas, really. And fewer creatures, and many of them just as silly as in previous games. I'm tired of fighting dumb-looking peguin-lookin' things and erasers with hula-hoops around them and cartoonish cacti and etc. Really? Is this the best they can do? A friggin dancing mushroom?And what happened to improving your weapon, or defensive abilities?Final complaint is the battle you win, only to have to fight again repeatedly. You beat Caius once only to have to fight him again immediately after. Then he restores his health completely and you must again defeat him (no saving allowed between these battles). Beat him (at the end of the game), and you have three dragon-like enemies, two of which keep resurrecting. No, Final Fantasy people, that stuff's not fun. Just angering. Make one really hard enemy if you must, but stop with these tricksey fights. They make me want to push my tv out the window. It's also not a lot of fun to fight enemies that, no matter how strong you get, can wipe out your whole party with one hit with spells/attacks you don't have access to, that you can't learn.What's better: a more layered environment, more interactive than Final Fantasty XIII. More possibilities for play once the main quest is finished. Mog. The ability to \"tame\" creatures to fight on your side.What's worse: the story, the bad cut scenes, the combat system, the puzzle aspect(which does not make the game more enjoyable, but just prolongs the agony), the music, the levelling-up system ... and much more.Final word: the better Final Fantasy game was what? ten? Twelve? They should be getting better as time goes on, not worse. Come on, people.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000AVBFU8","reviewerName":"Ladysuki1289","summary":"My Favorite Tales~!","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying....Tales of Legendia is NOT made by Tales Studio. It's made by the folks that bring the Soul Calibur games to life, so for the differences that people see between this game and any other Tales game, that is why. A different studio worked on this game.But that doesn't make Tales of Legendia any less amazing; actually, I think that makes it more unique and able to stand on its own. Tales of Legendia is unlike ANY Tales in the ENTIRE flagship series and that is both a blessing and a curse. The cutesy 2D avatars do look a little odd after playing games like Tales of Symphonia or Tales of the Abyss, but I assure you, Legendia is very much worth the purchase. And if nothing else, all Tales fans should buy this game just to show Baba-san that the West supports the series and very much wants Tales to succeed in the States.Anyway, I won't rehash on the story because all the other reviewers covered it. What I will say is that ToL has one of the BEST casts in all of the Tales games, and you will fall in love with each and every one of them. My favorite Tales character of all time is Chloe Valens, the knight who fell from grace after her parents were killed.

{"product_name":"B002I0EMUO","description":"Product OverviewFrom the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, a new 3D   experience re-imagined from one of the most popular Metal Gear Solid   titles from the    past, comes METAL GEAR SOLID SNAKE EATER 3D.In the aftermath of the Second World War, the world was torn in two   between East and West. It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War.October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word   that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world    trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer.   After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th   to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake.FeaturesExperience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, previously released on      PlayStation 2 with over 4 million copies sold, in 3D for the first time ever.Auto-stereoscopic 3D viewing capability that endeavors to create a rich jungle world with natural depth in      settings of trees, rock/stone, water and more.'Photo Camo' system utilizing the built-in camera technology of the   hardware bringing customized stealth      and camouflage options to the player.

P. Jesus","summary":"That frame rate...","reviewText":"Okay so Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is probably the best game in the MGS series, even better than Twin Snakes.  So why is this port just okay?Well the first problem with Metal Gear Solid 3D: Snake Eater is unless you have one of those silly Circle Pad Pros, the controls are unwieldy.  They use the D pad to do what the face buttons should be doing.  Which is awkward and too bad because this game is actually modeled after Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence, not Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater.  In Snake Eater (and also Sons of Liberty) you don't really need a second analog stick.  Those games are practically top down and control very much like Metal Gear Solid did on the first PlayStation.  If Konami had remade Snake Eater for the 3DS instead of Subsistence we wouldn't have needed the Circle Pad Pro at all.  Who knows, they may have even been able to lock down the choppy frame rate in this version of MGS3.  Which is the other problem with this 3DS port.  Talk about a missed opportunity.Those are two pretty big things holding this game back but it's still the same content with a few new Easter eggs thrown in and a create your own camouflage mode using the 3DS camera that I found to be an extremely fun and addictive feature.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2014"}

Seeing the outside world, with the sun lightly hitting the water. The afternoon sky just brimmed, yet the sun is already setting. It's completely beautiful.You've probably read enough about Oblivion by now. I think the most important thing to note however is that Oblivion is not necessarily suppose to be played straight through.Morrowind was a fantastic game. I never even got to finish it because it was so long. It was long and epic, just the way I like it. Oblivion seems much shorter. The reason for this mainly is instant travel. You can travel anywhere instantly. This feature is useful and very easy, yet I try to walk most places. The environment in the game is astounding. Everything looks so vibrant and spectacular, which makes it enjoyable to play. The graphics aren't necessarily as good as Half-life 2, but there are so many textures, plants, and trees that no area looks fake. One of the greatest additions to the game was the sky effects. Walking around the snowy regions of the game as the sky is getting darker... Great. The dungeons are also good. They usually have an ancient feel to them, and it's always fun seeing the nice traps set up.Another small pro that I have to point out is the physics engine. You can knock any item over. If you see a piece of bread in a bowl, you can push that stuff off the table. Sometimes I'll accidentally walk too close to a table and I'll knock some stuff off. It's kind of interesting.There are some cons to the game. For one, if you just do the main quest, you're going to beat it quickly. If you just teleport everywhere, you could probably beat the main quest in 1/30th of the time it took to do morrowind's main quests.Another con, you need a great machine to run it. It's crashed quite a few times for me now.Still, I can't complain about much else. The world feels underpopulated to me, but that adds a more adventurous type feel to the game. Also, the game is fully voice acted, which adds another layer of character development. Everything the characters say somehow add to the game.I would recommend this game, but only if you like the original Morrowind and only if you have time to kill.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2006"}

It's little things like this that boggle my mind that Sony didn't think of leading up to the release of the PS4.UPDATED: If you start a private voice conversation with no one it will mute the camera in multiplayer games.UPDATE 2: As of Firmware 1.6 you can mute the camera mic.I got this camera because when I live stream I want people to be able to see my face (I play with my face because I'm disabled so people will want to see that in action) and the camera works well for that and in that purpose. You can also turn the console on and do numerous commands with the voice functionality. And while nowhere near as refined as Microsoft's Kinect is I think in time it can be very useful.Now the mini games that come with it (I mean come with your PS4) are kind of cool and the types of games that you show off to your friends when you want to show them how far technology has come. But after a few times you will really play that are again. And how games will take advantage of video technology remains to be seen a big way.But for live streaming and showing face cams this is definitely a useful product. And it works straight out the box and is super easy to set up.So all in all I think it's a cool albeit niche product for many people.Thanks for reading.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"A.

I was right!  Not only that, but the game is too hard to figure out.  I'm stuck somewhere I can't get out of... some kind of jungle.  I've gone everywhere I can think of.  The game isn't that fun to play anyway, and the graphics aren't that great for a PS2 game.  The only thing I liked is you get to meet all the characters from the Final Fantasies up to that point, though some looked pretty bad.  They also seemed to transfer the bright blue eyes of the main character to Final Fantasy: Crisis Core for the PSP.  Now that game is at least entertaining.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00007KQE9","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A great game!","reviewText":"Well, I have sunk some solid time into DW4, and I am quite impressed. No, KOEI didn't deliver as much as I expected, but when your expectations were as high as mine, you can't expect perfection (notice I still gave this 5 stars!).What's good about DW4 is actually great. KOEI decided that it would finally have normal enemies do damage to your character and attack you en masse, rather than wait for you to kill off whoever you were fighting at the time. This has the effect of making the game much more exciting; you must constantly change your perspective so that you don't get ambushed by another officer/grunt. Also, it is no longer possible to immediately run through and get every character's most powerful weapon (as was the case in DW3 and Xtreme Legends). Instead, you must play with one character long enough to power up his initial weapon (via a weapon experience system) before the fabled level 10 weapon can be obtained. Also, officers sometimes duel with you, and these duels are immensely fun, and are often times just as nervewracking as a 30-1 battle! There are multiple storylines, multiple movies, and hidden Musou missions for Lu Bu, Yuan Shao, Dong Zhuo, etc. The graphics are very nice (although this was never a problem with DW3), and the gameplay is top notch.Where the game disappoints is in its use of its advertised Siege Engine. KOEI had promised a more strategic element, where the player could use catapults, battering rams, etc. in order to get a tactical advantage over his opponent. However, this fails to deliver; really, the only advantage of using the Siege Engine elements is the ability to see some cut scenes. I mean, this is nice, but it isn't strategical. I was a bit disappointed here.However, this game continues to be the best hack-n-slash battle simulation on the market. I strongly urge any fan of the original to buy this, as well as anyone who just wants to have some mindless fun. However, if you were intrigued by the possibility of a more mental engagement, this game isn't for you. I hope that KOEI does better with the Siege Engine in the next installment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2003"}

SC4 is no different. The game has almost everything I could ask for. Custom character setup has been greatly improved.

I also like the addition of Star Wars characters (especially Apprentice Starkiller).The different skill sets in the game makes the game very deep and gives it a lot of replay value. The game even has a new and improved boss from the last SC game. One thing that I miss is the Battle Theater mode and Exhibition Theater mode. For some unknown reason, these two modes, which were in every single SC game before SC4 have now been removed. The game could also use a few more stages and more clothing for the Star Wars characters. As a matter of fact, I would have loved to see a Force Gauge skill set for Star Wars characters. If your character has Force Gauge A then his Force Gauge will never deplete.

I just picked it up again this week and have probably spent about 20-25 hours on it.The Graphics: The graphics are obviously kid friendly cartoon graphics, but they are very well done and the game is really colorful and bright. Wonderful graphics.The Sound: The sound is not that great. The voices are annoying and the music gets extremely repetetive, but you could always turn off the sound and listen to your own music.The Characters: The characters all look different, but they all talk the same - like little kids. Overall, they are okay but there is no character depth whatsoever.Story: Basic Zelda story - a girl gets kidnapped and you have to collect pearls and go to different temples, then beat the end guy and save the girl. But this time it is your sister that is kidnapped. The story is really boring.The Gameplay: This game can get extremely boring at times. The puzzles are not hard at all. The bosses are kind of fun to beat, but that's all that's good. My biggest beef with this game is that you have to spend a REALLY LONG TIME boating to different islands, and it gets so boring you could scream and smash your paddle. You probably spend 3/4 of the time in the game sailing on the open sea, collecting heart pieces or just getting to the next objective. And you have to change the wind direction every half minute.Overview: This game uses pretty much the same elements from the Ocarina of Time, except for the excruciatingly boring rides across the sea. The graphics are wonderful, if a little childish. The gameplay is not for young children, as they will probably become very frustrated very soon. If you are looking for a game that will take you a long time to conquer, then get this game. But if you are looking for straight action then look for Viewtiful Joe or something.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2004"}

The game has the old wii sports of bowling and golf as well as Wii's play of ping pong, but now you can skydive, sword fight, fly airplanes, do archery, wakeboarding, play Frisbee, basketball, canoeing, jet skiing, or ride a bicycle course tournament all these games for your enjoyment.  The wii motion plus is incredible in it's reading movement of your remote, when you make a movement with the wii remote it's action is perfectly matched on the game from moving left to right to the turning of the wrist.  Also you can as with Wii sports use your own mii during game play and as with Wii sports after each resort game if you win and depending on the points or skill you've achieved after the game will raise your skill level points until you reach the position of professional in that game area you've done.  The game is just as addictive as Wii sports and Wii Play are and as pretty obvious as it is it's much more fun when you're playing with another person or persons.  The one thing you must have though is the Wii motion plus item for each remote the game won't let you play without this item as it will need to read the connection setting balance of the motion plus, my friend also got this game and had another person over to play with him but since he only had on motion plus when the second player tried to connect the message he got was \"Cannot find connection of motion plus settings\" and after that would only see the one remote.  Also you may have to buy a couple more nunchuck contollers as about three of the games require it(Archery, Cycling,and Jet skiing), if you do have to buy some more nunchuck controllers though just stick with the standard Nintendo ones while there are wireless ones that can now be bought I've learned from personal experience that it's not worth the headache or money to own one of these.

Once you get past the first opening cutscene (which is awesome, and does get you pumped up)it doesn't really go anywhere, \"go here save, save this, kill them\", there's only one more emotional cutscene but isn't nearly as good. Even for a regular game, the graphics are poor, which leads to gaming annoyances, and the animations suck as well.Gameplay/game mechanics, for a AAA title and a even a regular title are poor as well, 0 innovation whats so ever, complete copy 100% of Call of Duty, from the exact button layout, actions, and that slowed down moment where everything is in slow motion and you shoot everyone, annoying/unfair deaths, and lack of ammo for a specific type of gun. The sp is also extremely linear, and has some frustrating moments and deaths due to poor level design.Finally, the ending, I had also heard about the bad ending in the review but didn't know it was this bad, I pretty much said, \"Wtf? That's it? That was really short.\" The last level as always is crazy, but there's no spectacular finish, it's kinda like, you're going up, but than start falling and you still have the feeling that your going up because you never got to the top, you never got your fill, if that makes sense. Pretty much, it ends abruptly, and they should've changed the title to, \"Homefront: Part 1\" because it obviously sets up for a Homefront 2 which I will laugh at because if they don't turn Part 2 upside down revamped, no one will buy it. But I recommend renting it for a few days as it is kind of fun, and there are some good moments.Mp, was really hoping this would be good and the reason if I was gonna buy it, matches are kinda fun, but there's so many things that I don't like about it, bad annoying deaths, sniper glitches, your name showing up above you so you can see the enemy and he can see you, bad spawning, bad graphics which doesn't help in telling if the guy you're looking at is your teammate or not or if it's just a rock (yes, that did happen), if you suck at the game you won't be able to progress to get enough battle points to get something to get more battle points, no zoom on sniper rifles, no demolition class that comes with a rocket launcher to deal with enemy vehicles so you're pretty much screwed for a bit if they decided to bring in a tank.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"Computerdude1032","summary":"A fun game, but some major flaws prevent it from really soaring","reviewText":"As someone who has some experience with the guitar, I was very intrigued by the idea of GUITAR HERO with a real guitar.  Most people will be relieved to hear that this game does what it sets out to do and teaches guitar successfully.  This game does the majority of things very well but a few issues keep me from awarding it 5 stars:1) Inability to customize difficulty.  The auto scaling difficulty was frustrating because I have had previous experience with guitar and was getting sick of the watered-down version of play that everyone starts on.  I was anxious to scale up to more realistic guitar play, but never scaled up soon enough.  I feel that the game should let players choose a difficulty or the developers should tune the auto scaling of the difficulty differently.2) Colorblind individuals may experience some difficulty as each string has a color associated with it and the colors chosen are close enough to each other to confuse.  Also, the screen is laid out in an inverted form of guitar tablature and may lead to more confusion if you have previous experience with tablature.3) The pacing of the game could use some work.  Although similar game pacing is present in games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero, this game is slower in pace.  In career mode, you have the choice to play ~2 songs until the ~5 songs in the set are complete.  Then to progress, you are forced to play the five songs in uninterrupted succession with encore songs added at the end.  This can lead to fatigue and sometimes sucks the fun out of the experience.Although great game, I worry of the consequences of learning from this game as I felt as if I was using a different part of my brain playing Rocksmith than when I was playing guitar on my own.  I felt this game was more of a reflex game where playing guitar is more than that.  Although I may seem to be criticizing the game harshly, there absolutely are many great moments where you are actually playing the full guitar part for a song you enjoy and those moments are the real enjoyment of the experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing.  At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc.  If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been \"simcitied out,\" save your money and buy another title.

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"The Belmont Dynasty Lives On!","reviewText":"Alright, the very first thing I'm going to say is this:  those of you who came into this game with a jaded mindset, thinking that it was going to be like all the other Castlevania titles, should really be ashamed of yourselves for giving this game low marks.  Your bad reviews for this game should never be taken into consideration because you let your biased opinions get in the way of your judgment.  Lords of Shadow is NOT like any other Castlevania game, and it must be judged on its own.Secondly, those of you who give this game sub-par reviews for its lack of originality and \"derivative gameplay\" should also be chastised severely.  Yes, it borrows from previous titles (God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, etc.), but SO WHAT?  It WORKS.  It's a great game with an awesome storyline...enough said.  The graphics are beautiful, the cutscenes are gorgeous, and you really get the most bang for your buck.  LoS clocks in at between 15 and 20 hours worth of gameplay, and it's enough to actually keep you interested.  Until the day comes when a \"new\" style of gameplay is introduced, we just have to deal with this type of action-combat-hack n slash format.  So just deal with it, learn to love it, and shut up!One last comment that I'd like to make about Lords of Shadow refers to the voice acting.  All of the major actors play great roles and read their lines well...BUT, I'm a little annoyed at Patrick Stewart's performance.  His presence in this game was actually the number one reason that caused me to purchase LoS...me being a huge Star Trek: The Next Generation fan and all.  But I must say that Patrick should have read his lines with a little more emotional \"oomph\" during the opening scroll scenes for the chapters. During those introductory scenes, it just feels as if he falls flat when saying certain lines, with a couple of long and drawn out sections.Also, my favorite word that I LOVE hearing him say is \"artifacts.\"  Not ONCE did he mention this word in the game!  In the scroll scenes, the word \"relic(s)\" pops up like 10 or 15 times.  WHY couldn't they have replaced that word with \"artifact(s)\"?  I was so annoyed by that that I had to write to Patrick Stewart myself and also send a comment about it to Hideo Kojima Productions.  The only time I felt that Patrick really hit his stride was during the very last chapter of the game.  Only then did I hear any REAL performance from him.So there you have it.  Should you buy it or rent it?  Buy it!  The game has plenty of replay value since you have to complete all the trials if you want to collect some silver trophies.  You will also have to replay some of the levels if you want to find any weapons upgrades.  All in all, the game is great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"ice grizzly \"Grrrrrr\"","summary":"Nintendo innovates again","reviewText":"There are lot of negative reviews because, nintendo doesnt want to follow the traditional model. They did it with DS, Wii, 3DS and now with WiiU. They provide a unique and different experience. There is no need for nintendo to do another live service or a crazy multi-core CPU like Sony. They were the ones who introduced Dual Screen gaming with DS, D-PAD, Rumble Controller, Motion Gaming and all the new concepts to the gaming world. Take a few minutes break and understand what WiiU is trying to do. Almost every one today own more than one console, and if all of them do the same.. there is no need to own the secondary console.I love the dual screen gaming of WiiU. New Super Mario U and Nintendo Land are great examples. Microsoft and Sony are more suitable for solitary gaming and playing online. Neither move or kinect can handle 4 people at the same time in the room as Wii did. WiiU takes it a notch higher, with one person setting platforms or creating ghosts for others to chase is lot lot more fun. This is a party gaming machine. Don't compare a microwave oven with a toaster oven.Spend the extra bucks and get the deluxe version. Else you will have to purchase a external HDD for game downloads. And Nintendo does a great job publishing games on the first year. In the next 12 months there will be tonnes of games that will bring cheers to the family like no other machine. WiiU will always be relavant because it is unique. It is not trying to be a PC replica. Most of the other console makers are simply trying to be a PC.. given that PCs are so cheap now I would rather have a PC hooked up to the TV for my ultra high resolution gaming and WiiU for party games.10 years from now, almost all the controllers will have a touch screen and it will be the defacto for gaming standards as like D-PAD and rumble.

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"A great Pokemon game like the others, but not the greatest","reviewText":"A great Pokemon game, but the newer Pokemon are kind of lame, some features have been taken out that existed in the past game (like the phone option and rematches in G/S/C/HG/SS), and the in-game backpack is horribly cluttered, reminding you of Gen I more than anything else. (WHY did they have to un-seperate Poke Balls from general items? I prefer HeartGold and SoulSilver's \"too organized\" backpack over this cluttered and confusing one.)Also, C-Gear, the Nintendo DS's wireless communication system for the game, is extremely annoying and everytime you turn on the game, it'll prompt you numerous times if you want to turn on C-Gear and use it (which also quickly drains the DS' power and you'll rarely ever use C-Gear).Pros:- Unova, Pokemon's version of the New York City area, is fun to explore. Its possibly the best region and may even be better than Johto.- Pokemon learn moves at a much faster rate, even after evolving. For Smart Trainers, this means holding off evolution for a shorter time.- The gym leaders are more detailed and likable than in the past, and their gyms are (mostly) challenging-but-fair.- For the first time, TM's now have infinite uses, which adds a HUGE element of challenge for competitive battling (Egg Moves are however, still just as hard to obtain).- Variety of new Pokemon per area and the new dual-type combinations (like Ghost/Fire or Grass/Steel) are pretty cool.- The art and graphics are great and really use the power of the 96-bit Nintendo DS.- The Trainer Card is good and you can now customize your own personality and Trainer Class.- The shops (now merged with Pokemon Centers) usually have most items you'll need.Cons:- Most of the new Pokemon kind of suck. So far, only the starters and a few (like Herdier, Tranquill, and Throh) have been good. Hate to admit it, but Generation I and Generation III still have the best overall Pokemon.- Disorganized and hard-to-access backpack. Not enough separate pockets!- Wild Pokemon level-curve is steep. Often times, wild Pokemon will jump 4 to 5 levels in ranges inbetween one route and another. Such as being as high as level 25 in one route, but then jumping up to 32 in the next route.- The new interiors of the Pokemon Centers are tight, condensed, claustrophobic, and just plain UGLY.- The Battle Subway is LAME and is not a great Battle Frontier replacement.- No Pokemon application gadget to have rematch against NPC trainers with (like Pokegear, the PokeNav, or Poketch).- The Xtransceiver (in-game smartphone) is under-utilized and would've been a nice equivalent of PokeGear or a PokeNav.- C-Gear is ANNOYING!!! It does not replace the previous-gen Pokemon app devices at all. It is just a pain to use (or rather, select to not use).- The Dream World is hard to access and overall, not worth it. Dream World is stupid.- Too many pointless and stupid social networking items and apps that you'll likely never use.Overall, the game is fun, but it doesn't feel like that new of an adventure. If you've played one Pokemon game, you've played them all. I now miss the Kanto Pokemon I've raised a thousand times before... What I wouldn't give for a Farfetch'd or Eevee or Smoochum in this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2014"}

Included on the disc are over 5,000 questions ranging from music, to movies, sports, and more.  Put your knowledge to the test as you play with up to 8 friends - buzzing your way to game show stardom!","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A great party game with some caveats","reviewText":"Whenever I have friends over for  a party, invariably we end up playing some type of trivia game, usually while imbibing our drink of choice.  In fact, it's become a tradition at parties to break out a console and get our trivia game face on.  I love trivia questions, as do my friends.  Usually, we've gravitated to the Scene It? series on the Xbox 360, but that changed when I received Buzz! Quiz TV.On the surface, Quiz TV is basically your typical game show brought to virtual life.  There's nothing super exciting about it.  You just answer questions.  Sometimes questions are asked after looking at various pictures; sometimes it's a movie clip; sometimes it's an audio clip.  But it's always the same thing: a question is asked and you want to be the quickest to answer.  The categories are very wide-ranging, from the biggest blockbusters to different periods of music (90s, 80s, modern, oldies, etc.) to scientific questions to geographical questions...Buzz! Quiz TV has it all.  And with 5,000 questions out of the box and more available online, there's a ton of replayability inherent in the game.What makes Quiz TV unique and more entertaining than other similar games (Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action, I'm looking at you) is the wink and nudge, smarmy humor encapsulated in the host.  Buzz, the host, has that voice that can only be described as smarmy and says provocative things.  But it's all done with a wink and a laugh, a send up and parody of some of the really bad game shows hosts out there.  Additionally, while you can't create your own character, the selection of available avatars is terrific and, again, full of character.  Whether you're playing as a mime who strikes poses, the cheesy and egotistical super hero, or the 80s-style mall rocker, there's a lot of humor to be had.  Very expressive and, more interestingly, the host will respond based on the character you've selected.  So, playing as the super hero you will hear different remarks than if you were playing the has been 80s mall chick.Additional features add to the value.  For instance, if you have enough controllers, you can play with up to 8 people.  Or if you can't even find another person to play with, you can take the questions online.  Also, as seems to be the thing to do these days, there's a community section where you can craft your own trivia questions and spread them to the world or play other people's trivia questions.It would have been nice if you could play online and in the same room at the same time; that is, take your \"team\" of local players and compete against others online.  But, unfortunately, the online portion seems to be just one player.  This is a downside for me because games like these are more of a social activity and playing online, while still technically social, isn't as fun as having a group of people with you.Other small issues abound, though.  One thing to note is that the game doesn't come with batteries, so you'll need eight AA batteries to play it.  But the biggest problem for me is the lack of variety.  Sure there's variety in the groups of questions and the types of questions being asked, but the game types are set in stone.  For instance, you'll always begin a game with \"the point builder\" where you simply want to get an answer before the time runs out.  The second round will, again, always be the same and has you playing hot potato with a bomb where quick and correct guesses will get the bomb out of your hands.  The third round will always be the same, etc. all the way to the end.  It's not that the game types included aren't fun because they are (and have brought out tons of laughter amongst my gaming group), it's that there's not enough variety or randomness.One of the features I've enjoyed with Scene It? is that the game types are completely random and so it doesn't feel like you're playing the exact same game over and over.  I wish there were more game types and it was random, but I understand that the way it's created mimics typical game shows.Overall, though, Buzz! moves into the Playstation 3 world with a great solid entry.  I love the character of the game, whether it's the host or the individual contestants.  The questions verge on being a little too easy, but there's so many categories and fun questions that cover a wide section of our world that it's forgivable.  By far the best part is the post-release support.  Already there's at least one question pack, a Horror Movie Question Pack just in time for Halloween that included an additional 500 questions.  That kind of support will help give Buzz! Quiz TV longevity.  I just wish that there was more variety in the game types and rounds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}

Since most of you reading this will be little kiddies and stay-at-home moms, I'll relate my pros and cons in easy-to-read list form so as to not tax your tiny little brains:Pros:-If you're old, this device will make you look young. As in, \"Hey look at the guy playing with the baby toy!\"- There are no more Pros. This device is awfulCons:- Horrible graphics. Remember how good the PSP looked 5 years ago? This looks almost as good as that...5 years later.- Ineptly designed online component that ties all your purchases and friends to a piece of hardware instead of to the user that bought the content or created the friends. Yes, in Nintendo's world it will forever be 1995.- If you go outside and grab some dog poop, smear it all over your DS screens, and then play a DS game, that's how good DS games look when played on the 3DS.- A Friends list that's completely useless. Hey cool I can see my friend are logged in. I'll send them a message. Nope, cant do that. I'll send them this incredibly low-rez picture I just took with one of the 3DS's cameras that came from 1999. Nope, can't do that either.- The sweetspot (aka the viewing distance and angle in which to see 3D properly) is about the size of a postage stamp. Move your head a little or the device and bye bye 3D.- The 3D will make elderly women poop their pants. I let my grandmother view it and her poor little diaper was full almost immediately. It could have been caused by the Taco Bell lunch I made her eat instead of the doctor recommended diet meal she requested, but I doubt it.- 250 dollars for technology that Nintendo quite literally stole off of cellphones from the late 90s and early 2000s?

This headset from Sony made for the PS3 sidesteps this issue by having a 3.5mm input and cable that is removable if you don't want if while in wireless use with your console. With the supplied 3.5mm cable you can connect virtually anything to these phones and get great sound, I hooked these up to a KAOSS pad and they have incredible depth of sound on all ranges of the EQ. None of the features that really make this set great when in use with a computer or console work in power off mode but the 3.5 feature is really a great inclusion.  Next big plus, they are comfy and the design of the ear cups makes room for even big ears.  Once you hook these up to your PS3 you start to get familiar with the buttons, and volume controls all of which are placed well and function nicely.  Mic mute, Mode setting, Master Vol, Voice/Sound Vol, VSS(virtual surround), and another amazing feature the BASSIMPACT slider.  When set to high or mid you will get force feedback type vibration around the ears, be careful when using this feature with music or music games as the Bass can overwhelming with certain genres.  The set charges easily with a non included USB cable and as I said before can be used with any sound source other than the PS3/PC without powering up.  I usually like to play games through speakers but I really enjoyed RB3 using these and was even able to use the MIC for vocals.  There was some delay and MIC naturally wants to turn everything it hears into audible CHAT which is good since that's what this mic was built to do. It appears to be very sensitive to the area in front of it, and the manual says to not point the MIC at the R speaker if using external sound otherwise useful and well implemented.  The USB stick has a 3.5 input to put your TV sound through which seems strange but will allow some users to listen to TV wireless.  Great addition to your PS3 if you like good spatial surround sound and voice chat,  The 3.5mm cord that is included is very short as it is designed for use with portables like the VITA, so you might want to get a longer one for using these to DJ etc.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

This time you'll travel around the entire globe to stop the tyranny of the deadly Greater Fiends, with an array of neat weapons, moves and combos. Design-wise the game is near flawless, Tecmo make use of stunning graphics to portray the story, and the music is fantastic in its own right. The story is simple enough to follow along with; monsters take over the planet, and you're out to save it. The only drawback is that the game is completely straightly linear, if you mind that kind of thing, and also that even the easiest difficulty setting is taxing and very challenging. I can tell you without hesitation that any higher tier of difficulty is completely out of the question for me. Unconquerable? Perhaps not. Absolutely extremely absurdly difficult? I'm sure of it. The boss battles in particular are known to be very annoying; every boss has a different weakness, and you're never clued in as to what it is. Blocking a certain attack, using a certain weapon, timing a jump, you never know what's expected of you, and even when you do, you're sure to be just a little bit too short of health to win, time after time. If you have the patience of a ninja, and can take in a viciously gory yet beautiful game, check it out.

And the only way to succeed is to solve the Secret of Mana.","reviewerName":"Sam Allen \"A zealous individual\"","summary":"One of the ultimate \"cult\" titles for the Super Nintendo","reviewText":"Released in 1993, Square's Secret of Mana is a game in their line of SNES releases that was perhaps a bit overshadowed by Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The game has a graphical engine that would be expanded upon in Chrono Trigger, but the game's real-time battle physics make it more directly comparable to something like Nintendo's own Zelda: A Link to the Past.However, there are a number of aspects that set this game apart from all of those mentioned. It all starts with the characters and the way in which they are controlled. There are three characters: a boy, a girl, and a sprite. With the relatively obscure Super Multitap adapter, up to three players were able to take the journey together. In one-player or two-player controlled adventures, you can switch which character(s) you control with the simple push of the select button; those you are not controlling will be thus taken over by AI. This creates a separation from those other games: rather than have one player control a full party at once, or just have one character, more freedom of choice is given to the player about who they want to control. Sometimes the AI can be a bit sloppy when it comes to moving from place to place, but that rarely becomes much of an issue as you can just switch character control and get them to where you want to be.In this game, the weapon system is quite vastly different than that of FF or CT, and different still from Zelda. There are 8 main weapons in the game (Sword, Axe, Spear, Whip, Glove, Javelin, Boomerang and Bow), and they are powered up as many as 8 times each by collecting orbs and having them forged with the help of a blacksmith. Granted, many of these weapons are the sort of thing you'd typically expect to find in an RPG, but the ability to level them up as high as this and to need more than just money to do it adds a bit of depth to this system. On the other hand, the equipment system is pretty standard fare; armor, headgear, and armgear can all be purchased in item shops.The battle system is also a unique feature for the game. It is in real-time (like Zelda), and you can also charge your weapons as they level up (like Zelda), but the difference is that you can charge them up higher and higher for more and more powerful attacks - and your weapons level up with experience points. Also, rather than hack blindly at enemies, you have to wait til you are at full power to deliver a decent blow to an enemy. Sometimes, they can evade attacks, which can get a little frustrating. But that's what you have magic for. Your magic abilities (based on the elements of Water, Earth, Air/Lightning, Fire, Dark, Light, Lunar and Nature) can be leveled up and deliver on enemies when physical attacks seem to be getting you nowhere fast. Perhaps that's a fairly common thing, but here, levelling up magic is done by using it - and it works in your favor.There are other positives too:+Good if not fantastic musical score+Additional characters in the story that add a bit of depth to each player+Respectable challenge+Tight controls+Dungeons don't drag on forever... mostlyThe few negatives:-Some slowdown and glitching in situations with lots of enemies on screen at once-Sometimes the story doesn't make much sense-The occasional overly-long dungeonBut all in all, this game is highly recommended as it is a lost treasure of the SNES. It's a good purchase but it does run a little steep, so Wii users should consider downloading it to their virtual console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}

It's the kind of game you can play for hours and literally lose track of time! It took me two months to finish it, and I still wanted more.I have no clue as to why some people are referring to this game as Infamous 1.5. They have either only played the demo, or haven't played it at all. This is honestly the first time I've played the second installment of any game because I've always feared that there would be nothing new. Infamous 2 put many of those fears to rest because this game has tons of new additions! There are new weapons, new powers, new enemies, smarter enemies, new surroundings, new karma options, user generated content, etc. I mean come on, I would sometimes spend 20 minutes watching my tornado rip through the city, what game offers that? The hand to hand combat has been greatly improved and you can even finish villains off with special attacks. Also, this game is much harder than it's predecessor. I died several times trying to kill some of the basic henchmen. Even though I died a lot while doing certain missions, I never found it to be frustrating, only challenging. Some of the boss battles were extremely fun because some of them were HUGE and I had to use strategy to beat them.No game is completely perfect, so here's a couple of things I didn't like. I completed every side mission in the game, but many of them repeated themselves. There's probably something like 60 side-missions so it would be hard to have them all be unique. It was not a huge problem because you don't have to do them if you don't want to, I like having a choice. I do think the user generated content (UGC) was a great idea. But, many of the missions blew and were not any fun. I tried to make one but I didn't finish because it seemed like a lot of work. The only other issue I had was that once you defeat a boss, you will see that boss again on at least 4 more occasions (usually on side missions). Once I'm done with a boss, I honestly don't want to see him again. None of these negatives were enough to subtract a star because I could have avoided all of this if I wanted to. If I were forced to do all of the side missions and participate in UGC, then I would deduct stars because like I said earlier, I like having a choice :)If you liked the first Infamous, you will love this one. Don't listen to some of these reviewers, there's a ton of new stuff to keep you interested without reminding you of part one. Even if you have not played the first game, I still think you should give this a try because it will be like nothing you've ever played before. Most games are not worth their $59.99 price-tag. This one sure is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2011"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"even sandbox-haters will love it","reviewText":"I was ready to hate Fallout 3.I'm not a fan of sandbox games. As an adult gamer with a toddler and a day job, I have a limited amount of time on my hands. I played Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for a few days before I threw it down in disgust, aggravated by the lack of plot direction, frustrated by all the constraints placed on me by polite society (don't even think about stealing a wooden plate!), and bored by the long walks it took for my character to get anywhere. Yes, Elder Scrolls is a hugely immersive game, but I don't have time to be that immersive.Fallout 3 starts with you being born. It's at that point you determine your gender and, as a toddler, you learn about your SPECIAL (an acronym for your character's attributes) abilities. How many games let you walk around a playpen as a toddler while teaching you the fundamentals of the game at the same time?You continue as a pre-teen, dealing with all the difficulties of life in the Vault, a fallout shelter to protect you from the nuclear war raging outside.  As the outside world intrudes, it becomes clear that all is not as it seems.  Your scientist father disappears and it's up to you to leave the safety of the Vault and find dear old dad.Nuclear war struck in the 1950s, locking the outside world in retro-future state.  Ray guns, Robby-the-Robot style automatons, and cars with fins dominate the landscape.  But it is a broken, shattered landscape littered with the detritus of humanity's failed hopes and dreams. And it is here where you will find everything from post-apocalyptic preachers, cannibalistic ghouls, super-mutants, and a whole pile of Mad Max-style survivalists.There are still the annoying holdovers from Elder Scrolls - you can't just take things without consequences.  And you do get tired from all that walking, of which there's a lot of walking to do.  But for some reason, this is all less aggravating than Elder Scrolls.Part of it has to do with the sheer depth of the game.  Fallout's blend of post-apocalyptic with retro-future creates a unique setting that makes you want to explore the game. From your grainy PIPBoy 2000 to the Mohawks of the wasteland raiders, to the cheery 1950s-style manuals and billboards, Fallout 3 is an immersive experience.Like BioShock, there are multiple means of overcoming a challenge.  You can be stealthy.  You can reprogram robots to do your work for you.  You can be a charmer, smooth-talking your way out of difficult quests.  Or you can just bash stuff over the head with a baseball bat.Unlike all the promises made in Mass Effect, Fallout 3 actually delivers.  The pausing system for combat actually makes sense (it's called VATS), and yet you can still shoot an enemy's head off from a distance without using VATS. The world is large enough to make getting lost at night a terrifying prospect, but not so imposing that you can't make it to a safe place to rest. And there are plenty of quests to keep you busy.I'm still not a fan of sandbox games. But Fallout 3's so good, I'll make an exception.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2009"}

While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the DC.  There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease. A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become.  Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line. The local video stores around me have dropped Dc. Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale. The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games.  Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind.  Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry. The current price is very very good. But it is consol taking it's last breaths.  Was the PSX2 heaps better. I don't think so. Not from what I saw.

Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"thePersian{Knife","summary":"the Action/Platforming sections are Hit Or Miss.","reviewText":"I did some homework on Resistance 2 before purchasing, and was somewhat suprisedby the outdoor environments in the game.  I was expecting more clarity.Some levels seem grainy.  The indoor facilities look much better, possibly because they're darker.There is an emphasis on platforming in order to progress, which is rare in a FPS.Frustration may settle in when you're looking for clues of where to go next.The difficulty level of the game is relatively high.  If you're looking for a challenge,Resistance 2 is a good choice.  If you want to be rewarded for each triumph, you may be left highand dry; it is a rugged war after all.  The gunplay's good, and there's a great variety of pieces to wield.Although you kill thousands of Chimera in the campaign, the sizes, abilities and strategies of the enemykeep things fresh.  The multiplayer's fun, but can be pretty nuts.  It may depend on how good you get, but the gameplaycan seem insubstantial at times.  In coop missions, you and your team plow through ant armies and king beesenroute to the objective.  I need to warn you about the flying, shielded drones in the campaign.They made me quit the game, because I couldn't figure out how to shoot them down.Resistance 2 is a classic, but ultimately a stone cold bummer for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

The missions themselves provide variety by mixing up objectives including destroy everything in sight, stealth recon sans weapons, escort, and a follow-the-leader test of your maneuvering skill.My biggest frustration came in the form of a mission consisting of a boring afterburner flight to a cutscene, followed by more boring afterburner to the objective. The objective was a foe who could take a serious beating while doling out plenty of punishment. A tight time limit pushed me over the edge. I don't mind a good challenge, but don't force me to endure several minutes of uneventful button mashing for every attempt.

Son","summary":"A LEGION of Improvements:: NO SPOILERS","reviewText":"Mass Effect 2 improves on its predecessor in almost every way. The combat is more polished and exciting. They have done away with the infinite ammo/overheat method of combat and opted for the traditional ammo count via thermal clips so now it works like a regular shooter. You also have quite a selection of some really neat heavy weapons that create massive damage to enemies. Biotic and Tech skills are vastly improved visually and their variety is much greater than that of ME1. The graphics are better and the environments are far more varied and interesting. The days of rolling over terrain after terrain with the Mako are now replaced with probes that find the area and drop you in right where the action is. The story hasn't slacked either. The story will captivate you just as much as Mass Effect 1 and the characters are very interesting and well written. Some will not enjoy the characters as much as this one although some of the old crew returns. Most of your crew has a lot more gray area as opposed to Mass Effect 1 where all of your characters were typically Good/Bad (Mostly Good). I particularly enjoyed this as it led to some interesting moments. Not all of your team will be on the same page and you will definitely be squashing some heated arguments between members that don't get along. This made the experience more realistic to me. The meat and potatoes of this game though, is the choices you make and the consequences they have. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, including Shepard can die in this game depending on what you do. You also have a lot more choices about who you'd like to pursue a romantic relationship with as well.I loaded my save from ME1 and I can vouch that almost every decision I made somehow showed up in the game. Of course the bigger decisions I had made played a more vital roll in the storyline and gameplay but I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole slew of smaller decisions I'd made show up throughout the game. This was amazing for me, however, this is a double edged sword. If you take nothing else from this review take this: IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED MASS EFFECT 1, PLAY IT FIRST. I can't personally vouch for the experience of someone who plays this without playing the first but if it doesn't bother filling in the new players about a lot of past events I would seriously think they'll be very lost. Not only that, but it won't be near as cool playing it if you can't see how the decisions you made from ME1 change everything in ME2. ME2 wasn't perfect. There were a handful of times I got stuck on a rock or table and had no way of getting off so I'd have to reload the autosave. Scanning planets and launching probes can be a monotonous and daunting task. These are small gripes to an otherwise, excellent game. Mass Effect 1 thoroughly impressed me. Mass Effect 2 blew my socks off.PROS:Improved GraphicsRevamped and Improved CombatImproved Teamate AICaptivating StorySolid Character DevelopmentBeautiful and Diverse EnvironmentsExtremely High Replay ValueCONS:Newcomers might be lost about story aspects from the gameA few glitches will probably happen throughout the course of the gameScanning planets get redundant","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2010"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Massively, Effectively Dissapointing","reviewText":"Let's get this out of the way first - I am one of the biggest Mass Effect fans in the Milky Way.  I reserved this game in two different places just to get as much extra DLC as I could (more on that travesty later.)  I have the Collectors Edition of both games, both novels, and 2 of the four Comic Books - the second volume just hit shelves today.  I know the story like the back of my hand.Maybe that's why Mass Effect 2 is such a major disappointment.  BioWare allegedly spent a lot of time researching feedback from the first game, and \"vastly improved\" upon various aspects from Mass Effect 1.  What they in-fact did was create an abstract, disjointed and frustrating combat experience, added in a slew of loading screens were there was once flow and connection between areas and missions, and used a revolutionary dialogue system on a lame excuse for a sci-fi adventure of galactic proportions.I'm going to hit on the most important part first - combat.  There has been so much discussion on the \"excellent\" and \"much-improved\" combat system.  I don't know what these people are playing, but this combat system is laughable.  For starters, we've lost the ability to crouch.  You can no longer duck behind boxes and walls - unless you engage the cover system.  In ME1, you simply pressed your character into a wall or crate and you would automatically take cover.  Now you have to hit the 'A' button.  This would work OK if the 'A' button didn't also control running.  So imagine this scenario: you enter a large area where you're ambushed by enemies.  You see a low wall to the side, so you run and take cover.  You manage to pick off a few bad guys before catching sight of a few more baddies attempting to flank you.  You turn to the side while switching guns, when suddenly your character stands up!  You didn't want to stand up, but since you can't actively crouch, you stand up the moment you break cover.  So now you're not only vulnerable to the enemies who have flanked you, but all the remaining enemies around you.  This happens often, and kills you almost just as frequently.To add to the frustration, you now have to manage ammo.  Ammo is thoroughly covered in the first game, and also the Mass Effect novels.  It doesn't exist in this timeframe.  But because people whined about the combat system from ME1, they decided to give us \"heat sinks\" that have to be ejected from the guns - effectively acting as ammo.  BioWare tells us that ammo is abundant, but it's anything but true.  Often you'll kill entire groups of opponents only to find 2 or 3 ammo packs - not nearly enough to refill your stash.  Furthermore many of your guns have extremely limited ammo quantities, such as the Sniper Rifle which only holds 10 shots.  When playing as an Infiltrator, this could be very difficult to work with.  Quite frankly, I don't know why they did it.  It's no fun, and it can become incredibly frustrating to suddenly run out of ammo mid-fight.Next up, the missions...  I want to find out who convinced BioWare to get rid of my precious Mako.  Everyone complains about the Mako - that thing was awesome!  Certainly no more challenging to drive than a Warthog in Halo.  With a little practice, it could dodge enemy fire in combat, and came with some pretty heavy artillery.  People complain about how hard it was to get over some of the mountains on various planets.  Did you ever try checking the map?  The map would show you areas of transition between the elevations - showing you the clear and easy path to get to where you were going.  The straight path from A to B wasn't always the quickest.  So now we sit through uninspiring loading screens - some of which are quite long - and feel much less connected to the story.  We also don't get to traverse loading docks anymore - exiting (and later reentering) the air lock of the new Normandy.  What all this does is disconnect you from the story.  Mass Effect 1 had a tremendous flow to it: select your destination, walk to the airlock, pick your crew, and exit the ship onto your mission.  By the way, maps are all-but gone in ME2 as well - you get overly detailed maps while loitering in the various cities/space stations, but all you get during missions to help you find your way is a glitchy \"go this way\" objective arrow in the corner of the screen.And the story...  I've compared the first 40 hours of gameplay to an oversized grocery shopping list.  \"Go get this guy.  Okay, now get this guy.  Get this guy too.  Okay now make this guy like you better.  Okay, no this guy too...\"  You spend a massive amount of time recruiting people for your team, then fulfill completely pointless missions to make them \"loyal\" - stories like, \"Oh help me find my sister\" or \"My daddy called me!\"  It's pandering, and pretty pathetic.  The end warms up, but it tends to feel like too little too late.  Are we saving the Galaxy here or playing some pickup B-ball...?On top of all this is a relatively glitchy game.  My character has gotten stuck a number of times already - even in some of the DLC missions.  Clipping seems to be a frequent issue - in fact, the entire time you run around you'll see the guns on Shephard's back clipping with each other - the gun holsters from the previous game have not been resized to fit the new \"heavy weapons\" which have been crammed in the middle, so you end up looking like you're carrying around some kind of jetpack - you can't tell where one gun ends and the next begins.  Does it affect gameplay?  Not at all - but it's pretty pathetic for a game that BioWare has bragged as being \"their best game ever.\"  Some dialogue conversations don't flow properly, and sometimes just don't make sense.  If you put your guns away in the middle of a fight, your teammates will shout out \"All enemies clear!\" even while you're still being shot at!The game certainly isn't without merit.  The new hack/bypass mini-games are a welcome change from the \"Bop-It\" button press challenges of the previous games.  The diversity in weapons within a certain class (such as the Standard verses the Viper Sniper Rifles) is nice, even if you don't get to collect dozens of weapons as you did in the first game.  The new Normandy is cool, though wandering around to carry on conversations with your oversized crew gets old kinda quick.  One good aspect of combat is the quick ability to change ammo types quickly.  I do still wish they'd use a hotkey system more similar to Fallout or Oblivion, but I recognize the challenge of incorporating crew commands as well.  The dialogue has been ramped up even further - the new \"interrupt\" system added to conversations is just awesome - ESPECIALLY the Renegade moments.  I'm following a Paragon path, but will often follow the Renegade interrupts and then reload to the last save point - they're worth watching THAT much.  There is plenty of Nostalgia as well, both in the form of reappearing crew members from the first game (though I agree that some of these moments are underwhelming.)  Still, they pull it off in a manner that waits until the last moment to surprise you.  It's a nice touch.  For those buying the game new, you can also visit the Normandy crash site.  It's definitely an emotional scene - especially if you felt connected to the story and characters (of which the Normandy and Mako became their own characters) from the first game.But it's hard to decide if these pros make up for the drastic oversights.  The combat options have been stripped down, there's this MIND-numbingly boring planet-scan mini-game to gather resources...  Not sure what they were thinking there.  I was falling asleep scanning planets today...I love Mass Effect - I love the story.  This is the next Star Trek taking shape and it's a phenomenal opportunity to reintroduce the current generation to good quality sci-fi.  But if companies like BioWare keep pandering to the straight and narrow (minded) first-person shooter games, then it'll never truly take hold.  Mass Effect can be so much better than this, and it's frustrating to see such a great game in Mass Effect 1 get reduced to this because they listened to too many cry-babies.  ME2 fixes things that didn't need fixed, overshadowing the handful of improvements overall.If you're a die-hard fan well, you've probably bought it already, making this a moot point.  The overall census seems to agree that if you REALLY enjoyed the first game, you'll be disappointed - even heartbroken - by this one.  If you thought the first was too frustrating/challenging/boring, then this one has been effectively dumbed down for you.  Personally I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed for Mass Effect 3, and look forward to the third and final novel arriving in July.P.S.  And because I forgot to mention it, allow me to say briefly that the new \"Cerberus Network\" from EA is a total scam.  They have taken a simple, streamlined process of downloading extra content for video games and made it the singularly most frustrating experience ever.  It took me over 3 hours to remedy the situation - eventually having to sit online for an hour waiting for chat-based tech support.  It is maddening, and an insult to serious gamers the world over.  EA needs to accept their position as a valid member of the gaming industry - not as a self-proclaimed leader.  Get over yourselves.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2010"}

About the only thing I thought was a little corny was the final boss, including the explanation as to why the final boss looks the way it does. Your actions in ME2 also greatly change more of the story compared to playing ME1.* Combat - Combat is much improved. Almost as good (but not quite) as Rainbow 6: LV. Things like cover are actually useful now.* Graphics - All of the problems regarding textures should now be fixed.* ME1 Import - Your past decisions in ME1 affect the storyline. I can't think of any other video game that has done this in recent history. It's a great feature.* Characters - Some old and some new. All of them are great in adding to the story.* Lots of other misc fixes - like no more crappy rover mining, better loading times, etc...[Cons]* ME1 Import - While this feature is rare in video games and it's a good start,  without giving spoilers, your past decisions don't really affect the ME2 world and storyline very much. Almost all of it is shallow, including big decisions like what you did with the Council in ME1. Almost all of the results of your past decisions in ME1 will only come to you via email. Much better than nothing, but it feels very unpolished and lacking. I wish the decisions in ME1 (at least the really big ones) did something, say enough to want to play ME1 again. This is currently just not the case.* Characters - Compared to past Bioware games Baldur's Gate II, KOTOR I, and ME1, your team is a lot less chatty. They rarely engage in random conversation anymore, which makes them feel a lot less life like.* RPG -instead of fixing inventory, they just completely took it out.[Summary]They improved many things and made a few things worse.

You will find yourself clearing the same dungeon four or five times and doing quests that you will have a tough time remembering if you did them before because it is almost the same thing.  Also, many of the quests will not work due to a massive number of bugs.The combat has some visually appeasing finishing moves, but they are offset by the fact that you can't block and have a spell armed at the same time.  There is a perk tree that will allow you pick a perk when you level up, but they don't flow well, which will force you to pick worthless perks to get to ones you could actually use.  They also changed the way enemies level from Oblivion where the enemy leveled along with you.  In this you will go through a three-level dungeon only to have a boss kill you with one shot.I also didn't care for the maps.  There is a world map that has clouds, so that you can't see half of things and a local map that is a blotchy, grainy mess.Overall, this game just felt like it needed someone to edit out half of the monotonous quests and locations.

It took a while to get used to, but once I did I found it to be immensely satisfying to play with. In Killzone 3, it straight up kicks ass. Wether firing from the hip or using the in-game ironsights, I felt like this thing gave me a great edge. Finally, I can micro-aim on a console! I'm not quite ready to say this thing is as good as a mouse and keyboard, but I can say that it definitely works better than my old XIM that I built a year or two back, and is a lot more convenient to set up and use.This thing ups both the fun factor and the precision when I'm playing, and while I can play just fine sitting on the couch, it's a lot of fun to play standing up in the middle of the room. In addition to being a more physical way to play, I found that it gave me more control since I could use my torso in addition to my arms to adjust my view. It really sucked me into the game-- shooting was more satisfying because I felt like I was actually aiming, and melee combat was more responsive and visceral due to the gesture-based command for it-- there's no need to fumble with buttons when the Helghast jump you, because you can just let your reflexes take over and jolt your gun at the enemy like you're thrusting a bayonet on a rifle.When this thing was $40 I'd have said it was a bit on the expensive side, but for only $20 it's worth every penny-- especially if you're getting it in one of the bundles that comes with the the Move starter kit and a game. This thing turns the best motion controller on the market into the best lightgun on the market. If you're going to play a lot of shooters using your Move controller, this thing is a must-have.

The kids have played different versions from Gamecube, Xbox 360 and DSs.  This Spyro doesn't look like the other Spyro games we had before.  I think it has a potential to be big such as some of the Pok&eacute;mon video games.  It is addictive and has a lot of repeat playability.You have to admit it, this is a very well thought out game with brilliant marketing.  It doesn't ends up with the starter pack.  You don't have to buy more action figures to complete the game but somehow you will really want to expand your collection as it adds a lot of fun in the game.  The action figure seems to have a life of its own.  They are wireless, you just have to put it on top of the portal base (which is included with the started pack), then it saves its level status complete with the upgrades.  You can then bring it to a friend's house with a Skylander game and continue playing no matter what the console is, Xbox, Wii or PS3.When you start, you have to setup the Portal of Power first - batteries included.  You need to connect a USB dongle which you will find inside the Portal battery compartment.  Plug it to the USB outlet at the back of the Wii.It seems to be just an ordinary game at first.  The graphics are not that spectacular, it is just like a normal cartoon video game.  As you progress and starts leveling up your characters, the game becomes more fun and addictive.  If you die, it tells you to rest that character and put another one of your action figures.  They don't revive until you restart a level so it helps a lot to have more action figures as they start with a full life.Each Skylander is one of the eight types:  Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Life, Undead, Magic, and Tech.  You start with Spyro, Trigger Happy and Gill Grunt.  You can rename them if you want.The rest of them are as follows:Fire -  Ignitor,  Sunburn,  Flameslinger,  EruptorWater - Slam-Bam,  Zap,  Wham-Shell,  Gill GruntMagic -  Spyro the Dragon,  Double Trouble,  Wrecking Ball,  Voodood,  Dark Spyro,  Legendary SpyroMech -  Boomer,  Drill Sergeant,  Drobot,  Trigger Happy,  Legendary Trigger HappyAir -  Sonic Boom,  Whirlwind,  Lightning Rod,  WarnadoUndead -  Hex,  Cynder,  Chop Chop,  Ghost Roaster,  Legendary Chop ChopEarth -  Bash,  Dino-Rang,  Prism Break,  Terrafin,  Legendary BashLife -  Camo,  Stump Smash,  Zook,  Stealth Elf","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

As you may have guessed, I love this game. It took me about a year to finish it though... Huh? I know this is weird. Here is what happened.I bought this game used about 2 weeks after it came out. I got to the part where you are attacked by the indestructible creature in the room where you basically have to just survive for about a minute without getting killed by enemies spawning from every corner of the room. I was so terrified that I thought my heart was going to explode out of my chest. I returned the game to Gamestop and got Far Cry 2 instead which I proceeded to spend the next 40 hours or so playing and loving.Everytime I went to Gamestop, I would look at Dead Space and be tempted to pick it up again. Finally, about 9 months later, the game was selling for $20 and I picked it up again. I was hooked. I played the game all the way through and when I beat the last boss, I started the game again and there is a new Game + feature where you get to keep all your weapons and attributes from the last game. This is an awesome game that did not get the sales it deserves. It will be getting a sequel though which is awesome.Graphics: The graphics on this game are simply very impressive. One of the reasons why I was not interested in this game when the previews first started appearing was the fact that it appeared to just be a corridor shooter. Didn't look very interesting really. Good reviews started coming out and this led to my initial purchase of the game. It really looks amazing. You really feel like you are on a ship all alone fighting legion of unstoppable demons. Character models are amazing. Isaac's movements, reload animations and finishing moves are totally kick ass.Gameplay: This is the perfect horror shooter game. Better than RE5 as you get to shoot and run--one of the dumbest holdouts for RE5 BTW. That being said, this game is pretty much a copy of the all of the elements of RE4. Yes I did not make a mistake. This game is closer to RE4 that RE5 as this game has no coop element, and RE5 threw out the merchant element. In Dead Space, You have the merchant(the store),  you get items from crates, you have an inventory function where you have to conserve space for weapons, ammo and health, there are a variety of cool guns--all of which can be upgrades with increased capacity, firepower, etc.Overall: Get this game. I recommend playing this game on Easy the first time through as it does get pretty hairy having creatures attack from all sides and no way to pause to check inventory. BTW, that brings up pretty much the only negative. The New Game + feature only allows you to play the same difficult level. Why not let you try playing on hard with the best armor and guns??","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

The most important issue for me was incorporating playing against bots. I spent most of my time with Black Ops in what used to be called Combat Training, now combat training is called something else. If you aren't too good at first person shooters, you can join the league play in which you can play with similarly skilled players as yourself with all perks and attachments available(\"pick 10\" of them). I personally think this idea is genius, because it's not fun getting killed over and over by overmatched players.If you buy this game today, you'll receive the Nuketown 2025 map which you can play against bots. I enjoyed the DLC maps the best with Black Ops 1, so I'm expecting great maps as well with future DLC with Black Ops 2. If I were to buy BO2 strategically, I would wait until the price drops, but really there is nothing recent that has come out.  I do believe the DLC maps will be awesome just like they were with Black Ops. Black Ops 2 has a bright future, and it will be a long wait until another FPS comes out (probably pre-Christmas 2013). Since the list is short for future multiplayer first person shooters, I'd say even with all their hate most likely gamers will purchase this one day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

The buttons are clicky and responsive, and the D-Pad is as refined and perfect as ever, but with slight scoops to fit your thumb better. The light bar is a sleek and cool way to identify your player number in local multiplayer games, and otherwise serves as a slight immersion enhancer as many games utilize it for environmental lighting while gaming in the dark. The rumble capabilities are also greatly enhanced, with multiple motors allowing for precise feedback with a variety of different textures depending on context in gameplay. The touch pad is innovative and intuitive, and the way it is used in games so far is smart, not pushy and annoying. Last but not least, those incredible new analog sticks - now recessed to cradle your thumb, they have a nice rubber texture that provides grip, comfort, and control. They also feature highly refined precision with vastly smaller dead zones and higher resistance, to where they feel sublime. They are so good, in fact, and so accurate, that many developers are removing aim assist from their shooter games because it is no longer needed. Toss in support for any 3.5mm headset (meaning even iPhone headsets can work, reducing cost and increasing availability for chat to everyone), and the built in speaker which hasn't been used quite yet, and you have one perfect, revolutionary controller that aces any genre.

In addition, players can create a custom lightsaber, selecting from hilt design and blade color.

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

You can build up your experience thus gaining levels and hit points by fighting the weaker enemies in chapter one which I'm doing right now before having to go after the mini-bosses or meeting up with them in their location areas.

No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"J.

In fact, the series is still going strong to this day with new games on the PS2 and Gamecube. So Capcom heeded the fans' calls for a sequel, and released RE2 a couple years later. This game ended up being much greater than the original and won over many more gamers with its intense action and edgy suspense. After RE2 received much success, it wouldn't be long before another sequel would be in the works. Come the fall of 1999, RE3 would make its appearance.The first thing most gamers will notice is that RE3 isn't intended to be a full blown sequel, but rather more of a side mission designed specifically for veterans of the first two games who thought they were two easy and wanted something more challenging. Plus it would buy time for the next real sequel, RE: Code Veronica. It's quite clear that Capcom had this group of fans in mind when designing the third game. There are two difficulty settings, and although RE3 isn't intended for newbees of the series, the easy mode does give you plenty of ammo to survive most of the game without any problems. Hard mode, on the other hand, is VERY tough and it teaches you to conserve ammo and health items until they are absolutely needed. And even though it was always important to save the game in the past, it's STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you do it here, because it's that tough. The action is certainly more challenging, and it offers a plethora of small improvements over the other games.The game's only real downfall comes from the fact that the story isn't anywhere near as compelling as the other games, as it just takes place in the same time frame as RE2. Well, specifically, the first half of the game starts a day before the events of RE2 and then the second half picks up several days after that game. Basically, the plot consists of Jill Valentine (star of the first game, and thankfully NOT played by the same voice actress!) trying to escape the streets of the T-Virus infested Raccoon City, all the while avoiding getting killed by the Nemesis (a crazed rocket wielding monster who's out to kill STARS members). There's nothing really surprising to the story, although Jill does encounter numerous mercenaries from Umbrella's evacuation fighting squad. Carlos is the only one Jill spends the most time with and he resembles sort of a love interest for her. Capcom doesn't really succeed as much with these two as say the relationship between Ada and Leon or the young girl Sherry's affection towards Claire, both in the previous game. Still, there are multiple paths and different endings to achieve, so plenty of replayability is here. Thankfully, any fallacy of the story is more than made up for by the gameplay.If you're already a fan of the action from the first two RE games, then you'll love RE3 because there are a TON of additions to make the action segments more enjoyable. For instance, you can now dodge enemies attacks and utilize a quick turn so that running around is a lot easier to do. Plus, there are now interactive environmental items that you can fire at to cause damage to enemies. There's nothing more satisfying than being chased by a group of 8 zombies and then suddenly taking them all out by firing a single shot at an explosive. BANG! How cool is that? BTW, zombies can now run after you and chase you up stairs, so watch out! Another cool feature is the ability to create your own type of ammo by collecting and mixing different gunpowders. Even on hard mode, with the right combinations, you can end up with a LOT of heavy firepower.As for the graphics, sound, and music, they are all nearly identical, so read my comments on them in my RE2 review to get the synopsis. Same with the music, although I will comment on the effectiveness of the music when the Nemesis arrives. It's quite scary when you leave the room that the Nemesis inhabits and then slow eerie music starts playing. You know that the Nemesis is nearby and will attack you at any time. This aspect was done very well.There's only one playable character this time, but the game lasts at least 5-6 hours depending on how fast you go. Not to mention that items and monsters are randomly placed each time you play the game. RE3 does improve on the lack of challenging puzzles from the last game by featuring ones that have random outcomes each time. In fact, one puzzle toward the end of the game took nearly an hour to solve! The scare factor isn't quite as high as in RE2, but a new fear element is introduced and revolves almost entirely around the Nemesis when he's chasing you. The first time I played the game, I thought that killing the Nemesis was impossible, but now I know that even on hard mode you can still best him if you use your resources properly. After the game is done, there's still plenty of unlockable goodies to acquire, such as a timed battle mini game, different outfits, and numerous epilogues to explain the story further.Overall, if you've mastered the first two games and hunger for more, then by all means pick up RE3. It's not perfect, but any older fan will find this game worthwhile. However, NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH THE OTHER GAMES FIRST BEFORE TACKLING ON THIS ONE, AS THEY MAY FIND RE3 TO BE FRUSTRATING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2004"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular, a must-own for every PS3 owner","reviewText":"It feels like it's been forever since the trailer for Killzone 2 debuted at E3 a few years back, but the game is finally here, and every PS3 owner should be glad that it is.  Saying Killzone 2 blows away its predecessor is a gross understatement, as the game lives up to the hype that has been surrounding it since said trailer saw the light of day, and is an absolute must own for every PS3 owner.  The first thing you'll notice about Killzone 2 is that the game is quite simply a sight to behold.  The graphics, overall visuals, and art design that the game boasts are possibly the best to grace the console yet, and the game's sound effects and design are spectacular.  Besides the game's technical achievements, Killzone 2 offers a frantic single player campaign that, while a bit on the short side, boasts some challenging enemy AI and a wonderful array of weapons at your disposal.  The online play however is where Killzone 2 really shines, as the game features some intricately designed multiplayer maps and plenty of rewards that only add to the overall fun that the game has to offer.  While Killzone 2 is definitely a technical powerhouse that delivers what FPS fans look for, it still isn't the Halo killer that Sony has proclaimed it to be in the past.  Despite that though, Killzone 2 is a stunning and spectacular achievement that every PS3 owner should own.  Slowly but surely the PS3 is getting a solid lineup of great, exclusive, triple-A titles that PS3 owners have been long overdue in having.  Along with the Resistance series, the PS3 now has a couple FPS franchises that rival whatever Microsoft has to offer.  Stop reading, pick this game up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2009"}

These are the biggest maps I have ever seen in any AC game.  The maps themselves are also completely different and have a totally different vibe and flow to them.  New and bigger maps this game has in spades.  So why doesn't this add up to a better game?  The simple answer is, it's just not as fun.  Why?? Well, it's not from any one thing in particular, but more so because of so many little things.  Things that could have been cleaned up with more game testing I imagine.  So here's my list of AC3 gripes:Level design - the buildings are a lot more spaced apart in this game, which is probably more accurate, but at the same time makes it a lot harder to escape from your enemies.Stuck at the loading screen - As I was playing through the story-line quests, I found myself spending at least 50% of my time stuck staring at the loading screen.  The game loads for every little thing and exercising the fast travel option exacerbates this problem even more.Miscellaneous bugs - Less responsive attack & counter combat system, random townsfolk that disappear in the middle of the road, and the seemingly more frequent problem of climbing up a wall when I want to run by it phenomenon.Unfortunately, all of these little annoyances just wore me down from really enjoying this game.3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"P","summary":"Where do I even begin with this game?","reviewText":"I purchased this game last year but stop playing due to bugs in the pc version which cause me to be stuck in certain areas plus I couldn&#8217;t get into the storyline at all. I just recently forced myself to finish this game and write a review about what I thought about it. I just wanted to say I absolutely loved arkham asylum and city which are two of my most favorite games ever. However this one was the worst one of them I felt. The game started out good up to the 1st boss fight but as soon as you get out into the city you can immediately tell that most of it was reused from arkham city! I wanted to give the new developers a chance to prove themselves with this game but you can tell that it was a complete cash grab buy using the arkham series to make a safe and quick buck.First let me start off with what I did like and enjoy about this game. The graphics on pc were really well done and the game looked and ran smooth for the most part except for the bugs in some areas.  The quick travel batwing was a nice addition to the game and helped saved time in gliding from area to area in the city. I loved the fact that that added the batcave in this game to me it is an important base to have in the batman series.  It spent a lot of time just wondering around talking to Alfred and the training area.  The deathstroke fight was both exciting and fun to play through trying to counter his moves as well as trying to land a solid hit on him. It kept you on your toes trying to figure out what he would do next but unfortunately that is the only biggest highlight in the game. The new voices of batman and joker did a really good job at holding the game up but not even they could save the game from it awful storyline.I want to talk about what I didn&#8217;t like about the game starting with the villains. The developers picked a straight D list of villains to appear in this game. The only two who I thought might show potential was shiva and deathstoke. While I found the deathstroke fun and exciting the shiva fight was a complete let down.  They made her out to be a fearsome and deadly assassin but when you finally fight her it is nothing but her throwing around cryptic messages and summoning ninjas to come and fight you. As for the rest of the villains like firefly, electrocutioner, killer croc cooperhead and deadshot were a complete joke.Next the things I didn&#8217;t like about the city and a few of the characters. The city itself was devoid and lifeless with most of it being reused from arkham city! There were very few cars or even ppl out on the streets. As a matter of fact the only ppl out on the street were corrupt police officers and henchmen. I found detective Gordon to be a completely annoying character complaining most the time. The side characters like penguin, anarky, mad hatter and riddler were just put into the game just to fill a space as busy work not really serving a purpose in the game.Finally the storyline itself which starts out interesting takes a turn for the worst once joker makes his appearance.  It starts off with trying to establish the relationship batman has with all these characters to throwing it all out the window to focus completely on the joker. While I do like joker they let him take up way to much of the spotlight in this game all the way up until the end. I felt they could have left joker out of this game and maybe focus more on blackmask or even another one of batmans main villains not shown in this game.There were a few parts I did enjoy about this game but not enough for me to like it. I could go on but I feel like most of what I didn&#8217;t like about the game has already been said on other websites as well as a few comments on amazon. All in all I would say just skip this game and wait for the new arkham knight game coming out this year by Rocksteady the devolpers of the first and second arkham games. I think arkham knight will take the series back to the greatness after the cash grab of origins.2/5 DLC &#8211; InitiationSeven dollars for less than 30min Dlc are you serious? You can go to the movies and watch a 2hr show and get more enjoying for cheaper! This dlc server no purposes what so ever to the game. It is suppose to tell the back story of how Bruce Wayne meet one of his fighting instructors and trains in his quest to to be one of the best fighters. Instead it is 3 brawler fights and 2 stealth tests and no real back story about his master.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

The system seems to keep evolving as time goes on.  There are a lot of AAA+ titles for it now, so it's well past the launch stage, and these games are EXCELLENT.  I find myself playing the Vita almost as much as my PS4.  And now with remote view and second screen capability, the Vita is even more a must-have when you go next-gen with the PS4.  You can actually play your PS4 through the Vita while someone else is watching the TV, if you need to.  Awesome!I appreciate that the controls are better suited for adult hands; mores than the PSP, which I had to sell because the controls were too small and it hurt my hands.  Yet now you can play old PSP games (and some PS3 games) on the Vita, too!  The rear touchpad is truly an innovation and works very precisely (Tearawayis a stellar game for this, in particular, but it also provides extra buttons when streaming remote play from the PS4, and works surprisingly well).Uncharted: Golden Abyss - PlayStation Vitais awesome (and free with PS+!!!), as well as the Assassin's Creed entry,Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.  There are so many great small studio/indie games, too, as well as the \"definitive\" editions of many mobile device games (re-written for the Vita, so you get the full spectrum of controls, not only a touchpad)!  Thomas Was Alone is one such game (also a PS+ game as of this writing).  PS+ pays off in dividends, completely.  Also, if you have a previous PSN account, games you purchased in the past can be easily re-downloaded by simply restoring the licenses.PS+ has more than paid for itself, as well; in the first few months I've gotten games on both PS4 and Vita (some of which are cross-platform) for free (and others are discounted when you have PS+!), that I would have paid full-price for, easily.  Sony is providing TOP NOTCH games through PS+, and it feels like a massive gold mine of value compared to all that was previously spent on Xbone Live, which never provided ANYTHING except \"access\" to play online.  Xbone is gone; MS is liquidating the entire division.  Sony is here to stay, taking us into the next generation of gaming!  It's an awesome time to be a gamer.Lastly, I got the 3G version (I happened upon a PS4/Vita bundle, and that's what it came with), but seeing as Amazon has them for roughly the same price, I recommend getting the 3G/Wi-fi version.  I only use wifi, but some day in the future, if I need 3G, I will have it available, all I have to do is enable it.

With Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne and now the two Digital Devil Sagas, the Final Fantasys and other Square-Enix games have some creative competition.After reading all the reviews and looking into this game, I was really excited to try it.  I am about 20 hours (my characters are around lvl 44) into the game and for all intents and purposes I think I've only scratched the surface.  I wanted to give my current review of the game up to this moment to let people uncertain if they want to purchase it what the game is about.It has aptly been called a dark pokemon game.  This is true in that you must negotiate with demons and find ways to recruit them to your side.  However, a downfall to this sytem is that it boils down to you giving up hard won items like healing items, items to ressurect your people, 100s of Macca (the currency).  And normally it goes, \"that is not enough, give me 1 life stone...I'm still not convinced give me 500 Macca...okay you're starting to piss me off, give me 1 revival bead...no, I'm sorry but I don't want to join you.\"  So you just wasted 500 Macca, 1 life stone and 1 revival bead on someone who just vanishes.  If at any time you say no, the negotiations stop.  Now, other demons you get can learn skills to help in the negotiation process.  But, sometimes it's hard to justify an ability like Nag that is supposed to help get uncertain demons when you can only have 6 skills.  If it comes down to learning that next heal spell or Nag, I'm going to have to go with the healing spell over Nag.  So it can be frustrating to get some demons to your side.  Other times it's s snap.Then, you are able to fuse these demons together to create more powerful demons that share some of the qualities and skills of the previous two you had.  More depth is added by the change of the moon cycle and the ability to sacrifice a third demon to make your demons even more powerful.  It's a cool concept that works really well for the most part.  IF you know what you're doing.Which leads me to my biggest problem with the game.  If you don't carefully plan out your demons and your demon fusing even early in the game, you will have a very hard time as the game progresses.  You see, another concept that figures heavy into the battle system is the weakness/strength based on skills.  Some enemies are weak to your skills, some nullify certain skills, some drain hp from skills, some reflect these abilities, etc etc.  If you score a hit the enemy is weak against, you gain another turn to act in your round.  If your attack is nullified, you lose turns.  The same happens to you.  So, if you end up fusing demons together and have to fight a boss that your new demon is weak to, problems can occur.  Especially if that demon is your healer and is killed in round two...On top of that, when you fuse demons you don't get all of the skills the previous demons had.  You get a random assortment based on luck and what levels your demons are.  The higher the level the more skills transfer.  The result is that you end up getting two demons chosen for fusing, don't like the abilities, so leave the fusing process and go back in until you get a mix of skills you want.  Also, each demon can only hold a certain amount of skills and when they learn new skills and the demon is maxed, you have to get rid of one of their skills.  And that skill is gone forever.  Chances are, you'll need that skill that you just lost at a future time.  What seems unimportant now, can end up saving your life later.  And it can be frustrating, trying to create your characters as the best of what they can do and then have normal enemies or boss battles trounce you in two rounds.I have been playing RPGs since the very first Final Fantasy graced our shores.  I have never found an RPG as hard as this one.  In fact, with the exception being a COUPLE boss battles that I can count on one hand, I almost never die in an RPG.  This game gives you two settings to choose from at the beginning, normal and hard.  I chose normal.  Traveling in the over world map, in areas where a character of my level is supposed to be can become death traps if you happen to run into an enemy that has attacks your party is weak against.  Or, heaven forbid, your main character is weak against.  Ran into a group of characters who have a death attack.  I had spent about an hour grinding in the field (you'll also be doing that a lot by the way) only to have someone cast Mudo, a death type spell, on my main character.  He's not weak to the attack but the attack went through, character died, there went 1 hour of my leveling.  You can only save in terminals, not on the world map and in this instance I was pretty far from a terminal and didn't want to spend the extra travel time just to get back and save.  Be warned, save often!Also, in reference to the weakness/strength problem, you are given the skill Analyze.  It will give you the enemies hp/mp and their strengths and weaknesses.  So this is good, right?  Well it doesn't work on bosses which can become a trial and error as you probably won't have the right combination of people the first time you fight the boss.  Chances are, you will wipe.  The guide book is more helpful in this area and can usually help you prepare better (see my book comment below).The game can be classified as a dungeon crawl.  Not in the typical sense, but in the sense that no matter where you go chances are there will be enemies to fight.  Finding areas of safety where you won't run into random encounters are few and far between.  In my 20 hours of playtime I have run into less than 5 I believe.  Most \"towns\" (I use that term loosely) where you can save/heal/buy/sell/fuse/etc have enemy encounters.  On top of that, the encounter rates are higher than most RPGs.  Sometimes you can run through a room with little or no encounters.  Other times, you can run into battle after battle.  There is a glowing compas on your UI that is supposed to alert you by changing colors as it gets closer to an encounter but that's not always truthful.  It has gone from yellow (the first step) to red (the last) in one step and a battle starts.So far, the story is pretty linear and honestly not too exciting.  As far as I know, it's mainly a quest to find this guy and stop his plans of unleashing a very bad weapon.  Yes, the story is dark, deals with the end of the world and also has angels and demons and familiar religious mantra in it but at this point in time it's not too terribly exciting.  I'm hoping that something will happen that will change the focus of the story.I cannot recommend this game to RPG newbies.  You will be frustrated and might not ever play an RPG again.  This is not a starter's RPG; it's made for the hard core group of people as you have to put a lot of time and effort into it.  I would also recommend picking up the strategy guide.  I don't normally do or recommend that, but at 400 pages it is almost essential in creating the best demon combinations and working your way through some really tough bosses.If you are new to the Shin Megami Tensei series, personally I would recommend the newer Digital Devil Saga (and its forthcoming sequel).  Almost all of my complaints above are addressed and fixed in that game; it also adds sorely needed voice actors and at this juncture in time has a better plot.I know it seems as if there are a lot of \"complaints\" in my review which might seem incongruous with my score of 4.  But I'm not exactly complaining; I just want to make sure that those who are on the fence with this game know all of the good and bad inside.  I think it has the ability to really frustrate some players and I would hate to have new RPGers come to this game and decide the genre is not for them.  I am enjoying the game for the most part, though I think I might enjoy Digital Devil Saga I and II better.  Truth be told, the dugeon I'm currently in (the Obelisk for those who know) is kicking my ass which made me turn to Digital Devil Saga.  For Nocturne, the combat system is deep and rewarding for those who play right, the dungeons are (mostly) long but fun and I have a feeling the plot is going to rachet up another level soon.  But casual gamers need not apply.**By the way, don't you dare spend the $60-80 on this game that the people are selling theirs through this site!  That's outrageous that people are already selling it at that price.  Check out Ebgames or Gamestop, etc.  I got mine a few weeks ago for $44.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2005"}

The features, apps, and Kinect 2.0's fluidity is unparalleled.  The voice recognition is spot on.  Being able to navigate the dashboard, Skype, Youtube, the XBL Store, and even TV is incredibly easy.  The motion detection is extremely accurate as well.  Though I have only used it sparingly, I have had no issues imposing my will.  And the OS (operating system) is something to marvel at.  The multitasking again, is incredible.  A lot of people will say &#34;oh well, why would I want to do that&#34;.  Well, being able to Skype, and check in on a score of a football game, or make sure your DVR is set for your favorite show, it is quick and it's simple, and satisfying.  Here is another example.  Perhaps you are playing a game, and a close friend, calls you via Skype, you answer, and lose no progress in your game, and can even continue playing while your on Skype.  And perhaps you want to check the store, because said friend reminds you of some DLC or a game, you just enter the store with either a simple voice command (WHILE ON SKYPE STILL, AND PLAYING A GAME), or using your controller and download the DLC while playing your game, and on Skype, and installing the DLC or game.  The XB1 can do it all, and with no issues.  I love this system.  Congrats Microsoft, on a revolutionary system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Or at least I take back the overly hateful tone.I haven't played the game again, but I overreacted, and I feel stupid that I crapped all over a piece of art like Shadow of the Colossus. It's just that I enjoyed Ico so much - it's one my favorite games of all time - and I had a knee-jerk and emotional reaction to not getting Ico 2. One day I'm going to play SotC again, and I still don't think I'll like it as much as Ico, but this review sounds very immature.**Old original review:It's probably my fault but I was hugely disappointed in this game. I was hoping for something more along the lines of Ico since the makers of this game also made that one. Ico was one of the best games I've played on the PS2, up there with one of my all time favorites. A beautitful game filled with challenging puzzles and tons of emotion and atmosphere. For Collosus They kept the beautiful, artistic graphics and same look and feel yet dumped everything else. All that's left is riding around on a horse with absolutely nothing to do in between fighting the collosi. No I'm not looking for wave after wave of meaningless monsters and fights. This is an unfinished game. I really believe the developers started with this outline but couldn't finish perhaps because their ideas were too grandiose. This is a demo.The horse is an excellent idea and everything about is well done so it's a shame it goes to waste. Fighting each collosus is interesting and fun, but after 5 or 6 of them it's gets very repetitive. You spend time and energy finally figuring out their patterns and weak spots, which is good in itself, but you get nothing for your effort except to do it all over again.Come on let's stop with all the way overboard rave reviews here. Someone said it's like \"Ico meets Metroid Prime.\" Stop it, it's nothing like Metroid Prime and all the stuff that made Ico good was taken out. I know I'm going to get a lot of negative votes for this review but somebody has to step up and give an alternate opinion and warn Ico players before they waste their money.The bottom line: Ico was a fantastic, once in a lifetime game filled with umatched atmosphere, emotion and gameplay. Surely something close to Ico 2 would be made right? No, Ico didn't sell all that well. Water it down, take out the complexity and puzzles. Fight big monsters. Ride horse. There ya go, Shadow has been a best seller. What a disgrace.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"The adventure of a LIFETIME!  My favorite video game, ever.","reviewText":"Since my semi-retirement from video games, I feel like I've lost touch with some of the new games of today.  A lot has happened in my life (which is why you'll find a 2+ year gap between a couple of my reviews), and have focused on school and other things.  But I've been meaning to get this review up for a long time, and it's high time I did that.  I'll try not to go \"nerdy\" here, but this is my personal favorite video game, not only on the Super NES, but of all time.I'm probably not the only one that shares this, as in a recent Nintendo Power magazine fans voted Chrono Trigger #3 most wanted game to be put on the Wii console, right behind #2's Super Mario RPG and #1's Terra-Gnigma.  And it's also coming to Nintendo DS.Chrono Trigger follows the tale of time traveling adventurers.  Marle, the princess of Guardia, is whisked through time accidently by Lucca's transporter and Crono (the lead character who rarely speaks) decides to go and save her, which leads to a series of time altering events, new characters, and the ultimate final battle with Lavos.  Lavos is the main villain, a parasitic life form that's been on the planet since the stone age and used the world's resources to allow mankind to evolve, thus empowering Lavos for millenia until 1999 A.D., when Lavos nearly wipes out the human race.  We are introduced to awesome playable characters: Frog, formerly a knight named Glenn from the middle ages; Magus, a sorceror from the dark magical age that Frog seeks revenge upon; Robo, a robot from the future and turns against the evil robots and develops his own personality (a la Data from Star Trek).  Lucca, Crono's friend, is a super smart inventor with a childhood regret.  Ayla, a prehistoric babe that seeks retribution against the Reptites in the Prehistoric Age.  And Marle, the future ruler of Guardia, and is swept up in a tale of high adventure and time.The characters are very memorable and even if you were playing today, you'd be rooting for them during the game.  Magus is out to destroy Lavos and is very narcissistic, especially towards Frog; Frog is a young heroic knight who carries the burden of failing to save Cyrus, his hero.  Marle wants to be free despite her royal upbringing.  Lucca yearns to correct her mistake of failing to save her mother from injury.  Robo aspires to become more human and constructive, and by the end of the game, he'll be one of your favorite characters.  Ayla's warrior-like personality may have you thinking impure thoughts about a Super NES character (and she's bisexual, in the original Japanese translation, LOL)... and Crono is the main hero and rarely speaks, but his heroic nature and adventorous spirit is the drive of the story.There are many aspects of this game to appreciate.  The intricate storyline with multiple endings might seem common now, but back then, it was practically unheard of.  There's also some dark parts in the storyline (Frog having to avenge Cyrus because Magus killed him, Lucca feeling responsible for her mother's injury, etc.) as well as downright goofy parts (\"Knights of the Square Table\"?  And what's with pouring soda on Toma's grave?).  The music, mostly contributed by Yasunori Mitsuda, is considered a classic SNES gem and is actually the most covered game of all time on OCRemix.org (I think it's got 87 remixes, as of this writing).  This soundtrack NEVER gets old.  I read in an interview that Mitsuda had ulcers making the score and Nobuo Uematsu and Norika Matsueda had to finish the soundtrack (only a few tracks); he loved doing the score so much that he had ulcers.  Hardcore!Gameplay wise, it's relatively simple by today's standards.  You've three of your characters in battle and depending on your combination, the double tech and triple tech combinations are different.  I always found this to be unique, and haven't seen it utilized much in later games.  The graphics were outstanding for the time; animated in a colorful and very Toriyama-esque style, its pretty smooth for a Super Nintendo game.  The magic spells look fantastic, even in 1995 when this game first came out.I didn't find this too harsh in difficulty growing up, and I still find it to be relatively easy.  I think this is a definite plus because if you are a young pup and want a good dosage of RPG Heaven, then this would be a GREAT place to start.  This is one of the rare games where the creators didn't want to make money off of it, nor did they want to make a turd for a quick buck.  They spent time, energy, and enthusiasm on Chrono Trigger, and honestly, I think it shows (Final Fantasy's Hinorobu Sakaguchi, Dragonwarrior's Yuji Horii, and DBZ's Dragonball Z all worked on this game!).  The storyline combined with awesome music, smooth gameplay, and emotionally-driven characters makes this a rariety.  This game leaves you with a happy feeling and a sense of accomplishment for beating it (and if you're an old school gamer like me, nostalgia as well.).Part of the reason I also love this game was because the friendships I've attained through this game, which might seem a little silly.  But hey, it was 1996, and Chrono Trigger was caught in the \"growing up\" scheme of things.Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially to the first-time gamer.  It's not too difficult and it has a lot to offer.  Now that it's coming to DS with a revamped translation (kinda like what they did with Castlevania Symphony of the Night...), it's easy to obtain.  Or you can also find it on Final Fantasy Chronicles for PlayStation.  Either way, this game is a must-buy... don't pass on the adventure of a lifetime!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2003"}

While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original.

While driving, the road becomes foggy and he barely avoids hitting a girl in the road. When he gets out to look for her, he is follows the young girl until he loses her but comes across a burning building. Travis runs in to see if anyone inside, after traversing the burning house, he finds a girl with 3rd degree burns over most, if not all, of her body, he manages to rescue her before passing out and then waking up in the town of Silent Hill.Gameplay: The game plays like many of the Silent Hill entries before, focusing on puzzles with elements of survival-horror. You'll spend much of your time searching for the next piece of a puzzle while avoiding or fighting demented and warped creatures of Travis' mind.The camera switches between static and moving, at some points, generally in small rooms, the camera is fixed into a certain position. When in larger rooms or halls the camera is behind Travis and can be manipulated with the shoulder buttons.Combat is pretty over-simplified, the left shoulder locks on to enemies while X allows you to attack (or can be held for power attacks). Weapons have slightly different speeds, meaning you'll have to use a bit of strategy for some enemies (obviously, if the enemy is fast, a big sledgehammer is not a wise choice).Graphics: The graphics are pretty good for a slightly older game. Being Silent Hill, the game adopts the old fashioned screen effects such as static when an enemy is near and grain effects. Environments are decently detailed as are the characters. Lighting is done very well and gives the game a very dark feeling.Controls, Voice, Audio and Music: The controls are quite simplistic, as there aren't many buttons on a PSP and will be learned quite quickly. The voice work ranges from acceptable to cheesy, which seems to be a staple for the earlier installments, so I'm not sure if it was intended or not.The audio, when it's there, is well done, lending an ominous vibe to the area around Travis.

(Russians invading America, in Alaska) would have been a great story to finish....instead they just leave you hanging, and you're in with a new group of people, and a completely new story. I thought the B-2 characters and overall chemistry between the characters was great! Especially for a video game..... They were very likable, humorous, and made the player feel like he/she was a part of the game.My 2nd gripe is that in this new B-3, there's very little room for exploring, or doing ANYTHING, except following the red dot. Like, I could figure it out on my own, thank you.... But, it's so strict, and linear....it doesn't feel organic, or natural in any way. Nor, is there any freedom...My 3rd complaint is when you're in the jet fighter, trying to land bombs on a runway. Well, I tried laying down bombs and A-10 attacks for almost 2 hours, and to no avail, I still didn't blast my targets.....I find that a LITTLE hard to believe??????.....Even reset the game multiple times, seeing if there's a glitch???? I started at the same level multiple times....same thing.....over & over again.....So, I pretty much stopped playing.Kinda ridiculous after that......it's like, \"why bother?\"I haven't even got completely through this game yet, but, I can tell I won't be finishing it anytime soon.Shame too, because the game could have been great, but, seems like the game was rushed.....I don't know, just my thoughts.Overall, seems OK to play for an hour, and then put it up on Ebay for $5.00","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Portal expanded....","reviewText":"The original Portal is one of the best video games I've ever played. The puzzles were clever, the narrative was hilarious, the gameplay easy to control, it never wore out it's welcome, and was easy on the wallet (or free if you got it with 'The Orange Box'). Now Portal's full-priced, full-lengthed sequel is out and while it has a lot of the same strengths as the original (along with some fun new features) I'm not sure it'll be worth a purchase for some people.Portal 2 starts with a knock-out opening as you step into the shoes of the original protagonist from the first Portal game. You meet Wheatley (played to comic perfection by Stephen Merchant), a talking robotic eye that is trying to help you escape the Aperture science facility. Before long you accidently wake up GLaDOS, the previous antagonist and are put through another series of \"tests\" as you try and escape the facility alive. The plot's full of the same fun twists and screamingly funny dialogue as the first game though I have to admit by about the four-hour mark (about when the first Portal ended) I was starting to lose interest and by the end (three hours after that) I just didn't care. It's sad when an already short game feels almost too LONG. Also, while the first Portal brilliantly introduced the narrative through the 'test' sequences, the 'tests' in Portal 2 just feel like filler inbetween the actual narrative points.The graphics in Portal 2 might be a disappointment to some as they are EXACT same graphics as the original Portal (slightly better than pre-gen but not as good as current-gen). The animations however are very fluid (check out all of Wheatley's expressions!) and the levels are a lot bigger than the original Portal with a lot more going on in them. There is no slow-down what-so-ever.The gameplay in Portal 2 is just as polished and addicting as the original. When it comes to level design and pacing Valve has no competition and while the puzzles seem a bit easier this time around they're very fun and still make you think. The simplistic jump, carry, shoot mechanic is just as accessible and the new gadgets like the gels add to the fun. The Co-op is also great as it not only continues the story from the single-player (playing the two robots from the campaign), it lets you give easy-to-use hints and commands to your partner as you both use portal guns and have to help each other through five different test chambers.Portal 2 is a very fun game and I highly recommend everyone give it a try, especially fans of the original. However I would be very hesitant to purchase the game at full price. With outdated graphics, a seven hour single player campaign (which loses steam about half-way) and a few hours of Co-Op with little to no replayability I just don't think there's $60 worth of content here. You should be able to see all it has to offer within a couple days so renting Portal 2 might be the best option right now or wait until it drops to a lower price. Again, I want to stress: Portal 2 is a great game and worth your time. I just don't think it's worth the price it's asking.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

With this many cars to choose from, it makes for great replay capability.  The game features several different modes of play including Arcade, career and of course multi-player online, also greatly adding to the replay value.In Arcade mode you can compete in six different vehicle classes.  Most of the cars are selectable but many have to be unlocked through gameplay.  In all the arcade mode offers 186 races in 31 different events making it a tremendous challenge.  But Forza Motorsport really shines with the tremendous career mode option.  You start by selecting your home region which dictates the cars that are available for use with a starting number of six in each region.  From there you start your career at the bottom in the amateur circuit to race and build credits towards buying new cars, buying parts or making modifications to your existing ride.  Just the paint and decal selections to modify your car's look offers hundreds of options.  Credits are also used to unlock higher levels of competition to get more challenges.  There is also a pretty cool reward system where you can gain discounts on parts from certain manufacturers.  When it comes right down to it, the sheer number of option and modifications that you have available to you can be pretty overwhelming, but if you're looking for depth in this department then this is the game for you.The graphics and sound are just fabulous and top Grand Turismo in every way.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Not Just Another Rail Shooter","reviewText":"Dead Space: Extraction is an on-rails shooter that functions as a prequel story to the acclaimed PS3/360 shooterDead Space. When an outbreak spreads across Aegis VII that turns the population of the colony into bloodthirsty Necromorphs, you lead a band of survivors to safety on the starship Ishimura. Only, it turns out the Ishimura is experiencing an outbreak of its own.The Wii has played host to a rail-shooter revival, and gamers interested in that old school, arcade experience have several fine options to choose from, includingHouse of the Dead: OverkillandResident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles. Dead Space: Extraction is another strong addition to the list, offering up several key design changes that keep the formula from getting stale.The first notable difference is that the game places a heavy emphasis on narrative. You don't simply load up the levels and start shooting - you'll converse with the characters from a first-person perspective, figure out what needs to be done and move out towards your objectives. Enemies will attack in bursts (much like your typical survival horror game), and then you'll get a bit more narrative, sneak around more corridors and sewers, fight some more, and repeat. Developer Visceral Games has opted to create a slow-burning, immersive experience over the loud, relentless hammering of its genre counterparts. So you won't always be poised with your finger on the trigger, but you'll get to know your fellow survivors and feel like you're part of their world. The story tosses a few twists at you, including switching up perspectives (surprisingly, not everyone you play as makes it out alive). In all, the story elements expand each level's playtime significantly, so be prepared to drop upwards of half an hour on certain segments of the game.The action in Dead Space: Extraction builds gradually - Necromorphs will come at you in manageable waves early on, but by the end of the game you'll be swarmed by a variety of foes at different speeds, some lobbing projectiles, some flying overhead. Your ammo, with the exception of your default weapon, is limited to what you pick up, so you'll need to pick your shots carefully as you dismember your opponents limb by limb (popping a Necromorph's head only encourages them to swing at you recklessly). I like the challenge, but some sections almost border on unfair with the projectile-shooting enemies obscuring themselves at the far end of a level while a bloated Necromorph explodes to unleash little starfish which you have to shake off with your wiimote (possibly the most annoying enemy in the game). For such a story driven game, a few moments stretch credibility as your player stands and fights while a retreat would be more appropriate. To help you in disposing of enemies, you'll have access to a stasis beam which lets you freeze enemies, and collectable upgrades add to your overall firepower. Other touches Dead Space: Extraction adds are more interaction with the environment. You'll be opening doors, soldering connections together to override computers in a pointer-based mini game, grabbing and launching objects with a kinesis beam and riveting objects together (often to barricade yourself against approaching enemies).Where does the game fail? Even with it's lengthy levels, the overall experience is a tad short. There are only 10 missions, with the last one feeling slightly anti-climactic by the lack of a true boss monster. You'll open up challenge levels for score rankings, but otherwise you won't find extra story missions or the breadth of goodies the Resident Evil and House of the Dead games have offered (an unlockable motion comic is a nice bonus, but isn't terribly compelling to sit through). Worst of all, the game seems prone to bugs and crashes. In one section my character refused to move on after clearing a hallway of enemies, and in the last level the game crashed during the final cutscene (forcing me to start over).Unfortunate glitches aside, Dead Space: Extraction still remains a top-notch game for the console. With so many shooters opting for \"quick time events\" and placing players on linear paths to create a \"cinematic experience\", it seems the genre is sliding towards rail-shooters anyway. Dead Space: Extraction finds a great balance where a lack of free movement doesn't equate to a dumbed-down experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000NGP1R8","description":"Dr. Aiden Krone is a former professor of Applied Physics at MIT, notorious for his unrivaled brilliance and obsession with Thermodynamics, Advanced Propulsion, and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  Despite his increasing tendencies to demand control and secrecy, he became the Founder and Lead Physicist of a classified Time Travel research program.  Over a decade later, Krone's program had successfully developed the world's first time-traveling suit technology.  However, as the program's equally secretive decision-makers demanded this technology be adapted for military applications, Krone's feelings of self-entitlement and anger grew.  He secretly desired a new existence, a new world where his scientific endeavors could be shaped and experienced without outside interference.  The combination of Krone's mind and his suit technology gave him the ability to create and control another existence - an existence where a man of science could finally operate without restrictions and do so within a place where science itself was properly respected&#xBF; regardless of the effects on humanity.  It is now up to you to trace Krone's last known appearances and stop his tyrannical rule over Alpha District.

That's not bad, because I love futuristic shooters, but Timeshift is basically run-of-the-mill.It definitely has its strong points.  You can save anywhere (why doesn't everyone do this?????), there's no frame rate problems, graphics and enemy AI are very nice, and the craft design is especially good.  I love the future-past blimps.  Weapons also work well and are mostly appropriate, although it often takes half a clip to kill someone if it isn't a head shot.The time shifting, the game's big selling point, is pretty cool.  I wish the \"stop\" function lasted as long as the \"slow\" function, but you can't have everything.  The fighting situations encourage you to use them, too.  Often enemies are way off, and you don't get a sniper rifle until later (and when you do it's best to ditch it soon after the initial use is over for something more appropriate to what's coming), so your best bet is to slow or stop time and move to closer cover.  Not bad, but I like to hang back and take them out from a distance.  And playing with time is nothing new, so that hook for this game doesn't dig too deep (ugh, sorry for the bad analogy).Luckily, the \"crossbow\" gun (no, not arrows, just the way it looks), is especially cool.  It has a zoom scope and fires explosive pellets.  The moment I got it I kept one on hand the entire rest of the game.  It makes the conventional sniper rifle almost completely unnecessary.Otherwise, though, there's nothing really new or special in the gameplay.  The controls are bizarre at first, too.  There's certainly nothing bad about Timeshift, it just doesn't advance the genre in any way.  It's a very well done but unremarkable shooter and little more.  If you just plain like shooters, it's worth having.  If you're looking for something to really impress, this isn't it.  In it's defense, a thought just occurred to me, though.  Just how many more ideas for a first-person shooter are there?  Maybe I'm expecting too much......","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2008"}

This is for the hardcore RPG players only.Brutal. That is the first word that will come out of your mouth when playing this game. This is for the hardcore only and I strictly warn you before plunking down $40 for this game and regretting the purchase like I did. This isn't your straight up hack & slash game. Oh no not by any means. This game is all about level grinding and repetition. You will be punished for even trying to take that last-minute hit. What's the punishment? Going back the last save. Ha if only that were true here. You have to restart the entire level every time you die and you lose all your souls (XP). Yeah I screamed what as well when I found this out.The game is also hard to figure out. I had to do some research online to figure out how to play Demon's Souls because most RPG's aren't like this. Instead of a story that you follow through and advance through a game you get stuck in a central hub and have 5 connecting levels. You have to repeat these levels dozens of times to level up. You can go into any level whenever you want, and each level has four sections with a boss at the end of each section. Just getting through stage 1-1 was a pain in the ass. I died about over 20 times before beating that section.Another thing you will never know how to do is level up. It doesn't just happen like most RPG's. You have to get all your souls back to the Nexus (hub) without dying and talk to the Maiden in Black to level up. There are 999 levels and each time you upgrade and attribute that bumps you up one level. So if you upgrade strength, vitality, and dexterity that's bumps you up three levels. So once you figure this out you have to start soul grinding until you get to a high enough level that you won't die with every swing.Don't panic when you die though. If you manage to get back to the spot you died at without dying again you can reclaim all your lost souls and they will be added to what you currently have. Die before you reach there and the count is reset. This makes the game so frustrating and I even almost got an aneurysm from the frustration. A lot of enemies are tough and the fighting mechanics aren't all that smooth so you have to learn them and execute them well. It's all about skill.The fighting mechanics are pretty decent. You have a light and heavy attack as well as a block and parry button. All these are mapped to the shoulder buttons. You can switch weapons out with the left and right D-pad (assign them in your menu). Another flaw the game has, and doesn't make any sense, is that you can't sell items but only drop them. You think selling these would make getting souls easier, but From Software just had to make things that more difficult. On top of this you have a burden count (think Oblivion) and getting new armor and weapons isn't easy. You can upgrade weapons and armor by finding stones. These can only be upgraded at the Nexus (as far as I know).Another flaw this game has is there's no pause button. Yeah what? I couldn't believe you can't pause the game it's that hardcore. You just have to stand in a safe spot. This game goes out of its way to make you hate it to death. Yet there's something that makes you keep playing. You just want to keep leveling up and getting the next boss and fighting you way through the game. This is probably because you get so angry that you just won't let the game win. This also means you needs hours of your day to play this game since this is by no means a pick up and play game.I was so angry about the game that I didn't even mention the story. The story goes along the lines of a Deep Fog that has taken over the land of Boletaria and you must defeat the demons holding it there. It's not really much to ponder on, but its enough to keep you going. The voice acting is iffy and you will spend so much time leveling up you will probably forget all about the story.The game does do something unique and this is its online mode. Instead of having co-op or anything like that other people can help everyone else through hidden messages or bloodstains. If you come across a message you can read it and it will give you hints to help you through the level. These are pre-made messages that people can enter to helps others out. Most of the time these are helpful, but a lot are tricks. Bloodstains are a player that most recently died in that spot and you can watch their \"ghost\" to avoid getting killed yourself. Some times you will see white ghosts floating around in real-time and these are other players that you can watch to give you a hint. This is very unique and innovative, but the frustration of the game makes you quickly forget about it all.The game looks pretty decent. The graphics are a bit bland in areas, but its technically sound. There are some glitches like collision detection issues and wonky physics. Overall Demon's Souls is for the hardcore only enough said. If you want a hack & slash that's simple and fun don't get this game stay far away. So why did I give this such a high score if I hate it so much? Because the game is good itself and I just don't have the patience for this type of game. I'm not going to punish the game for my inability to play it so the people who can play this will enjoy it. It'll take you a good 10-15 hours just to figure out all the stats and how the game is played, another 10-15 to get your bearings and level up enough to attempt the game, and about 50+ just to get through the game. Each boss feels like a triumph and is very rewarding, but this game only rewards the patient.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I am surprised by all the five star reviews. This game is unforgiving. It is more frustrating than fun. If you are looking for a challenge this game is it. However, if you are looking for a casual RPG steer clear. Everything in the game is driven by souls. Souls are the coin of the realm. If you die you lose all your souls, and they are left back at the point where you died. If you die again trying to get back to the last spot where you last died, all your souls from the previous death are gone for good. Also, the online play options are fairly non-standard and leave you with little control as far as choosing when and where you will play. I think the online elements are useful from a helpful hint standpoint and utterly useless in all other aspects. I actually find watching other player's \"ghost\" a distraction and annoyance. I think this game will have a fairly die hard following, and offers up many challenges. If you are looking for a game to make you suffer, this is it.The game play is hack and slash with RPG character development elements. But, you have to be careful as you'll lose your life quickly unless you plan out your attacks carefully. This game is not anything like the type of hack and slash action offered up by Dynasty Warriors (which in my mind is a good thing). There is a depth to the combat system that is missing from many hack and slash games, although Demon Souls roots can probably be located in the hack and slash genre. Often the controls are not as smooth as they should be given how punitive this game is, but overall they are suited for the style of game.It is a good game, but not perfect. This game will probably lead to a few broken controllers and more than a few popped blood vessels. I would recommend it, but with reservations. I am finding myself both loving it, and hating it all at the same time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2009"}

I can't say that the the 1st game was all that great, but SH 2 was awsome.Many are comparing this series to the FF series.  I'm a big FF fan, but it does not compare to SH, simply because of the judgement ring.The judgement ring takes some hand/eye cordination and if you miss, your attack/magic won't go through.  However, getting perfects on the judgement ring, your attacks/magic are more powerful, therefore, dealing much more damage.The characters in this game are amazing.  The only problem I had was deciding who to use throughout the game.  Another problem I had was that Yuri had too many fusions to choose from and it took a while to level them up.The storyline moves along nicely and if it gets to be to much, you can always take a breather and do any side quests available.  Doing the sidequests as soon as you can is always a good thing, because usually you'll be rewared with rare and valuable items.I suggest trying to play through SH 1 if you are thinking of playing SH 2  in order for the \"good ending\" to make sense and have a better understanding of the main character, Yuri.In other words, the story, the graphics, the characters,even the cut scenes, everything about this game is amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2007"}

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil.

Is that a good thing? Well, yeah. In fact, the first NSMB's popularity wasn't really stolen.It's an all-new 2D Mario game for the home consoles, and with an extremely huge twist. Along with going through 8 hugely awesome worlds, and beating the everloving heck out of Goombas in classic Mario gameplay, you get to do all this....with your buddies! 4 players sharing the same screen cooperating together in a 2D Mario game? Cool! The downside to that, however, is how terrible we can all be when it comes to one person stealing another's power-up, or maybe one player would \"accidentally\" throw the other player into the lava or spike pits. The solution? Press A and you will float in a bubble....but someone must pop the bubble to free you.The power-ups are now different from the DS game. Here, you get the Propeller suit. Shake the Wii Remote to rise up into the air. If you were to remove the propeller, it'd make an awesome racing suit for Mario Kart. Next is the penguin suit, in which you slide on your stomach, bashing through blocks with your face, while also shooting snowballs at your enemies. The Ice Flower lets you JUST shoot snowballs. The Fire Flower lets you shoot fireballs, of course. Since when has that changed?You can also be able to ride (drum roll please) YOSHI!!! 4 of them, in fact! A player can also be eaten so he/she can ride in Yoshi's mouth while the controlling player (riding Yoshi) makes his/her way through the many obstacles of a level. Sadly, there are few levels with him.There are no freakish minigames, this time, but there is still a VS Mode. Wanna collect more coins than the other? Wanna beat each other up? There you go. Play that here.Overall, this game would possibly beat Super Smash Bros. Brawl as one of the best multiplayer experiences on the Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

My guess is that this will make for a very good movie.- the plasmids (powers), while not being an original idea (Star Wars?), have been mapped the best possible way to the controller and are a joy to use.And - here is why the game fails terribly:- the gameplay could have been so much better, but - in the end - it burns down to the 20 year old formula of finding the 'key'. Probably the most ridiculous task in any modern game makes its way in one of the levels, where you do not need to find 1 or 3 or 5 'keys', but 21 (yes, twenty-one!) items, in order to progress! While 14 of them are straight forward for anyone that played Quake or Doom or Duke Nukem (meaning gamers with lots of patience!), the last 7 require finding randomly teleporting enemies.

I checked them on various websites about fake remotes.  I found two little differences, one was the plastic was a little different in the battery chamber, and the other difference was in the stamp on the end where you hook up the nunchuck.  Everything else matched up with the real remote checklists.  We've used them for several hours of playing now and seem to work just as well as our other real remotes.The other difference was the packaging.  These remotes just game wrapped in foam with an instruction manual.  There was no plastic box like is shown in the picture.  It makes me wonder if Nintendo is trying to phase these out so they can make more money on the remote plus, but they ordered a new batch because people are still buying these.We'll update here if something goes wrong with them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"I was really, totally surprised...","reviewText":"I'm somewhat picky when it comes to video games.  I found it funny when one review said, \"picky gamers: beware.\"I was going to rent a simple-minded first-person-shooter this weekend.  I was actually looking to rent Modern Warfare - a game that basically requires no creativity whatsoever and is nothing more than a simple \"point and shoot\" affair.  I wanted MW because I was going to do some online gaming with a good friend and we generally enjoy different types of games (he's a zombie/anime fan, while I prefer sci-fi and racing titles.)Anyways, MW was all checked-out.  I almost walked away, when I saw several copies of Borderlands sitting on the shelf.  I had heard a few good things, and thought, \"hey, for 8 bucks, what have I got to lose?\"Five days later, I now own a copy of Borderlands.This game is incredibly simple-minded.  You pick your character from a list of four based on their emphasis in one or two particular skills and a specialty \"trait\" such as a deployable gun turret or temporary invisibility.  You then get dropped off in a little shanty town that isn't hard to cope with if you've ever played Fallout 3.  From there it's a simple affair of collecting and managing an inventory, killing baddies and spending skill points earned with a simple leveling system.  Trust me - Borderlands isn't rewriting the books here.But what Borderlands DOES do is effectively merge the best of a few played-out worlds.  The first-person shooting aspects are on par with most recent FPS games, with the exception of any kind of cover system.  I don't miss the cover system because it makes combat a bit more frantic.  Still, there are often plenty of obstructions to put between you and enemies, giving you chance to recharge shields, grab ammo, reload weapons, and sometimes even flank enemies to gain an edge.Merged in to the typical FPS fare is a role-playing-inspired leveling/skill system.  Now, Star Ocean/Fallout3/Oblivion/Final Fantasy fans might balk here, and trust me - I agree.  This is NOT a role-playing game.  But leveling gives you a feeling of progression and obvious reward for your efforts.  Experience is earned from nearly everything - even running folks over in a truck.  With each new level, a skill point is awarded which can be spent on more damage, more health, or improving your character-specific ability (such as more damage from the gun turret, or shorter cool-down periods for using the ability.)But above all, this game allows one thing that almost no other FPS does - the ability to call your own shots.  At any time you can have multiple missions available - no different from a questing system with other RPG's.  You can work them at your own pace, quit them mid-mission (by simply walking away, even) and in some cases, avoid them entirely.  The ability to ask yourself, \"What do I want to do next\" is what makes ANY game great in my opinion.And since - though unusual for me - I intended to play this game online, I can say that the coop aspects of this game are quite frankly a heckuva lotta fun.  Missions completed in coop award experience, money and loot to all players who have not already completed the mission in single-player mode.  Mixing characters provides diversity to combat - allowing players to stay within their comfort zone.  Friendly fire is nixed since there's a LOT of fire taking place, and in general coop play is as frantic and fast-paced as the players want it to be.  My buddies and I have already had countless hours of fun in coop play, and I find myself yearning for the experience.Borderlands isn't without flaws.  The biggest annoyance in my opinion is the respawning of enemies within various levels - fighting your way to a boss makes much more sense than fighting your way out afterwards.  There's a comfort in knowing you've cleared an area of baddies that is lost in this game.  If nothing else, it makes more sense in a traditional FPS game, but not so much when the RPG elements are factored in.  Also, though the loot is abundant and exciting, it can also become a burden.  There are SO many weapons in this game that you tend to get tired of managing it.  Plus, no number of inventory slots can be enough, and I would encourage ponying up for the DLC that grants players a chest to store additional loot.  Lastly, the game seems intent on forcing you to progress at it's own pace.  Enemies that are more than one level above you are simply unkillable - entire clips of assault rifle ammo simply have no impact on their health.  But walk away, kill some random enemies or do some side-missions to gain a level or two, and vanquish these recently-invincible opponents like the proverbial hot knife through butter.  It's avoidable, however - check the difficulty rating through your \"ECHO\" mission screen.  Anything rated as \"hard\" or \"impossible\" is a simple indication that you need another level or two beneath your belt.  Likewise, you could team with a higher-level buddy, but this isn't as much fun.In closing, it's certainly a simple game.  The cartoonish graphics and blatant, slap-stick \"nuclear holocaust\" humor clearly emphasize the lack of maturity in this title.  But in the end it's good, simple, childish fun.  After hours of reading or watching dialogue in titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect 2, you might welcome the chance to just cut loose, grab some guns and blow stuff up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

Allen","summary":"Best multiplayer since.... cod4....","reviewText":"This game is like a clone of Call of Duty 4, only that it's set in World War 2. The multiplayer is similar as Call of Duty 4 in that you rank up to unlock weapons and peaks. I only played the multiplayer so I'll review that.Here are a list of positives and negatives:Pros:* You always find a full game on the PC* Ranking up is fairly easy and fun* Game's controls are a snap to master. Right click to aim, left click to fire, and the WASD combo to move. Easy to play.* Faster weapon switch. In Call of Duty 4, I had to press 1 to switch from Primary to Pistols. But in World at War, I got to do it by pressing the mouse wheel up by default. So overall the default keys are fairly good* Fun maps. The maps are unique and there is this game mode called \"War\" which is like capture the flag, but only fun. I am hooked on it.* Unique weapons. You get things like a flamethrower once you reach level 65 (the highest level). This weapon is awesome, but it's a bit hard to use since some servers will kick you if you use it too much.Cons:* XP server farms which gives you like 3000XP per kill so that you can go from rank 1 to like rank 65 in a manner of minutes* PunkBuster was a pain. I installed from Steam, so I don't know. I kept getting kicked for some PunkBSevB.exe or something. I had to download and install PunkBuster from the website. Didn't have this problem with Call of Duty 4, so I don't know.* Some weapons are unrealistic. I hate saying \"realism\" since what game is real? But the fact is that the game is based on World War 2 and yet you get some weird things like a red dot-like enhancements for your gun.* Some good weapons are missing. Like the Greese Gun which is quite fun to shoot.* The default \"V\" for knife key is a bit strange especially when you get in a tight corner.* Weapons hit detections a bit off it seems. When I use the M1 Garand, I don't know why but I can't really hit all that many things without dying a lot.* I have it on Steam, and after updating to the most recent version, I got no sounds on Vista until I modified my sound settings in Windows to a lower quality.* Getting it on steam also means if a server updates to a newer version, you might have to wait a few days as Valve gets the update to download.Overall I'm pleased with the game. I think the fun factor is all the way up there at 5, but the fact that there are a few loose ends especially with punkbuster and the sound patch, I gave the overall quality of this game a 4.

It \"scans\" your body at the start to project a real-time model of yourself into the game. I was eating a bowl of ice cream at the start and I could see my avatar holding the bowl of ice cream in the game. It doesn't scan/render my head/hair correctly though and I don't have a funky hairdo. The tracking is nearly accurate all the time, I only had a few instances where it didn't seem to register my movements correctly in Zen/Yoga and brick breaking.There are a lot of exercises in this game, some are broken down by difficulty and stages. There's even a personalized fitness program that recommends exercises based on what you want to achieve. You don't have to follow it, and can tailor it however you desire.The running and jump rope games seemed interesting at first, but they're essentially games that require you to run in place (lift knees higher for more speed) or jump in place (coordinate with the footprints on the screen). The stomp it had an interesting premise but I had to be really coordinated and the calorie burn rate was minimal.My favorite events are balancing a platform with boxes falling down  (strengthens core muscles), brick/wall breaking, cardio kickboxing, and Zen energy. Cardio kickboxing starts off slow but it builds you up quickly and the full-speed exercises are a lot of fun. I was definitely sweating big time after each event and have felt improvements in my core muscles, legs, and arms. The Zen Energy combines Yoga with Tai Chi. The really great part about Fitness Evolved 2012 is the computer trainer. She will make suggestions in real-time and provide audio/visual cues on what to do next. Games like Just Dance 4 and Zumba Fitness Core may provide visual cues but it's not always that useful. Fitness Evolved 2012 is not just about matching the movements, but doing the movements correctly with assistance and practice, as well as using calories as a performance metric.The core, abs, and other focused training events work exceptionally well. The crunches and other ab work that requires you to lie down on the floor somehow track accurately in Kinect. Although I do have a 8 foot space from the Kinect in my living room.There's quite a few pay-to-play DLC in this game, including one that requires you to buy a Gatorade G02 bottle to scan in order to unlock. I won't be buying any of the DLC or the Gatorade because the existing events are fine as-is. I didn't see anything that made me want to go out and spend Microsoft points or money to purchase.Remember to load the Kinect Playfit app for Xbox so you can get more achievements by burning calories, as Fitness Evolved 2012 is a compatible game.Overall: 5/5 stars, my favorite fitness game for Kinect with many fun and useful training exercises. Cardio kickboxing and Zen Energy are my favorites!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2013"}

Everything in this review is honest from my point of view. Add more games (especially free ones) and the rating will go up!The controller feels great. It is similar to the XBOX 360 controllers. It plugs in and pivots from the micro USB. I used it on my Nexus 7 tablet.Issues: does not work on 3rd party games unless you download the 3rd party Moga Universal Driver. Not crazy about putting a 3rd party app on phone just to use this for my SNES and NES emulator games. It's cheaper to get a bluetooth universal controller or a rechargeable USB controller and install the driver on the device from the actual manufacturer.The main issue is that there are not a lot of games with the Moga controller. The vast majority you have to buy, and they are either old games that likely have cheap licensing (I mean... Sonic CD for real???) or they're knock offs of more current games like the Grand Theft Auto clone. Regardless, you spend $50 on the controller and then have to buy games to play. Kind of a raw deal. Perhaps if it was loaded with a few more free games (real ones) and then the other games were cheaper? That would have been ideal.Also, buy some rechargeable AAA batteries so you don't lose your head with the dead battery syndrome.It more games come out for this then I might up the rating, but as of right now the selection is limited, the prices are high ($3-$5 is high in my opinion after buying the $50 device). Save your money and get an Android compatible universal controller, download a SNES emulator ($3-4) and get some ROMS. In the end it's cheaper.

It utilized a very cool 3-D effect that, when done right, really adds to the overall immersion of the gaming experiences available on it. Everything was an improvement on the original DS. Granted, it also had some caveats and issues as well. The 3DS XL does a very good job delivering the goodness of the original 3DS, while making vast improvements over its smaller brother original. In this review, I will focus on the differences and improvements this model makes on the 3DS line. I'll warn you right now, this is a long review. If you don't like long reviews, then you may want to skip this. :PScreen Size: With a title that includes \"XL,\" obviously the increase in size is the biggest difference between this and the original 3DS. It may be easy to hear that the screens are 90% bigger than the original, but it really is a stark difference when you take the system out of the package and see it for yourself. The XL's screens are HUGE compared to the original. It's comparable to the jump between the DSi and the DSXL, for those savvy to what that means, but in this case its even bigger because the top screen is in a widescreen format. Despite the size increase, the picture is still crisp and pops with nice detail. I thought that because the screen would be bigger, but with the same resolution as the original, the XL's picture would be distorted and fuzzy, but that's not the case here. I've put the screen detail and quality through rigorous testing since buying the system, playing many different games, and the bigger picture really makes the scenery more detailed than I ever noticed before. It's no exaggeration to say that the games actually feel new due to this greater detail. It's great!Screen quality: Instead of the top half of the XL having a shiny, glossy finish of the screen and the area around it that the original featured, the 3DSXL features an almost \"smoothed over\" finish that was meant to lessen glare from the sun or other lights from bothering your eyes. It actually makes quite a difference. The trade-off is that the back-lighting seems just a smidgen less bright, but not much at all. One of the biggest problems I had with the original 3DS was the problem of \"ghosting.\" It was especially frequent in games with areas of high contrast. This was a common issue people had with the original 3DS, but I haven't noticed it much at all yet with the XL. This is a big plus for me, because that ghosting was one of my biggest gripes with the original. I made my peace with it though, because ghosting naturally occurs from time to time with the tech being utilized in the 3DS, but to have it mostly gone here is a real treat. The colors in the XL seem brighter and a bit more vibrant as well. The touch screen is really nicely made, and seems to be a slight improvement on the original, but the difference is negligible. The saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" comes to mind.DS backwards compatibility: Honestly, this is one of the best things about the 3DXL. If you look up comparison videos of the first 3DS playing original DS games and a DSi playing DS games, the 3DS is surprisingly inferior. The colors are more bland, the resolution is fairly fuzzy, and if you choose to play it in its native resolution to fix that blurry smudginess, the screen becomes so small it's hardly worth doing that. The XL makes drastic improvements in all of these areas. The colors are just as bright and beautiful as playing on a normal DSiXL. Due to the larger screen size, playing in a native resolution still leaves ample room for playtime and is no longer the cramp experience the first 3DS offered. If you choose that route, the screen will be close to a normal DSi. Even if you don't, the picture is still decent at full-size, shockingly. This fantastic backwards compatibility is a real plus in the 3DSXL's favor and should not be understated. Massive improvement here.Build quality: Much like the new DSi and DSiXL made notable improvements in build quality to their predecessors, so does the XL refine the design of its predecessor. Instead of an outer glossy finish, there is a sleek matte exterior that makes the XL feel more heavy duty and refined. It definitely has a better build quality than the original. My original 3DS' top screen hinge became fairly loose and the lock-in positions a little weak after just one instance where I accidentally jostled it. The hinges on the XL click and lock into one or two set angular positions before locking into the flat position and I know there's no way this thing is going to break easily at all. That's a really nice improvement. The system is surprisingly slick in its form too. It's about the same thickness as the original (which is kind of clunky in comparison, let's be honest), and even weighs less than expected, despite the larger screen and button size, and this size and shape really comes across as a mature, sleek gadget from Nintendo. I felt the same way about their classy DSiXL system too. The buttons are also vastly improved. The home, select, and start buttons are actual separated buttons that have a bit of click to them, which is a vast improvement. The other buttons have more \"squish\" to them, but still click in a satisfying way. All-in-all, the buttons feel very balanced, if that make sense. They're very similar to the DSiXL's button quality, which is to say, very nice. The 3-D and Volume slider are also different. When all the way off, the 3-D slider clicks into position, and when you want to turn the 3-D effect on, you must click it out of position and then slide it to your desired position. Both the volume and 3-D sliders seem more heavy duty. They stick and stay in position very, very well. A lot of small details add up in this system, to be sure.Battery life: In my personal experience, the original 3DS had battery life that lasted about 4-5 hours with the 3-D slid up, 5-7 without 3-D, and roughly 6-8 hours with DS games. The 3DS XL is supposed to last 3.5-6.5 hours with 3D, 6-8 without, and 8-10 with DS games. It's not a HUGE improvement, but every bit counts. If you're like me and play a lot of the time with the system plugged into the wall, it won't really matter all that much anyway, but for those who want to play on the go, this is a really nice improvement over the original.Sound: Supposedly, the sound tech in the 3DSXL is pretty close to the original, but I (and others, I've checked) have noticed some differences. The speakers on the XL seem a bit quieter than the original. Not a ton, mind you, but it's noticeable. The speaker volume level seems to depend on which game you're playing too. 3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure seems just as loud as before, but better now. I tend to play my 3DS with theseamazing headphoneson, and the difference becomes really noticeable then. The sound from the XL with headphones seems a lot more detailed and ambient than before, and the volume level is fine. The highs, mids, and lows are distinctive with no aspect overpowering or distorting the others. Much like the visuals, I'm hearing things in games I never heard before, and it has enhanced my experience even further. Great stuff here, and a very pleasant surprise!Memory: The 3DSXL comes with a 4 GB SD card, making for a much bigger space for storage than the 2 GB SD card included with the first models. This is nice. I almost filled my first one up and still had a lot more games to get. Granted, you can buy any sized SD to use with the 3DS after some formatting, but having more space right off the bat is nice.Any issues?: In many ways, the 3DSXL is what the 3DS should have been from the beginning, and it's a fantastic little handheld. It's not quite perfect though. For one, where's the second analog slider? There's ample room under the right-hand face buttons for it, but alas, no slider. It's not a problem that bothers me much, but I must note it because there are many who will view it as an issue. Imagining the boat-peripheral they're making for this system makes me giggle a bit. It conjures up visions of Nintendo releasing a laptop-sized 3DS with trigger buttons, lol. I understand they kept it out due to tech/power/space optimization, which makes sense. Personally, I never cared much for a second slider, and not having one has pushed developers to come up with some really creative things in the past on the DS and 3DS alike. I also find the design of the XL to be, like the original, cramped and painful to hold after a while, especially in high-action games. It's definitely better, don't get me wrong, but the cramping is still there a bit. I am waiting for CTA-Digital to release a Sega Saturn-esque hand grip for the system. :D Perhaps the most annoying thing about this handheld is the d-pad. It works just as well as the one before, but now it's extremely \"clicky.\" I don't mean the button clicks when you use it; that has always been the case with the 3DS. What I mean is, now the d-pad seems to be looser in its area, and so makes this \"clickety\" sound against the bracket if you lift your thumb off of it even if only for a split-second. It can be really annoying. One more personal gripe: the color choices. Really Nintendo? Bright blue and red? The DSiXL had really mature, fetching color options that made the system feel like an adult's gadget. These slick red and blue colors are a lot less subtle and elegant. Don't get me wrong, I own a teal 3DS (not exactly the most \"mature\" color choice) and love it, but I wish there had been a more subdued teal, gold, or forest/jade green finish to choose from. Just you wait, as soon as I post this review, that option will become available, knowing my luck. lolI realize this review is very long, but when considering tech purchases that are this pricey, these kind of reviews always helped me make informed decisions better. I have both the original and now the XL, and I must say the 3DSXL feels like the \"true\" 3DS. The system should have been like this from the start, honestly, and when it was originally announced, I, along with many others, hoped for an XL edition. Now we get it and it has been well worth the wait. For those who don't own a 3DS yet, this is the perfect time to get it. This system finally delivers on the promise of the original 3DS, and now there's an excellent library of titles for newcomers to joyously embrace. At a mere 30$ more than the original for practically double the space and a big jump in hardware quality, it's more than worth it. This is a great value. I'm glad I got the original a year ago, but I am absolutely thrilled to get this version, and heartily recommend it to all gamers with a heart container for Nintendo. It's not a choice you'll regret.  I hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful. Have a good day. Toodles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

I dont agree with sonys decision to price thease memory cards at such a steep price, however, if you like to play video games then you dont have a choice but to deal with it and pay the price for the entertainment that you are seeking.

Sony isnt going to lower prices anytime soon so If you have the money and are interested in buying this handheld then buy it, it's a high quality product thats worth the money, and you wont regret your purchase, if not then, consider getting a 3ds if you dont already have one it's cheaper ( $169.99) and it doesn't require a memory card. Now my review about this memory card. 16gigs is excellent enough for game saves and depending on how much content you download, it can hold a fair amount of content, but most likely a bigger card will eventualy need to be purchased if you download alot of content. But if you only need a memory card for game saves only then this card will last awhile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006ZPAYD2","description":"","reviewerName":"James Donnelly \"Ave Atque Vale\"","summary":"A FANTASTIC time for kids of all ages!","reviewText":"When I got my first Lego-based game, the original STAR WARS game, I fell in love with the series. It was so simple, but done with such excellent and incredibly fun execution that you couldn't help but fall in love with it. It was a game that would appeal to children easily, and perhaps adults even more easily recreating your favorite scenes of the films. This followed suit with the Lego INDIANA JONES TRILOGY (Not the \"Complete Adventures\", because I still wanted nothing to do with CRYSTAL SKULL). When the first LEGO BATMAN came out, I was ecstatic and I played it until my fingers were ready to fall off. My favorite comic character of all time had a Lego game. It was probably my favorite of the Lego series that I had played.Until LEGO BATMAN 2: DC SUPER HEROES came out, that is.I have been playing this game with a greater fervor than any of the previous games combined. The biggest plus for me regarding this game is the much more open world-ness of the game. It feels like a much bigger game, and it certainly is in regards to character, story, and graphics. The main story is very much like the older and sillier team-up comic books in which the best villains combine forces to wreak havoc on their respective heroes, which is what brings together Batman, Robin and Superman vs The Joker and Lex Luthor. Of course, all of the inmates of Arkham escape as well, so you're up against many of the villains of the first game as well, such as Two-Face, Harley Quinn, The Penguin, Catwoman, etc. But this isn't just those three characters as the heroes. As you go deeper into the story gameplay, you get the most of the current lineup of the Justice League (Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, and Cyborg)!You still have the constant pumping of Danny Elfman's iconic score from the 1989 Batman film, but nicely, when you're in the open world scenarios, if you choose to fly with Superman, you get the even more iconic John Williams Superman theme! As far as sound design is concerned, this is the first time that you're treated to actual dialogue in a Lego game, and again, the dialogue is aimed at kids, but for an all-ages game, the dialogue fits these characters very well and particularly the newscasts during the cutscenes are very clever with the scroll at the bottom of the screen, which is something the adults will get a big kick out of. The sound effects are terrific, and you even have Clancy Brown returning to voice Lex Luthor as he did in the SUPERMAN and JUSTICE LEAGUE animated series (Sadly, no Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy or Tim Daly though).The biggest attraction for me personally was the amazing list of unlockable characters. Characters like Aquaman, Hush, Ra's al Ghul, Hawkman and many, many more are hiding around town waiting for you to build the golden door so that when you do get to the free play modes, you can pick and choose without always having to rely on the suits. Also, the DLC for this game (which includes packs of five heroes/villains a piece) is VERY inexpensive and is really there for the big comic fans.There are some nitpicky problems that I have with the game (I wish that Green Lantern could shoot projectiles from his ring; I wish The Flash could run straight up buildings... like I stated, nitpicky), but the only problem I have with the game play is the flight mechanics are a little clumsy during the open-world segments, and that's a pretty minor problem. I know that many people who play co-op are having some problems with the in-game camera co-op play, but since I don't even have another controller, it's honestly not something I could comment on. Ideally these games are designed to play with another person so that they can join in the fun, but I'm more of a solo player anyway so it's never been a concern. Although my wife has expressed interest in playing this game with me as we did together with the first Lego Batman, so I might be looking for another controller soon!For right now though, LEGO BATMAN 2 is one fantastically entertaining game filled with action, humor and joy and if you're a fan of the previous games, this should be a really easy buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}

If your PC barely meets the minimum speculations, forget about this game until you have a new computer.SingleplayerThe singleplayer in Crysis is the products main feature. It takes about 12 - 15 hours depending on the difficulty of play. The singleplayer is highly replayable because of the open level design. Crysis looks to set itself apart by its level design. You are not hauled down one hallway or specific path in this game, instead you are thrown into a sandbox where you can approach your objective as you see fit.Another thing I like is the fact that the weapons are customizable. You can attach scopes, silencers, grenade launchers, lazer sights, flashlights, and even use differt types of amnunition. I ended up turning each of my weapons into somewhat of a sniper rifle, picking off soldiers at a distance.The nanosuit is also a neat mechanic of the game. It has the settings of armor (soaks up damage from enemies), cloak (makes you invisible), speed (the use of this is obvious), and strength (allows super high jumps, super damaging punches, my personal favorite: throwing random things into enemys, or even picking them up). It further allows you to play the way you wish.Finally, the AI in this game is quite good. They know how to use cover, and take cover when being shot at. They try also to outmanuver you. Though sometimes there are problems, overall the AI is good.MultiplayerIf you are buying Crysis for the multiplayer, buy Crysis: Warhead instead. The multiplayer has only five maps, and while it is very fun. It seems hindered by the small amount of maps. Crysis: Warhead, on the other hand has 26 maps, but its singleplayer is disappointing. It comes down to what you want in a game.Graphics - 10/10Gameplay - 10/10Sound - 8/10Multiplayer - 8/10Value - 9/10OVERALL - 9.5/10 - Outstanding","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}

Throw in some cute characters, cool bosses, three different vehicles, huge racing courses and some sweet secrets and you've got yourself an awesome game, right? Well...yes and no.I loved this game when I was a kid. Diddy Kong Racing was the first game I bought for the N64 (in fact, it was the reason I purchased an N64). I played this non-stop then, beating the entire game, unlocking all the secrets, then beating the whole game again. Then I moved onto different games, and DKR fell by the wayside.So, a few days ago, I decided to pop it in, for the nostalgia factor (and also to see if it was still any fun). I started a new game, and found the first track. So far, I was having fun, probably due to the nostalgia, but so far so good. Then I got into my first race. I was greeted by horrible controls- it felt like my character was sliding along on ice. I managed to finish the race in first place, soundly beating my CPU opponents, even with the controls. I thought to myself &quot;This isn't how I remember DKR...maybe I'll play some more.&quot; So, I play for a few more hours, beating the world and the level boss. The controls have gotten slightly better, but are still very loose. The cheesy music is grating on my nerves, as are the annoying super-cutesy characters. I finally turn the game off, deciding too let my fond memories of the game remain intact.In 1997, Diddy Kong Racing was revolutionary. Today, it stands as a failed idea. Still, I hope that some developer can take the basic idea of DKR and craft a decent kart racer around it. I really like the adventure game aspects of DKR; but the poor multiplayer and the loose controls are huge turn-offs. Ultimately, you'd be better off buying Mario Kart 64 if you need a racing game for your N64. I give DKR points for originality; it's just that the execution is way off the mark.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2004"}

This handy little kit makes DVD playback a snap. All one has to do is pop the sensor unit in to one of the controller ports (Port One seems to work best) and fire up the remote. The remote's design is user-friendly, with big buttons and an ergonomic design that fits nicely into one's hand. Among the features offered on the Xbox (accessed by pressing the display button) are 10X magnification, subtitles, and audio selection.But the remote has a downside, as well. Its range is a little limited (go too far to the left or right of the sensor and functionality becomes a little spotty), and it lacks a power or eject button. Plus, it requires you use the display button to access too many functions--this can be a bit of a hassle, as many other DVD players offer remotes with these functions already available through a single button. It also plays Region One DVDs only, so DVDs from Europe (or other regions) won't play. Then there's the matter of the additional wear and tear DVD playback has on the Xbox unit itself. If you play a lot of games and watch a lot of DVDs, you may end up shortening the life of your Xbox system. With DVD players going for as little as forty to fifty dollars these days, it may be wiser to just buy a separate DVD player. But if you want to utilize the DVD functions of the Xbox system, then this little package will serve the purpose well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2003"}

But this one has yet to strike my fancy. I pick it up and play longer than I care to, hoping I'll begin to see what everyone else is crazy about where this game is concerned; but I've yet to take a liking to it. It is certainly an RPG. You'll do lots of talking to random people (catching small glimpses of the grander story unfolding), improving your abilities, and adventuring in general. But the graphics leave quite a bit to be desired, there's a LOT of reading to be done here, most of the characters fail to be interesting, and the majority of tasks I've been hit with have been bland or felt tedious. The controls handle pretty decently and the soundtrack is better than some (it hasn't grown to be annoying yet, at least). All in all, this game doesn't break new ground or even push the envelope further than other games already have. I feel like I'm still playing Ocarina. Most people have no problem with that. And I'm sure that's why the ratings for this game are as good as they are. But my expectations for this game were much higher than they should have been. The further you go into this experience, the better it's going to get. So if you play it long enough, you'll start getting more of the action you long for. But it could be better in almost all aspects. So I'm rating the game what I feel it ends up being; 3 stars. Rent it first. For, as you can probably tell by looking at other reviews, my opinion isn't everyone's. But it is my hope that an honest opinion, such as this is, does not go unappreciated. You may find that this is the greatest game ever made.

Viking may not have much story, it may be repetitive sometimes, and the graphics may not outdo every game out there, but it's just fun! The story is something about a Viking clan battling the Legion over who gets Asgard. While the story fills you in here and there it's confusing, and pointless. The game consists of lots of hacking and slashing, and Viking takes this literally. You can lop off heads, slice torsos in half etc all in detailed gore. The levels you explore are HUGE and thanks to the \"Leystone\" warp system it makes things easier. While you travel around the 3 huge islands you discover these Leystones and they let you warp about.The game is built around missions that are easily located on your map so you'll NEVER get lost, yet gives you the challenge to find the right hidden paths. Some missions have you sneaking into places (it works), and you can perform stealth kills (more on the upgrade system soon) to sneak in quietly. What I loved was that you never get lost sneaking into these HUGE bases so trial and error doesn't exist. The paths are easily laid out for you, but you have to search to find them. This is just another reason of how well balanced this whole game is.You also have a magic system which lets you charge up your sword with either fire, ice, or lightning and you can lay waste to foes with this. I, personally, never used these much because the regular hits do just fine. You can use throwing axes, fire pots, and I also played through the WHOLE game without using one single healing potion. This doesn't mean the game is easy it's just that the game is so forgiving about checkpoints and the Leystone system just works so well. The best part about this game are the large scale battles. When you've gathered enough forces to raid each fort you engage battles with thousands of people on screen and you also have dragons helping you. This is where some RTS gameplay comes in. You have to kill Shamans in order to advance to the next part of the fort. You get \"Rune stones\" by killing enemies in red so your dragons can take out enemies.Each type of enemy requires a certain number of rune stones. This makes the battles both easier, and more interesting. This game does have many faults. There is slow down in places you wouldn't expect, and the framerate drops in the single digits. I felt like I was playing on an old computer sometimes. While the combat system is good it's missing a dodge button. All of the abilities you learn are well balanced, but some can't be performed right due to enemy cheap shots.The graphics are nice, but are repeated over and over and aren't anything unique. The sound is pretty scarce (GS did get that right). There is only good music during massive battles. The game is pretty short closing in on 10 hours. I also can't help but mention that the game felt like parts of other games. The exploration felt like Oblivion while the combat felt like Lord of the Rings and certain \"button sequences\" were ripped straight from God of War. These aspects are welcome but aren't done as well as said games. This game is a great weekend rental, but nothing more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Beiler \"cool person\"","summary":"its fun even with turned base action","reviewText":"i never thought id like a turned base action game but this game is a load of fun.  the graphics may not be the best but the plot is good and theres always something to do.going around buying stuff and talking to people can be just as fun as the battleing parts.  well you can either catch moonfish which gives you items or take on a bounty or just fly around in your ship looking for a fight.  Its a very long RPG too it will take over 30 hours to beat so you better be ready.overall the sound is all right and the camera views can be kinda annoying but no big deal. if you have a gamecube and you like RPGs ill reccomend to you or just to anyone who has a gamecube.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1QY","description":"Nintendo certainly has added a quirky spin on the old English game withMario Tennis. With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.  Lobs, smashes, and cross-court shots are among the options.Mario Tennis 64 taps the controlled challenge of real-life tennis, and intertwines light-hearted graphics with good game play.  A 2000 Parents' Choice&#174; Approved winner.Reviewed by Jason R. Rich, Parents' Choice&#174; 2000--FromParents' Choice&#174;","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Still fun even though it is a decade old.","reviewText":"I got it for free on the Wii Virtual Console (using Club Nintendo points) and this turned out to be one of Mario's best sport games beside Mario Kart and Mario Super Sluggers. The characters each have unique abilities and advantages. Bowser hit the ball so hard that it hit Mario in the head and caused him to lose the match, while Baby Mario was very tricky and fast. The graphics aren't bad if you don't mind the Nintendo 64's outdated hardware. The controls are VERY EASY, and it is nice break to go back to joysticks and A buttons in the Wii/Kinect generation. The game has a lot of options. You can enter a tournament, or play a quick round. Up to 4 people can play, and one option was to use items like in Mario Kart. No Nintendo 64 or Wii will ever be complete without this game. It has a lot of charm and excitment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"Only Average","reviewText":"I was pretty excited about getting Godzilla unleashed and while it is maringally fun it didn't live up to expectations.  My son and I were able to finish the game with unexpected ease and in little time.  Yes, you never want a game where the game play is monotonously tedious but you also don't want to finish in a couple of hours after paying $50 or $60 either.The game basically combines elements of the old Rampage video game as well as fighting games and tosses in some rather weak story features.  The story involves aliens causing disasters and monsters to raise havoc by dropping somce crystals all over the earth.  It's somewhat confusing at first on just what you are supposed to do in story mode.  Are you supposed to destroy buildings?  Destroy the Crystals?  fight with other monsters?  We got the hang of it fairly quickly but it was a bit dicey at first.  You get Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan, and there are villains such as Destroyah, Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, etc...By earning points in the story mode you unlock other playable monsters and playable city settings.  You get only three settings to start with.I wasn't all the crazy about the story mode.  I liked some of the other modes where you can battle against another monster in a one-on-one battle, or tou have a destruction mode where you battle to see who can earn the most points by destroying the city before the timer runs out.The controls I though were a bit too loose.  I'ts not easy pulling off some of the more complicated moves and thus you end up doing just a lot of kicking and punching which gets boring after awhile.  The various special powers like Godzilla's atomic breath are cool but I found it a bit hard to aim the blast with the Wii controllers.The graphics and sounds are one of the better parts of the game.  The graphics are sharp and the monsters a rendered perfectly and sound just like the movie versions.A fun game but not one that i will play now that it's finished","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2008"}
