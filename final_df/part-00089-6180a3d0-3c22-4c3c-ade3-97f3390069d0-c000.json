It ruins whatever else maybe good about it. Its a RPG for Dummies, with half baked \"moral\" dilemas that everyone raves about, seen them, played them in much better packages, not exactly ground breaking. If you think Fable was a great game, this one will make you happy..If you prefer games like Planescape Torment, I would avoid it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"L.A. Noire Review","reviewText":"LA Noire is from RockStar and Team Bondi. It puts you into the shoes of a cop of the rise named Cole Phelps. You'll get the chance to solve case for multiple different departments within the LAPD. You'll find yourself in the Traffic division, Homicide, VICE, and Arson. You'll have to track down all the clues and get your witnesses and suspects to tell you exactly what you need to do. If you can accomplish all of this you might find yourself as one of the best in LA.Graphically this game starts off stunning. The lay out of the city looks spot on, the characters that you'll interact with will have you constantly thinking, haven't I seen that face before, somewhere else? There's also the long list of vehicles that you'll have at your disposal. The one thing that is revolutionary is the face tracking technology, and you're going to have to use it if you're going to be able to find out what you need to know. The odd thing though is that as you play the game the graphics actually seem to decay. You'll noice more and more texture pop as you go on, and the characters also seem to decline in appearance. I noticed near the end of the game that several of the characters' mouths will appear to be melting.The music of the game definitely gives you that 1940's vibe. The voice acting really sells the story when you couple it with the faces that you'll be encountering.The controls are for the most part easy to pick up and will be your best friend. There are some issues when you're trying to get in and out of cover with the shoulder button, but other than that you'll find that you won't have too many issues with your controls.As stated before you're a cop in 1947 name Cole Phelps. You'll get your chance to show that you're a star pretty quick off the bat, and as you continue to complete cases you might just get those promotions. There's a set number of cases for each division and you'll be ranked on how well you collected all the clues, got the correct answers, and caused minimal damage to cars, the city, and individuals walking the city. You'll also find that there are other crimes that you'll pick up on over the radio, and you can choose to complete those as well. The better you do with the questioning and taking on the street crimes the higher you'll rank up. As you rank up you'll have access to other suits, and you'll also get rewarded with Intuition Points that you can use to either remove wrong answers from your interrogation or you can pool the audience (if you're connected to XBL) to see what the most popular choices are.You'll find that this story will keep you pretty glued to your seat. I did have some issues with the VICE cases as I didn't really find them nearly as enjoyable as the Homicide cases, but the overall layout of the story, filled with twists, definitely kept bringing me back to this game.If you're looking to a Hard-Crime game in which you can sink your teeth into, then this is the game for you. If you're looking for a GTA type of game in which you play a cop, you might be slightly depressed as you won't be able to draw your weapon unless its a time for a gun fight. This game, even when the graphics starts to go, is something that you need to get. This game gets an 8.7 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

After successful Mario Kart games on the SNES,N64,GBA,GC the beloved franchise made its entry on the Nintendo DS in late 2005.Much like the other Mario Kart titles it would achieve total success that it can now be talked about as one of the better DS titles.The game ain't new to anyone who's played any Mario Kart game,its still pick your character, the difficulty, the courses and vehicles and you're ready to go.Let's make it clear:this is a racing game,this ain't Mario in another adventure.The Mario Kart series are some the greatest racing games as they are really fun and they aren't your average racing game.If you think playing Mario characters in some race cars and use weapons such as head searching shells,it is guaranteed you will love this game.There are different classes in the game.Each character has his own class for example Mario is Normal while Toad is light and Bowser is heavy,at least that's what it was in other games.Yet it doesn't affect the game that much except light characters can go faster while heavier ones can bump you really hard.Its nice to have such differences in the game.Mario Kart DS doesn't disappoint at all,in fact its one of the most satisfying DS games you'll ever play.A thing that helps make the game so good is the replayability factor which is really good as there is a lot on this game to keep you entertained for years to come.The Grand Prix mode is classic,you compete in four races while trying to get the best position possible from 1-8,with 1 being best and 8 being the worst.Each position will earn you different amount of points,get as most point as you can,that way you can earn trophies.There is also the battle mode,Balloon Battle is where everybody has three balloons and try to pop everyone's balloons to win.Then there is also in battle mode Shine Runners,where you try to get as many stars as you can and even steal the opposition's stars.Other thing is Time Trials where you try make the fastest lap and time,you will have to defeat your best record's ghost.Another mode is VS where you pick a map and race against computers.The new mode here is Missions where you have to complete missions and beat bosses(while still in your car). I found that new mode quite interesting and the boss battles are really great!If you have the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection you will be able to race against other DS and Mario Kart owners wich is a pretty fun option.It doesn't really add anything new but playing with your friends or other peoples is pretty cool.The only \"bad\" thing is that Nintendo didn't make full use of the DS's capacities.The stylus is not used to race,and the mic doesn't do anything at all,so on the control side it could have been better but the buttons feel alright to play with.The stylus is used to travel throughout menus and to draw you custom logo,which you can have on your car if you want,the mic however is not used at all.As I said earlier in this review this game is great because of its replayablility.With all the modes it has it will make play it for a while.Also there are a lots of unlockables such as new Grand Prix,characters(there are new characters in it!) and a ton of different vehicles for each characters.Waluigi was added as a new character,Dry Bones is also new to the franchise and he's probably the best character in the game.The other new character is Rob,a robot who's pretty bizarre and doesn't really fit the game at all but it's a new character so we'll take it I suppose.Add to all that,the maps are designed very well and are very creative,with beautiful graphics for the DS.As simple as it sounds Mario Kart DS is enormously entertaining and worth the tag price. After all that time it still is one of the games i play most for my DS.If you are a fan of Mario,racing or you have a Nintendo DS this an essential title to your collection. I give it the highest rating possible it really is that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

This time around, bugs are fairly few and far between (unlike \"Daggerfall,\" which was one of the buggiest games ever made), but the experience suffers from a few significant, if not at all crucial, faults.The Elder Scrolls series has always had one thing above all else in its favor: depth. \"Morrowind\" is no exception, though it somehow feels shallower than \"Arena.\" To anyone unfamiliar with the series at large, though, the world may appear so vast that, initially, it's downright confounding. Without the official Bethesda guide, you stand no chance whatsoever of discovering everything that the game has to offer, and even then you may miss a few things here and there. I dare say the developers themselves could be surprised every now and again if you were to set them down in front of the game. It's so huge you have to see it to believe it. Freedom is the name of this particular game, and you are limited only by Morrowind's surrounding seas and your own statistics. If you want a game to last you a year or more, even if you play it constantly, then \"Morrowind\" is the one to get.However, despite all of its successes, \"Morrowind\" has its fair share of problems - especially if, like me, you are an avid fan of the series, and have been playing it these past ten years. For starters, though the game's graphics are generally excellent, the whole province of Morrowind is lacking in diversity. Many of the game's villages and cities look much like one another in all but their layout (with a few exceptions), and even the game's dungeons are difficult to distinguish from one another. To make matters worse, there are few vivid colors. Everything has a drab, washed out look to it, which further subdues any variety in the scenery. The more one plays, the more annoying this becomes - particularly if you're an Elder Scrolls vet. I miss the varied landscapes of \"Arena\" and even \"Daggerfall.\" I miss traversing the marshlands and deserts and snowscapes of Tamriel, and delighting in that variety. \"Morrowind\" just sticks you in one dusty province and leaves you there. The weather effects do provide some nice ambience, but don't expect to see the seasons change in the \"Arena\" or \"Daggerfall\" mold. You may have just as much freedom to roam, but it's not as exciting as it used to be.A tighter main storyline would certainly have helped the game to gel a little better. There is very little story to speak of here, and too often you will find yourself playing errand boy instead of adventurer. Personally, I would rather the main story's quests involve more combat and less banter with NPCs - and I would certainly rather not spend as much of the game running from point A all the way to point B, which may or may not be half-way across the province. On top of that, most of what you will find between point A and point B is predictable, and leaves little room for excitement, or the thrill of discovery which was so prevalent in the earlier Elder Scrolls games. And why do you have to READ all the text in a modern PC game? I understand that if an actor were hired to voice every NPC in the game, the game would never be finished, given the extent and variety of the stuff, but there is no reason why pivotal characters in the main quest should not be voiced. That would make the story more compelling, certainly - because I don't play PC games to read thousands upon thousands of words of text. If I wanted that, I would go buy a novel. If \"Knights of the Old Republic\" can voice virtually every character in the game, then \"Morrowind\" can certainly voice its primary players.The real fun to be had in \"Morrowind,\" oddly enough, does not come from completing the primary storyline (which is not even required). No, the real fun comes from joining guilds and performing quests for them as you rise in their ranks - or from doing your very own thing. If you want to simply wander the province, explore dungeons, and kill lots and lots of monsters, you can do that, and it's quite fun. The combat is not very involved, but some of the more powerful and well-modeled enemies will certainly give you a thrill. Besides that, there is more than enough loot in Morrowind to satisfy any would-be treasure hunter. If you're looking for a fantasy roleplaying game that's all about a tight, cinematic story, you had better look elsewhere. If it's freedom you crave, then you'll have it with \"Morrowind.\" You can even become a vampire and stalk the living. How is that for freedom?All in all, \"Morrowind\" is a fantastic game, though it can sometimes feel more like work than play. Still, it does not hold a candle to \"Arena,\" though its predecessor is nearly ten years old - but few roleplaying games do, to be quite honest. For all its disappointments, \"Morrowind\" is certainly worth the effort, and will provide a nice escape from the mundane.Final Score: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2003"}

If you can think of something you'd like to do in Morrowind, chances are there's a way to do it.  Jump from a rain barrel to a rooftop to escape pursuing guards.  Poke around in the bushes outside of town and discover a hidden crypt filled with ghouls.  Paddle out into the ocean, fire an arrow at a giant jellyfish, and high-tail it back into town so the militia will protect you.  There is a lot of fun to be had in this entirely 3-D world.  That said, of course, there are some rather serious bugs that still haven't been corrected.1)  The most egregious I've encountered is the disappearing item bug.  Basically things in your inventory simply vanish.  Sometimes it's so minor you never notice.  Other times, it's a gem worth 15,000 gold.  Then, you notice.  At first I just assumed my naive 20th level guy was just a constant victim of pickpockets.  Then the suit of chainmail he was _wearing_ simply vanished while he was walking down the middle of an empty road.  I reversed course back into town and tried to buy another one from the local guard.  Since I had joined the Imperial Legion, no one would talk to me since I was now \"out of uniform.\"  Finally I found a non-Legion shop that carried Legion chainmail, bought a suit, and put it on.  The game crashed.  Reloaded, tried again.  Game crashed again.  Finally I just gave up on either being in the Legion, or ever having a Legionnaire NPC ever talk to me again (still out of uniform).2)  Ranged combat is bizarre.  For anyone used to 1st person shooters, using a bow and arrow and crosshairs to peg a target shouldn't be too challenging, but it still requires some coordination and timing, particularly when that target is trying to sneak up and kill you.  However, it's not enough to simply line up something with your bow and shoot it.  You have to ALSO \"hit\" it with your stats.  So if your character is bad with a bow, you can fire longbow arrows directly through people's heads on screen and not hit them.  Doesn't matter how big and lumbering the target is, if your stats say you miss, you miss, even if you see that arrow go right through its chest.3)  If you start the game and just barter with the first shopkeeper you find for about an hour, you'll soon be able to turn a huge profit just selling him back the items you buy from him.  So whenever you need money, you can just swap the same expensive item back and forth a few times to clean out the house.  Then you can use the money to just train yourself up levels.4)  Unpredictable NPCs.  A lot of the time, fairly innocent things will turn NPCs aggressive.  On the plus side, the guards will usually let you go with a minor fee/bribe, but it can get annoying fast, particularly when all the NPCs are \"linked\" so that if you [irritate] one, someone on the other side of town somehow magically senses it and runs over with their axe.  A classic example is opening a chest 3 floors above any NPC, then heading downstairs into a swirling pack of angry people.  Then when you kill them all, you're the bad guy, heh.All in all, it's a visually stunning game that can prove to be very frustrating in play.  I find I can only take it for an hour or two at a time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2003"}

You could very much enjoy the whole 10 chapters of the game for the first play-through. The glaive is a unique weapon, especially with the Aftertouch power, which could be controled by using SIXAXIS function. The special powers and upgrades are fun to use. The difficulty is just right, plenty of ammo. The gameplay succesfully manages to keep player interested by gradually bringing in new stuff along the way throughout the entire game.But that is all. The only unlockable you get after finishing the game is Brutal Mode. Aside from no new stuff, upgraded weapons and money don't carry over to the next game. Money is scarce, you could only upgrade or buy a few guns in one playthrough. The powerful guns become available late in the game, which means you have to save up from the first chapters if you want to try them, or start playing over again from the beginning if you already spent all you money. And once you applied an upgrade item on the gun, it's permanent and you couldn't check the effectiveness of each upgrade to the specific gun. If you applied the upgrade and you don't like it, the only options are sell that gun and buy a new blank gun or restart checkpoint.In conclusion, this game could give you a fun experience.

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"H.

{"product_name":"B0053BCML6","description":"","reviewerName":"ChibiNeko \"Sooo many books, so little time!\"","summary":"Nice additions, same gameplay","reviewText":"I'm kind of torn about deducting a star fun-wise for the repetitiveness of the game play for Animal Crossing: New Leaf. You have a lot of new additions here, but ultimately the gaming is still the same as all of its previous incarnations. This sort of frustrates me, as even the new additions necessitate the same things that I both loved and hated about the other versions of this game.However, I am still giving this game a five star overall rating. Not only is it one of the most kid-friendly games out on the market, but it's also one that adults can easily sit down and get into. It's very user-friendly and even if you're clumsy when it comes to controls, you can play this with little to no trouble.Some of the new additions are pretty nifty. Obviously being a mayor is cool, as you get to issue new ordinances for the town, such as ordering stores and villagers to stay open later. This will be great for those who are usually up later and get irritated that they have to find a way to store their bugs and fish until the next day. Oh, and that's one of the other things I like here. You can now store your bugs and fish in your closets, making it easier to collect them and store them without cluttering up your house.One of the things I've used the most has to be the \"best friend\" message function. You can link to other players and list them as friends, helping to show when others are online. This is something that you had to some extent in previous versions, but NL gives us the ability to IM our friends when they're online. You have to designate them as a best friend and turn on your IM function, but this is nice when you might want to swap short messages with someone while you're playing. Character space is limited so it's like using Twitter with half of the message space, but it's still pretty awesome. You can message one friend or all of them, which is nice.There's a spot pass function here as well that allows you to see other people's houses, although I'll admit that I haven't really found a way to use this function all that much. I haven't run into anyone that plays this game other than my friends, which sort of limits the cool factor of running into random people and seeing their stuff. I'll probably run into someone eventually, but for people who aren't in big areas with tons of people this will probably be one of the least satisfying parts of the game. I know it is for me so far.Other than that, I rather like how this works. I like that much of the town is unbuilt, waiting for me to accomplish certain tasks before they open up. It's frustrating, but still gratifying when I see construction start up. I do have to say that the island is nice for the most part, mostly because you can really rack up the bells while you're there, enabling you to pay off things a little more quickly so you can work through your home quickly so you can save your bells for the pricey extras such as the town projects or uber expensive house fixings.On a side note, skip the gaming guide for this and go to one of the various fan sites for this. The game guide has multiple issues and isn't really worth the price of admission.UPDATE:I'm updating this since I've been playing it for a few weeks now. I have to say that although I like some of the new additions, this is pretty much the same game that you've been playing all along. I know, some of you will roll your eyes and say \"of course it is!\", but this sort of cements that this game will appeal most to users that are either new to the series or are big fans of it. The new additions are nice, such as the construction and (yay) the ability to actually work in Brewster's coffee shop. Although there is kind of the edge of \"been there, done that\" to all of this.Oh, and I also have to say that the grass is a lot better in this version. In City Folk many users were highly irritated to discover that the grass wore away insanely quickly regardless of whether you walked or ran. That's still a factor here, although it doesn't wear away nearly as fast. Of course, if the AC people had really paid attention to what their playerbase was saying, they'd have known that we didn't want the grass to disappear at all and would rather that this element had been removed entirely... I'm slightly irritated that they kept this in the game. If realism was really a factor in this game we wanted, then we'd have asked for the ability to feed or starve our characters ala The Sims.But overall still a fun enough game and my opinion overall is still favorable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

As was the problem in earlier days with the laser-guided Genesis and PlayStation consoles, the GameCue is not totally reliable after some time goes by.  For me, that time amounted to 12 months - August 2004 to August 2005.  The console simply stopped working.When I contacted Nintendo of America (NOA), they said that there is no warranty for the piece - again, only 12 months out.  I had spent $150 for mine.  Their customerr service fix was for me to (A) keep the broken console and (B) buy a refurbished unit from them for $35 (I talked them down from $50).  The refurbshed unit I purchased lacked certain capabilities than my broken one, such as the networking capability.  (I wasn't going to use that feature anyway, but NOA told me that is why my original unit cost so much - added features.)So after a lot of bull crap, my Nintendo GameCube experience cost me a little under $200 for the hardware.  Worse is that the games turned out to be lame - Nintendo has forced some multiplayer games to require GameBoy Advances to be plugged in as controllers - another $150 each and even harder to use than a $25 controller; the only benefit is a worthless screen in the middle.My recommendation is to stay away from the Nintendo GameCube at all costs.  With all the mark-ups and add-on products, it is clear that the console is not worth the money you would pay for it.  Nintendo wants each of us to spend $500 on their console and a few games, which is ridiculous, especially given the faulty construction and lack of customer support.My recommendation is to stick with PC games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2007"}
{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Ayers","summary":"Does Alice make a smooth  jump to next-gen consoles?","reviewText":"From my blog: Buckeye829 reviews:It's been eleven years since Alice Liddell began her descent into her deranged Wonderland, in American McGee's Alice, which had earned quite a cult following.  Now, haunted by the death of her family in a tragic fire, that only she escaped, Alice travels to Wonderland once again in Alice: Madness Returns (EA, Spicy Horse Games).  After her release from Rutledge Asylum, Alice still maintains quite a bit of guilt and confusion about the calamitous incident that has turned her life upside down.  Regular sessions with her psychiatrist using hypnosis, seem to be having adverse effects on her thoughts and dreams.  As in the past, Alice retreats to Wonderland to escape, but finds it has drastically changed since her last visit.  Will she be able to unearth the secrets and clues that have led to her \"Madness?\"  Do the vibrant atmospheres exceed the gameplay?While technically labeled an action-adventure title, Alice: Madness Returns is basically a 3-D platformer with slight bits of combat thrown in.  Alice has a host of people concerned about her, but who are her friends and who are out to harm her?  Additionally, the familiar cast of characters return, but in limited roles.  It's Alice's Wonderland, it's demise is her doing and she must be the one to repair it.  The story will not be rehashed here, to remain free of spoilers, but it was intriguing and kept me going when some aspects of the game became monotonous.  I kept playing little by little to unravel more and see what was around the next bend.  Before we get to the important stuff, I liked this game, I possibly really like it.  Initially, I was enthralled when I first set foot in Wonderland and that feeling remained with me, almost, to the final screen.  The problem was that the game's repetition in level design, not ambiance, kept it from being Alice's Excellent Adventure.GameplayWhat would Wonderland be without conflict?  Luckily, Alice has a bevy of weapons (by the end, a total of 4) in her arsenal, all of which have some thematic significance to Wonderland.  These are split into melee weapons, like her Vorpal Blade and Hobby Horse, and ranged weapons like her Pepper Grinder and Teapot Cannon.  The Clockwork Bomb, finds itself somewhere in the middle.  Although I had seen the weapon types in games beforehand, this new twist make them seem fresh and engaging.  Unfortunately, once all of Alice's weapons had been upgraded to the max, I found myself really only using one of the weapons in combat, as it seemed to do the most damage.Alice is also quite nimble.  In fact, get ready to jump.  A lot.  Alice: Madness Returns utilizes jumping, double jumping, and floating more than quite a bit.  She also has a power, called Shrink Sense, at her disposal.  When activated, it allows Alice to find hidden doors, platforms, or receive clues on what was ahead, etc.  She cannot do anything but walk, while accessing it, so in the case of hidden platforms that involve jumping to, you kind of have to jump to the memorized spot (although it does leave a brief glowing residue).  As you can imagine, this leads to a multitude of unsuccessful leaps.  I didn't get too frustrated with missing a platform, as Alice's demise is so peaceful and lovely.  When expired, Alice's form morphs into a cluster of butterflies flying away.  Additionally, when she does die, the place that she restarts is quite close to where she met her downfall, so it wasn't too much of a penalty, and surprisingly no loss from her health meter.  I think that the developers might have put those touches in, as they may have noticed that the game was a bit flawed, and their inclusion would reduce frustrationIf you've read my other reviews, I've mentioned my affinity for collectibles.  If done the proper way, I don't mind spending extra time on levels, in fact I enjoy it.  This game really does collectible hunting wondrously.  There are multitudes of collectibles, but in this case memories, to hunt for.  The majority are not right out in the open and involve using some crafty contemplation.  Each memory, when located, reveals a little bit about Alice's thought processes or past and delves into her mind, revealing the clues essential in resolving her inner conflict.The level design starts to get a bit stale on the third (of 6 total) chapter.  While the vistas and locales change, it's essentially jump from and onto platforms, pull levers, fight a few enemies, slide, fight a few more enemies, and repeat 1-2 times more until the end of the level.  The levels, or chapters, are also quite long.  Initially, it threw me, but didn't bother me too much by the end.  While they are broken up into smaller bits, or sub-chapters, they are inaccessible if you need to restart an area (missed a collectible), until the whole chapter is completed.  While I was collectible hunting, chapters could take a couple of hours, or longer to complete.  Obviously less, maybe by half, if you just rushed through, but then again you would be missing key clues to the story, by not accessing memories.Within each large level, are a few scattered mini-games.  I thought these were well done, as they typified the level they were in.  In fact, I think they should have figured more prominently throughout Alice: Madness Returns.  My favorites were where Alice turned 2-D and had retro side scrolling adventures.  In the underwater levels, she commandeered a ship and had to blast fish and mines, Defender-style.  Alice actually climbed into paintings in the Far East levels and navigated her way around (more jumping!).  Others had you guiding a macabre doll head Super Monkey Ball style, rearranging blocks, pressing musical notes, and even playing rudimentary chess.GraphicsAmerican McGee certainly has a unique creative vision.  I marveled at the contrast in styles which were exemplified in each level.  Since the Chapters are so long, the same graphical design does not stay constant, thankfully.  The first introductory chapter begins in a lush, psychedelic tropical environment vibrant in color, yet ends in a semi-monochromatic, steampunk kind of metal-infused world.  The creatures and inhabitants, also have taken steps towards the grotesque, as Alice's damaged psyche portrays them.  It's quite evident that Wonderland is in decay.The storytelling uses a mix of different types of cut scenes to convey what's happening.  Some are what you'd expect from a video game in 2011, but others are influenced by storybooks, with what looks like, 2-D paper cutouts.. The effects are this mix of nostalgia infused with today's technology.  Even in London, the other characters Alice meets have exaggerated features, and look like they could be creatures from Wonderland.SoundThe voice acting in Alice: Madness Returns is excellent, which makes Alice's story so much more believable and helps you form an attachment to Alice's circumstances.  Music throughout the game is the appropriate mix of violin and/or piano to make the adventure seem a little more creepy.Replay ValueWhile there is a New Game + feature available, I can't see much use in it.  Any collectibles missed can be accessed through the sub-chapter level selector.  I do recommend purchasing the DLC outfits and weapons pack for the game.  They make the game a tad easier through various bonuses you get while wearing, and it's only a couple of bucks.  Plus, they look pretty cool.  I played through using them and I think that added to my lack of frustration experienced.  For buyers of the retail copy, the original American McGee's Alice is available to download through a code included (Or available for $10 through PSN or XBL, if you purchased the game used)Rating7.7I enjoyed my time in Wonderland much more than I thought I would.  I expected a run of the mill third-person action adventure and got much more.  A little more of the mini-games and a little less jumping should be in order for her next game.  While the game at times feels a bit rushed and incomplete, I am definitely up for Alice's next adventure.  Alice: Madness Returns is a pleasant change of pace, and some of the sequences and experiences have stayed with me, even after I've moved on to other games.  A good deal now that it available for $40, and definitely worth a look when it drops below $30.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S. BubPros:Gorgeous graphicsDecent gameplayCons:Amateurish if consistent art designToo short","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Fun, but way too short","reviewText":"Unreal 2 isn't much different from its predecessor in most ways. In fact, there's really only three good changes: the adaptation of Half-Life style weapons selection, the addition of a story with characters and dialogue, and the new engine. On the other hand, there are several negative changes, most notably the very short duration of the game, the lack of multiplayer, and a far more restrictive style of play.As far as plot-driven games go, Unreal 2 isn't going to win any awards. The story is something a 12 year old sci-fi buff could pull out of their pants, and there's really no surprises to speak of. Simply put, this isn't much of an RPG, even though there's a dialogue tree. In an attempt to make the game flow with the story, the developers added mission objectives to be accomplished. This does work, but it constrains the player so much that you really don't do any exploration. The result is the exact opposite of the original Unreal (in which your sole objective is to get to the exit, killing everything in between) and I honestly can't say which was better.There is definitely less customization in this game. Most importantly, there's no multiplayer- it seems Atari expects you to get Unreal Tournament 2003 if you want that. All right, fine, but I would really have liked to put some of those new weapons to work on my friends. At the least they could have put in some sort of bot deathmatch to vent frustration and afford some replay value. As for the game itself, you're Marshal John Dalton. If you don't like that, too bad- he's all the player there is. The mission plot is linear, and you probably won't play it more than once. There are cutscenes between missions, where you go back to your ship and chat with the crew. That's fine, but there should be a way to skip them. Instead of collecting arms and ammo as you go, your health, shields, weapons, and ammo are all reset every level. I guess this might help out folks that can't aim or dodge, but I found it generally irritating.That said, there are a lot of mission objectives that are fun to do. Some allow you to command marines or place turrets to mow down enemies. Sadly, there's not much use for the sniper rifle, save for one objective on the second-last level. The locations you visit are varied, interesting, and exquisitely detailed. You also see many different types of enemies (and friends as well), not just a bunch of Skaarj as in Unreal.The highlight of the game has got to be the graphics- it really looks great, and fire effects in particular are amazingly well done. The weapons you get often have spectacular destructive capabilities (but beware- enemies will have these too) and are a pleasure to put to work. There's really no particular advantage in picking one weapon over another (except for running out of ammo) but the look and feel of the different guns makes it worth switching around.The AI, as before, is superb. Enemies won't just charge at you, or at least not unless they think they're going to win. They'll dodge your rockets and take cover, popping out to tap you on the melon before ducking back down. The handful of boss characters you encounter also have unique behavior, which is sometimes quite irritating. Each of the varied races behaves in a different manner, some of which might be familiar to Unreal players. However, despite the fact that I made it all the way through the first Unreal, the new bullet-deflecting Skaarj did mop the floor with me a few times.As far as game physics go, you do move a bit slow (must be all that armor) but you're also tougher than you were in the old Unreal. You can pick up shield and health charges, recharge at stations, or scavenge shields off dead enemies. The shields don't work like they do in games like Dark Forces, in that you still take health damage when you get shot. In fact, it won't be uncommon for you to die with a lot of shields left, so health is still the key factor. There's some interaction with the environment, but it's largely good old switch-pushing. Some puzzles are scattered throughout the play, but nothing particularly stupefying.In all, Unreal 2 is a shorter version of Unreal with updated graphics and a better (but not by much) story. If it hits the bargain bin, I'd definitely recommend it just for the looks. Otherwise, this one's only for folks that just can't get enough of Unreal.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS5","reviewerName":"jdealy999","summary":"Another great Mega Man installment.","reviewText":"Once the Mega Man franchise started to hit really big with Nintendo fans, each new installment of the series kept getting better and better.  Mega Man 3 introduces his robot dog companion, Rush.This is probably my favorite installment of the six.  Mega Man 3 has a completely AWESOME soundtrack, most notably from Gemini Man, Magnet Man, Snake Man, and the BEST stage of all -- Top Man.  I didn't like the Needle Man stage too much because he is such a headache.After you've beaten all of the 8 stages, you have to re-enter the Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, and Spark Man levels which have been re-designed.  Twice in each level, you will have to face off with a robot mini-boss who \"absorbs\" the powers of the robots from Mega Man 2.  And he is extremely difficult to beat -- thank goodness for the energy tanks, huh?!When you face Dr. Wily on the very last level, you will need to use the Hard Knuckle to take away half of his energy.  Once he reveals his face, Snake Man's weapon is the only one that is vulnerable to his ship.  Enjoy the great ending that follows, because he will return again in Mega Man 4 through 10 mwah hah hah!!  :)I truly wish there were some more Mega Man installments for the Nintendo 3DS or Wii U -- I have no idea why Capcom has not done that yet, so they are really keeping the fanatics waiting...oh well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0030MQPQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"Good fanservice and a decent game that doesn't exceed expectations. Worth a try if you like Tron","reviewText":"I like this game. I grew up on Tron as a kid, and now my 2 & 1/2 year old son is in love with the series as well, naturally because of all the eye candy. Tron Evolution delivers in that department despite suffering from some serious Uncanny Valley at times.Tron Evolution is a prequel of sorts to the recent movie Tron:Legacy, and serves to explain some of the backstory elements that take place between the first movie and this one. For fans of the series, this is a nice bonus.As a game, Tron delivers but doesn't exceed. The game is kind of a 50/50 split between Prince-of-Persia style platforming and 3d-brawler combat. Everything looks stunning, and once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is fun enough, and at times surprisingly challenging, but there are issues. The control layout is a little weird, and there are things you have to do to pull off moves that are non-intuitive.  The camera is bordering on a disaster but not quite one. Some of the wall jump obstacles seem arbitrarily difficult. And the game is EXTREMELY linear. like, even when you're running around in Tron City, even if there are doors to areas or people around, you can't open the doors or talk to the people - they're just decorations and you really only ever have one way to go. This is an issue for a lot of games but in this instances it's not disguised particularly well at all and therefore is even more glaring.The upgrade system is interesting and for being essentially a one-weapon combat system the game gets a fair amount of mileage out of it, I've definitely played worse. Controls again take some getting used to, but are fairly fluid and understandible once you get the hang of it.The voice acting and story are stellar, and there are some Tron favorites in here (Bruce Boxlietner, for one, and Olivia Wilde, too). While Jeff Bridges did not voice Flynn or Clu, the guy they had to do it nailed it so well you almost can't tell the difference, it's really spectacular - I had to look it up to make sure it wasn't actually Jeff. Unfortunately, as I said the face models in this game are pretty terrible. They LOOK like the characters they're supposed to be enough, but look extremely dead and uncanny-valleyish. Some are worse than others - the Clu/Flynn characters look particularly bad, while Tron looks much better, though, and the player character has no problems because he's always wearing a helmet, however.In the end this game is OK. it's definitely worth picking up if you're a Tron fan, especially at a reduced price. If you have the choice, I would recommend the PS3 version for the 3D capability. While it's not something most people are likely to get much mileage out of, it's nice to have the option and DOES look neat. Worth a play at $10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2013"}

The way the achievements are set up is that you get 15 for beating a mission on normal and 25 for beating it on hard.

The triggers make it great for shooters and the more easily accessed bumper buttons are an improvement for button heavy RPG gaming.

I played through COD:Ghosts with vibration on and went back for trophies and the battery is still going strong after a bunch of other gaming since with only the first charge.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

The story was more compelling and better yet, I had a chance to decide my Jedi's path.  Simply put, this game is one of the best role-playing games for the PC in years.  Now the game does use Dungeons and Dragons rules and it's not an action-based game.  In other words, you will assign your character and his henchmen duties that they must perform in combat and watch the results (which are determined or prerolled by the computer) played out in front of you.  It works similar to the popular D&amp;D gaming series Baldur's Gate only with a more cinematic engine. (It's also made by the same people.) Also, don't expect to meet Luke Skywalker anytime soon as the events in this game take place at least a thousand years before the classic trilogy.  Don't let that sway you from buying the game though because it has a fantastic story with its own classic heroes and villains.  Blasters, Dark Jedis, classic planets such as Tatooine and plenty of fixtures from the Star Wars universe are in the game.  Plus, the story has a nice twist that will knock your socks off! A fun game for any RPG fan. If you don't enjoy the RPG genre or only prefer quick games with little reading, don't pick it up, you probably won't enjoy it, but everyone else should give it a try.  If I had to make a list of the top five games for the PC in 2003, this game would be on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004EDJOYC","description":"","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Not bad for the price.","reviewText":"I was a big fan of PS2 Sniper Elite which I still play.It's nice to see a new version of the Genre.The PS3 version has been tweaked over the 360 and PC versions.There are extra levels and some glitches have been resolved.Graphics are outstanding when crawling through bushes leaves look very life-like.Along beaches you have ripples in sand from the tide etc.Cut scenes look great and are short and to the point.Frame rates rolled along fine.No glitches detected by me yet.Likes:Sound is great as is music,Bullet cam like Sniper elite is really cool.I enjoy the realistic bullet drop and the factoring of the wind and weather and shooter position.Breathing and heart rate also factor in.I target shoot so can attest to the importance of that.The stalk is what makes this game fun.One must keep down and take their time.Sniping in the real world is 90% stealth 10% shooting.One also gets throwing knives,grenades,pistol and some other goodies.BF and COD players might as well not waste their money as this game,as it requires patience.And not rushing around bunny hopping and shooting.Reticles on scopes are well done.I own a SVD the scope is correct except for the variable zoom.Gameplay is fun and some missions require you to support others.One mission requires you to time your shots so the enemy won't hear them.One normal level a red dot will appear to show you where your bullet will hit.Once I learned the game I went to Hardcore which does not have that.Controls are simple and there is not too much of a learning curve.Dislikes:As others have said AI is very poor.I would have hoped enemy snipers would be smarter.The AI in Sniper Elite was much better.In the crouch stance one can't climb stairs for some reason?I would have liked to pick my own loadout before a mission.I would have preferred more room to maneuver on the maps.Not that they are small but a free roam would have made this game really fun.Overall I like this game, It requires one to think and is challenging.There are hidden intel items which increases replay for me.I find myself going back and trying to do missions better.For $39 it is worth it in my opinion.I have poor service in my area so I'm unable to review online play.I do remember Sniper Elite had a large following online.I would think this game will too.Give it a shot if you want a challenge.Update 7-21-11Finished the story mode and now on the bonus mission.I really enjoyed this game on hard.It makes it very satisfying to make a headshot without any aid.I only wish the spotter when you have one, would call your shot.So you are able to make corrections on the fly.The challenge mission has a limited hud and no map.And players have to finish the mission.The only time you can restart from the checkpoints is if you die.In the bonus missions the L96 and Cheytech rifles are used.Worth $40 IMHO this should tie me over for the summer since new releases look bleak until fall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

Also while the basic Wii U only has 8GB of space if you buy the physical copies instead of the digital downloads you'll be fine for a while unless you buy a ton of Wii U games then you'll probably need and external hard drive soon.This console feels primarily for the longtime Nintendo fans who are looking to prolong their Nintendo time as most of the games that so far have been released are already on the other two consoles already(PS3/Xbox 360) so unless you don't have these games and wish to add them to your Wii U gaming library any real Nintendo game is going to take a while to be released for us here in the States.The biggest question I'm sure many people have is is this system worth getting for $300?, and that's tough to answer as it really depends on your own preference and what game genres you like to play. Is this a good system if you have kids?I'd say yes but if they're in their teen years and are more into the hardcore action gaming and could be a toss up to this and the new upcoming next-gen PS4 and Xbox 720.Online service is also a mixed opinion,while I already had the Call of Duty for my PS3 hence no need for the Wii U version I did see the Wii U connects very well for the Nintendo store and Miiverse community still you'll probably not see a large gathering at this time of gamers online ready to play COD Farcry and the like.So for fans of Nintendo a good system awaits you and for other gamers a choice you must make on your own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2013"}

First off, I bought it when it was on sale for $29.99. It arrived quickly and to my surprise, came with a nice artbook full of artwork from the game. The quality of the book and print wasnt all that great, but still...it was an unexpected bonus.Now, about the game. I remember preordering this game about 2 years ago and was bummed when it got delayed. I wasnt exactly sure what to expect, but it looked very similar to Golden Axe, which was one of my favorite games. Well....it does have some similarities, but it is very very different and much more involved.The art in this game is amazing. Its amazing to know the entire game was hand drawn.Also, the soundtrack is out of this world. There are many parts that remind me of lord of the rings, however, the soundtrack stands on it own.The gameplay is also very addictive. I love the added missions and the main story line seems to be pretty decent as well. The narration is also done very well.This game is truly a work of art among being a very fun and addictive game. I like that it is easy to pick up this game and play for a short period of time and be able to pick up right where you left off. The game makes it very easy to remember what to do next because the narrator tells you when you start up where you left off. But it is also very easy to get sucked into this game and play for hours on end.I dont usually pay full price for games, but this game would have been worth the full price if I paid it.I highly recommend this action / rpg game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

IF THIS ISN'T A FIVE STAR AFFAIR NOTHING IS!!!","reviewText":"After 2 years of waiting and after having read several professional online reviews for Uncharted 3 I still didn't believe Naughty Dog could top the spectacle known as Uncharted 2. I'm a firm believer now! I was anticipating and wanting this game so bad that I canceled my amazon release date delivery order and instead went and stood in line(relatively small line) at Wal-Mart at midnight last night to procure myself a copy. Cue the caffeine... and lots of it! You see, I'm an RN and I typically work 7a.m. to 7p.m. and that's what happened yesterday. I haven't been to sleep since 5:30a.m. yesterday and have been playing Uncharted 3 since a little past midnight and it is now a little after 4a.m. Not really tired, just needed a break. And what better way to do so than give my thoughts on the epic construct known as Uncharted 3.I'm not sure how far I am into Uncharted 3(percentage wise) but I would guess close to halfway. My initial playthrough I'm not worried about digging up all the secret treasures or trying to all the unlock trophies. It's all about enjoying the gameplay, graphics, and story the first time through. And what an enjoyment so far! If it's even impossible, somehow the graphics look better than Uncharted 2 and they were gorgeous. The locations and setpieces are breathtaking in Uncharted 3! The gameplay is deeper this time around. Run and gun is fun! Disarming weapons and taking them away is a blast. Beating an enemy with the stock of a rifle is hilarious(maybe it's a combo of lack of sleep and caffeine causing that to be funny). The duck and cover system is the same as always, which means it's perfect and Naughty Dog knew better than to mess with it. The climbing has improved, although I thought it was excellent in the first two games. To me, it seems the action is much more frenetic and fastpaced. I consider myself I fairly experienced Uncharted player and there have a few areas playing it on Normal that gave me a very good challenge. All the better to have picture control and Uncharted 3 delivers here!Oddly, I never got into the story with the first two games, but this one, for some reason, has grabbed my attention much more. I think it may be because it delves deeper into the story of Sir Francis Drake and Nate's connection to him. Kind of adds an aura of mystique. Also, we see more of the relationship between Nate and Sully develop, and that of Nate and Elena, too. Katherine Marlowe makes for a very good villianess/archnemesis. I can't stand that lady! The sound is a masterpiece. Gunfire. Voice acting. Musical score. It's all perfect. Probably the best thing about Uncharted 3 is the drama. The emotions. You will really feel in touch with Nate in this installment and feel what he feels. You may even feel your heart clench a bit. No joke.There's not really a lot I can say either way to make you want to go out and buy this mega-amazing game. You've probably already made up your mind way in advance that you're going to purchase it. If there is anyone out there with any doubts I hope this review beats them away, because you will be missing out on what is already my favorite game of alltime! Uncharted 3 is the reason why we've kept our PS3's for five years straight, through good times and bad. It's reason why we live to be gamers. Simply put, it just doesn't get any better than this. This is a game you'll be playing for years to come. Do you need anymore reasons to buy Uncharted 3? I thought not. A perfect 10 out of 10 game. This is a carbon copy of a masterpiece!****UPDATE****Near the end of the game and it just keeps getting better and better. The setpieces are masterful all the way through. I don't think Hollywood could have pulled this off better. Nothing negative at all to report... and I do mean at all. I can find nothing that I don't like in this game. Have played about 9 hours of the single player and am going to stop because my eyes are burning. Haven't played multiplayer yet but I'm sure it's awesome as well. There is one part(I won't give too much away) that will tear at you emotionally involving Nate. When a game can pull that off it puts it in the upper echelon of videogamedom. I started out playing on normal and I must say that it gets quite challenging towards the end! Also of note: I've read in other reviews where it was stated that swimming with Nate is awkward and difficult. I don't think so. I guess it all depends on the user, but I thought the controls were right on. I may update again once I've played the multiplayer...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

I'm a fairly big Halo fan having had Halo:Combat Evolved on the original Xbox through Halo 2, which I found somewhat disappointing, to Halo 3 (I grew to hate the SP in 3) and now to Halo Reach. I skipped ODST primarily because of the lack of the main man Master Chief. So why pick up H:R since it too doesn't have MC? Well it has all of the awesomeness of Halo:CE and none of the fluff that I hated in Halo 2 and 3. Plus playing as noble six was actually more engrossing than chief just because of the customization of the character. In fact just based on my experience with Reach I may go back and buy ODST.I won't go into the story too much but it really is an amazing prequel to Combat Evolved that ties everything up so well. I almost feel like setting up my old Xbox to effectively continue the story set up by Reach.Graphically this is Halo 3. I didn't really notice anything that set it apart as a major upgrade from the third installment's visuals. As before, theater and Forge show just how amazingly detailed the individual models, environments and special effects are. I don't think there's another game currently that can stand up to the scrutiny of pausing a replay *anywhere* to take a screenshot from any angle or distance. And the game stores everything you do, from SP to forge to multiplayer.Aurally too things are pretty much as before - amazing spacial 3D sound if you have a 5.1+ surround system through DTS. Nothing to complain about, voice acting in cut scenes is top notch as is the music of course.Speaking of cut scenes, they're 100% rendered in game. As I mentioned your character is massively customizable and these changes carry into the game - change your suit's color then your character in game also changes. Not just in MP but in single player. And the level of customization is amazing. But you can't just slap on some pretty items, you have to earn them. And boy will it take some time to acrue enough points for the higher level stuff.So how does it play. Well obviously it's Halo so there's everything you expect - no dual wielding though and personally I didn't miss it one bit. The game also doesn't fall into the trap that Halo 3 did in so much as clearly locking you into an area without sufficient ammo or tools to get the job done. In Reach, just as you think some part of the single player campaign is impossible you'll stumble over some item a cunning level designer left just for you to finish things off. I played the SP through normal then Heroic (as I've always done in Halo games) and then I try Legendary. With Halo 3 I came to hate the third run through, solely because of the part where you're in the beast's guts and it kept cutting to that stupid voice over, interrupting the action and annoying the player. There's no parts like that in Reach thankfully and I completed Legendary alone over a period of three nights. And I loved every minute of it. I like the fact that there's separate achievements for completing it in Co-Op and extra credit for doing it alone entirely. It's not very often you get 275 Gamerscore points in one go!Now when it comes to Multiplayer well I was never a huge fan of it to be honest, preferring COD:MW's MP, but I'm enjoying it for what it is. I do like the fact that bungie are constantly adding new game modes (loving Swat!) and are also about to release a patch for coop campaign matchmaking too. Wow.This is a stunning addition to the franchise and I haven't been this excited about a Halo game since the first one. I have zero complaints about it... and if you read my other game reviews you'll see that's really rare. You probably already own Reach, but if not what are you waiting for?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

Finally all the charactors where playable in the one game, even hidden charactors where findable like a cool charactor named Chameleon who was a ninja, but kept changing, he'd morph into scorpion, sub zero, reptile, rain ect...All the charactors where there. But not all the backgrounds where, a few where missing. What made this game the best was turning on one button fatality isntead of memorising thousand step codes that wouldnt always work. You's just go to the options menu and hold Up, and the block buttons or something and it would let you access a secret option menu where you could select the cool cheats. One button fatalitys was the best, you could press one button when it said finish to do the finisher 1, 2, freind shipm animality ect.. this is still my favorite MK game.

The technology works pretty well and you won't have to buy any more controllers. The issue is games. Launch games were pretty much just updated Wii titles. After the launch almost nothing has been made that is worth the money. Some games use voice command, and that is about it. I have not seen any reviews for any Kinect exclusive games. You also look pretty stupid while you play this. People might wonder what those strange hand motions are. Worse, some games RECORD you while you play. The Wii Motion Plus is by far superior. I don't mind paying 20 bucks for an accessory that allows me to play Zelda and a new Wii Sports. I do mind paying $150 for a camera that allows me to play Wii titles with a Microsoft logo slapped on it. If you think the Wii libary is dissapointing, just wait until you buy this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2012"}

There is a story, but it is more cleverly and meticulously crafted lore that keeps the game world interesting.  While it has a huge learning curve, I highly recommend this title.

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Riyad Kalla","summary":"An unexpected surprise for God of War fans.","reviewText":"This review is for all the people, like me, that have been aware of this title for months and never gotten it because you weren't *quite* sure if you would like it. You loved the God of War series and heard this is a \"ripoff\" of it, but you are still not sure about it...If this sounds like you, grab a copy of Dante's Inferno, you will really like it.I expected a rough attempt at re-creating God of War with lots of niggling issues like bad controls, poor camera or lame enemy design and that just is not what happened. Dante's Inferno is an very nicely polished first-release and the team that did it knew exactly what they were doing.Games like this tend to ratchet up the visual intensity of the story by way of gore, nudity and/or just disturbing mutant creations... and all of that is here (thankfully) in Dante's Inferno. If you like how visceral God of War is, namely God of War 3, you'll love that Dante's Inferno doesn't pull punches. It is a mature game for a mature audience.The storyline moves along at a great clip, there is the entertaining bad-guy grind through each level of hell ending with a boss fight that has some relationship to Dante. I can't complain about any of the boss fights or \"cheapness\", it was all enjoyable. There wasn't one part of the game that stood out as maddening to me (which is always what I worry about) but I did play on EASY because I am always more interested in progression and story than actual challenge.\"Easy\" in Dante's Inferno was just right to give a casual player a nice challenge so it is not a walk in the park, but also not hard enough to make dying and retrying the norm. I didn't try it on harder levels but have heard from friends that it scales accordingly.I found the character of Dante's wonderfully voice acted and liked playing him; this is surprisingly important to me. Kratos is easy to like, he's a badass. Dante channels Kratos in some regards, but is also more human. Thankfully he is not hollow or poorly acted and feels like a great avatar to take you through the journey.Solid 8.5 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

Obraztsov","summary":"This is not an RPG...","reviewText":"I have been playing Final Fantasy since Final Fantasy I, and over time the games have become worse and worse, and this one tops it off.  What do I expect when I play an RPG?  Well, I plan on there being some interactions in towns with NPCs, side quests, and other fun things.  Instead, this game is just a looonngg mission.  Eventually the game opens up a little (but barely), and I kept wondering, \"When is this going to get interesting?\"  For the first 10 hours I kept saying, \"Well, I'll take care of equipment when I reach a town.\"  Well, you'll have a long wait if you do that.If I want to do repetitive missions, there are plenty of games for that.  Not only is it repetitive and quite boring, you can very rarely travel back to places you came from.  There's never a break or \"slow-pace\" in the game, which most Final Fantasy's have, and that's part of the allure to them.  One of my favorite things about Final Fantasy XII was toward the end, your ability to go back and visit nostalgic places like Midgar and where Cloud met Aeris, etc.  There's nothing like this here.  The characters are rather boring as well, and the story is cliche.  I expect my RPGs to have a lot of fun side quests, linearity, and to be able to talk to NPCs and engage in dialogue.It's hard to believe that Final Fantasy XIII can't even beat the quality of Final Fantasy IV.  I was so looking forward to this and expecting so much, and it turns out that Square Enix was just *lazy.*  I expect a lot more in the future.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2012"}

An instant classic.","reviewText":"Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack In Time is a phenomenal game which is leaps and bounds above Tools Of Destruction...which is quite impressive because the first in the \"Future\" trilogy of Ratchet & Clank was no slouch of a game.The controls are easy, the camera (although sometimes having a mind of its own)complements and follows play smoothly, and the sound (my biggest gripe with ToD and QfB) is fantastic.The graphics are much improved (may sound odd...seeing as the graphics are purposely cartoony) to the point you can see individual Lombax hairs and subtle changes in the shape of faces for expression.  So far (two stages in) I'm missing the comedy bad guys that were present (yet still effectively tyrannical) in the prior two episodes.  I will, however, admit to one giggle-worthy moment from Dr. Nefarious.The weapons and gadgets (still have a TON to get) are truly original all over again and massively fun to use in the creation of explosions and wanton destruction around Ratchet.  What is there not to love about a genetically enhanced belching reptile with a hair trigger?Side missions with Clank still feel a little...meh...but it's good to follow his side of the story and is a welcome break after joining Ratchet in narrowly avoiding death 62 and 1/3 times.  Clank has his own brand of humor that works...but works better when combined with a certain wrench-wielding, sarcastic Lombax.There has been an element of...almost non-linear gameplay added which I have fallen absolutely in love with.  I can get to the story when I want and have fun things to do on the side (with very pleasurable rewards) to build me up for story missions.The radio is a rather creative addition.  I keep going back to the techno-trance station while cracking heads and cooking threads with 'ol Mr. Zircon and his smack-talking self while jetting around moons and asteroids in search of bonuses on my jet boots.I'm rambling now so I will end here by saying that Insomniac has, once again, produced a real gem.  Hilarious, action-packed, and a welcome addition to any gamer's library.  I wouldn't rent this one or wait for it used, folks...there's fun to be had RIGHT NOW and you shouldn't be missing out.I'm already hoping for the next R&C; game that will have to work to make it above an even higher bar set by Crack In Time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Console caliber game play on the go","reviewText":"I've had my Vita for two weeks now, and think I have good enough feel to write a review. As background, we in family have PS3 with Move, Xbox Kinect, iPhones, iPad, Android, Nintendo DS and 3DS, and had a Wii.The look of Vita is OK to me, not sexy but not dull either. I care only about three things for this portable game console: 1) type of games I want to play, 2) usability of the hardware to play and enjoy those games...anywhere, and 3) remote play.Let me just get the Remote Play out of the way. It was quite disappointing as none of the PS3 games I have work with remote play. These are mainly driving games (not Wipeout), shooting, action, and adventure games. The Vita trailers for Remote Play showed KillZone 3, and of course it didn't work. If the decision and enhancements are up to game developers, Sony should footnote as such. The console has plenty to offer and footnoting this upfront would not have caused a huge let down for someone like me. Minus one star for this marketing omission.Onto the games. I am a big fan of Uncharted series so it's a no-brainer to try the console with the game. Unit 13 was perfect as I love console shooting games. Many other games launch titles are cool as well, and there are few exciting titles worthy to spend the money on in addition to the smartphones and 3DS.But usability is important for playability. The right analog knob is great for many games. I played through many hours and didn't feel fatigue for my hand and fingers (but needed to stretch of course). The joysticks can take great deal of directional force, since at max the knobs will touch the console surface. Many games took advantage of the motion sensors and accelerometer in Vita, as with other portable devices. But my absolute favorite is exposing hidden symbols on an apparently blank scroll in Uncharted. One must have a light source (e.g., a lamp or flashlight) behind the Vita. As I move Vita around the light, the brightest portion of the scroll gets exposed and symbols appeared slowly!! What a novel idea to use a camera/video recorder!As for the sound output, Vita is just adequate but not immersive enough for PS3-caliber games like Uncharted Golden Abyss. But that is OK as I got all the immersive experience from a good pair of stereo headphones. The bass is strong for grenades, and I could hear the directions of bullets, nature sounds and water flows when viewing 360! *UPDATE: I just used a Belkin bluetooth stereo receiver and input that to home theater receiver, and it rocks the room!Other things worth noting, but I considered them secondary benefits/issues:* Battery: I get 3-4 hours of play (not online) on a full charge. When downloading stuff on the background, this drops to less than 3 hours.* \"Near\" app is cool to see what's around and who's playing what. I look forward to try to exchange some stuff.* There is LiveTweet, Facebook, and Netflix.  Netflix implementation is simple and doesn't take advantage of swiping. It chokes on weak wi-fi and can bring down system.* Content Manager is good to backup games to PC/PS3, and copy music, videos, and pictures. But there is no playlist support on the Music Player?!?* Pressing \"PS\" button with \"Start\" will take a screen capture as a picture and send off (email, facebook, etc).* Welcome Park app has few cool playful games. One I like is take a picture and then scramble it to solve as a puzzle.Overall I am very pleased with Vita as the first real serious portable console with near-console quality game titles. My serious gaming preference is with PS3, and did purchase GAEMS G155 to take my PS3 with me on the road.  Vita may allow me to take PS3 on the road a little bit less (but not completely).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}

Thanks for getting us in and out and safely back to our cars.Yesterday, I went to Gamestop to pick up any games and accessories needed as my pre-order had already been paid for several weeks prior. The manager at the store had told me to come back at 6pm to get my number in line as the only PS4s they were releasing at midnight were just those that were already paid for.  I came back at 6pm, and I got number 15, which meant no matter what time I came back, that was my place in line.As this particular Gamestop was 5 minutes away from my home, I left at 11:50, arrived and parked at 11:55 and was in line at 11:58.  They let people in 3 at a time, checked receipts, handed them their system and it was done.  The line moved fast and I was out by at least 12:10 and back home around 12:15.Everything about setting up the PS4 was simple.  In less than 10 minutes the system was hooked up and on and I had no problems with the HDMI cables or the power cord.  Once the system was connected to the internet the &#8216;dreaded&#8217; 300mb update was ready to begin.And guess what?  It was quick and painless!!  It took 2 minutes for the update to download and another 5 minutes for it to install and reboot my system.  By now it was just after 12:35 am.After another 5 or 10 minutes of doing the initial setup, the PS4 was ready to go and the longest part of doing the setup which I canceled until this morning was getting my PSN account logged back in, which at that point I think it was just an issue with the server but it went straight through this morning.At 12:45 am, I was playing FIFA 14.I have to say, the system itself is very sleek and blends right in to my cabinet and does a much better job than my PS3 did. In fact the profile is so small, you hardly notice that it&#8217;s there.  You would also notice that the machine does have some weight to it and it doesn&#8217;t feel flimsy.The new Dualshock 4 controllers are comfortable and I do like the design change as it accommodates my large hands and feels more natural and of course it will take some getting used to the &#8220;Options&#8221; button which replaces the &#8220;Start&#8221; button.I did try out the Remote Play aspect this morning and once you get it up and running it works.  A piece of advice however is this; if you have issues connecting upon the initial setup, completely shut down your PS Vita.  As a matter for fact, I would say do it BEFORE setting it up. Leave it off for about 5 minutes and then turn it back on.  Once you connect it should be smooth. I played a quick FIFA 14 game this morning and even scaled down on the Vita it is excellent, the controls are very responsive with very little lag.  The screen does hiccup occasionally and I hope that as time goes by with updates, it works seamlessly but finally I can take my game to other parts of the house!!!As I did not have time to sample all of the games,  FIFA 14 does show what is to come with a little extra polish. I will review that along with several others  and hope to have something posted Sunday or Monday.But for now, I am satisfied not only with the purchase but the ease of set up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

Played another 1 hr of Shadow Fall, exited game, clicked on Playstation Store, system froze up, screen went blank, controller only flashed when PS button pressed, but PS4 still had \"white\" instead of blue light.

As far as I'm concerned, Sony has officially JUMPED THE SHARK with this obviously DEFECTIVE PS4 system it has released to the general public.

Will try to return this to GameSchlop for a refund in order to go XBOX One.With so much development time and so much at stake, I have zero pity for Sony for completely blowing this!  There is no excuse that will satisfy me and my kids when we have been sold a DEFECTIVE product that Sony obviously had to know about prior to launch...Just inexcusable.12/26 UPDATE: BLOD again this morning.  Once again, removed hard drive screw, pulled and reinserted hard drive.  Booted up and played Shadow Fall 45min until had to leave.  This time put PS4 in \"Standby\" mode so I wouldn't have to keep doing the same stuff over and over in the game.  Came home and system wouldn't exit Standby...Just BLOD again.  Now won't even reboot by removing and replacing hard drive.  Sony Online Chat says:\"LIVE CHAT - Please Wait. Currently Busy.Sorry, agents are unavailable at this time.\"Called Sony instead.  Online says wait time \"Up to 15 minutes.\"  Phone answered by robot who says wait time is 45 minutes.  Obviously have to hold.

Shenmue II not only out does the first one in every way but surprasses it even more, this game is unbelievable.  It is handsdown, my favorite Xbox game ever...EVER.  The story continues with Ryu Hazuki on the journey to find his fathers murderer and to meet a man who may know alot of things about his father then he'd imagine.  Now the game takes place in Hong Kong, and Ryu is still on the hunt....get ready because not only are playing one of the best sequals to a game ever..but you'll be having one of the greatest video game experiences....ever..Shenmues Graphics are just amazing, As you've already notice I'm not going to give it a negative on visuals since it's not fair because this is a DIRECT PORT from Dreamcast....Those idiots like IGN and gamemagazines should of known this is a direct port and that the visuals were going to be bumped up, hell it would take poor suzukie EVEN MORE YEARS to make the visuals amazing....but who cares cause this game is still AMAZING.  The sound/music is just as beautiful as the original Shenmue, sometimes I'd just stand at one area and listen to the music..it's just so brilliant..  The level desighn for Hong Kong/Kowloo is just incredible, especially one the final chapter of the game, which I won't spoil.  Something I like Shenmue II more then Shenmue I is that Shenmue II is just one of those flat out \"Sequals that didn't fail one bit\" as I can see alot of people love this game but are dissapointed compared to the original...I'm not one bit, Something that Shenmue I had that made me fall in love with the game was the FREE BATTLES and QTE'S....Theres even WAY MORE of those in Shenmue II, and they've never looked so good on the Xbox.  Other then the sequal having more action then it's predecessor, something that I loved about Shenmue is that it got you all pumped up all the way to the grand finale...THIS DOESN'T FAIL AT ALL.  Especially the Yellow Head Building part, which is by far one of the greatest moments in Video game history..  Everything about Shenmue II on Xbox is amazing....It's just so Brilliant!!!!!Now for anyone who hated Shenmues Slow paced gameplay DO NOT GET THIS GAME, Shenmue II is just the same(but a lil better) as it's predecessor.  It will take awhile to get to the action....More like when you're at the end of the first chapter which by the far longest in this game..  Did I mention this has a very good Length..If you skip all the sidequests and just beat the story for the first thenmue, it would take about maybe...10 to 14 hours...It took me about 13 hours and 45 minutes.. Shenmue II takes about 20 to 30 hours of just playing the story mode of it and skipping some side quests....It's just bigger, better and longer...The Good-Superb Visuals and got a bit bumped up on the Xbox-longer then the original-the voice acting got a tad bit better but not by much-Theres more character development and we finally know what SHENMUE means!!-An amazing scenarion that has to do with the Yellow Head Building and LAN DI!!-More FREE BATTLES and QTE'S-More clues to find and people to ask, for me it was fun-The Music is beautiful-IT'S Just better then the original...that's all I can say about that....The Bad-The controls are TERRIBLE, I had to adjust em' before playing the game-It got a lot of bad review on lots of sites about it's visuals...they should have known it's a straight port from the Dreamcast-Just like the Dreamcast...Poor Sales for Shenmue II means NO Shenmue III in the future-Some like myself were left wanting more after Shenmue II's Ending...amazing though..Shenmue II on the Xbox is one of the best games ever made, and one of the most overlooked xbox title ever..period..  Just like every other Sega Game on Xbox...  Please if you liked the original you will LOVE Shenmue II, it's just better, longer, better looking, more action, MORE EVERYTHING!!  Why the perfect score?..Because on like most of the idiots who gave it abad score cause of Visuals, I'm being mature about it, so what if it's a direct port from DC, The visuals are still amazing even if it's no Doom 3 or Ninja Gaiden....Other then that, Shenmue II is just a beautiful game and that is why I give it a.......5 out of 5 stars...Brilliant game....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2005"}

I bought it because it was so cheap that it was practically free. Good thing too, it sucks!Xbox 360 games now have graphics that totally blow this game out of the water. The AI is a joke, and the controls are, well, its hard to describe but basically they suck. It just doesn't feel right.The biggest disappoint I have is that this game taints my wonderful memories of PD for N64. Now that was an awesome game. Playing PD N64 with my siblings was the best. The bots, the weapons, the levels, it was great. The controls were so much better on N64 too.Its too late to appreciate this game, too many other excellent jaw-dropping games are out... buy something like Halo or GoW.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0002B90SA","reviewerName":"Scott Sloan","summary":"An Xcellent Middle Chapter to the Kotor Series!!","reviewText":"I loved the first Knights of the Old Republic, and continued to play through it many times even after beating the game.  Yes it was that good!!!  And this comes from a person who does not consider himself a gamer.  The sequel Sith Lords adds a dose of polish to some of the rough spots from the original game, such as new Faces for the heroes, more choices and control over companions, and one of my favorites although a minor thing to some people.  The Jedi robes look much cool then they did in the first game.  Even more feats and Jedi powers have been added into the mix, and I am sure that everyone has their Can't Miss combonation that they choose EVERY time they play. I know i do!!  The graphics are very nice, and the gameplay is simple for if i can master it then anyone can.  it does take some practice and skill to acheive the right combo's of feats, skills, and powers so don't feel bad if you don't get it on the first play.The story follows the first game, this game taking place 5 years after the original game (new players should really play the first Knights of the old republic first to get the full effect of some of the lingo, and special appearences from the previous game.)  You are the last jedi, and of course the Sith are chasing you all across the galaxy, and you must use all of your abilities to either fight for the good, or the evil depending on your preferences.  Though it does not carry the whopper of a plot twist that the original carried, and one of the few downsides of the game in my opinion.  The story moves along very well in the beginning only near the end does it bog down a little bit in crosses, doublecrosses, and minor glitches in the game that left me puzzled with cut scenes that did not make sense such as the one scene where one character appears to kill another character but then all is forgotten once the cut scene has ended.  I'm sure that you have read that the game ends on a bit of a downer, only due to the fact that i suspect that Kotor III is due out sometime, cuz the game literally leaves you hanging in space.  Still it is an excellent game, for the Star Wars fan, and the casual gamer alike. Enjoy!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"kidnugget","summary":"Doesn't live up to the hype...","reviewText":"Halo 2 is a capable video game, but it falls flat of what it should be.  It has good AI, fun level design, decent graphics, and some good weapons upgrades from the original, but it lacks in several areas.  Having said that, I'm pretty uhappy with Halo 2 overall.Here are some gripes:1) It's just too short.  I played it very casually a few hours a week and beat it in no time.  Maybe 15-20 hours total.  Halo took forever with expansive levels, Halo 2 just feels short and hurried.2) [Minor Spoler] The story doesn't make a lick of sense.  Several of my friends and I all beat it.  Five of us (all college graduates, some professors of English who know a bit about story interpretation) have no clue what happened.  Something about a rift in the covenant or something and an arc?  The storry is muddy and choppy and confusing and unsatisfactory.  One friend of ours has gone door to door explaining the events of the game, assuring us it was a good story.  But if five out of six people just don't get it--that is far from good story telling.3)[Minor Spoiler] The ending is a giant set up for Halo 3.  I understand the principle of a cliff hanger, but don't set up major fights and what could be the best level of the game and then make us wait three years for the trilogy.  I endured three years of misery when I was kid waiting for Return of the Jedi.  I don't see myself sticking around and waiting for Halo 3 like that.5) There are virtually no new enemies from Halo 1.  Some flying critters and big hairy apes and maybe a variation on the energy shield weilding aliens.  Otherrwise, you might as well just play Halo.4) Audry II.  If you don't understand that, look up Little Shop of Horrors.  Lame.I was an avid fan of Halo, and I played plenty of lan parties with it, tried different difficulties and got every dime out of my fifty bucks on a groung breaking FPS that put the XBox on the map.Perhaps I'm so salty because with a reported $27 Million+ budget, I wanted it to be a 12 out of 10.  Instead it's maybe a 7, 8 tops.  I remember when the flood hit in the original, and my mind was blown.  I thought \"Now I see what all the hype was about!\"  In Halo 2, the hype is about hype.I slaved over Ilovebees.com all summer, waited in line at midnight, and was rewarded with game that's kinda cool.  Frankly, kinda cool isn't good enough.  I've been having more fun with Call of Duty on the Xbox, and I already played it on the PC.In all fairness, I haven't tried it out on Xbox live, and that's supposed to be pretty awesome.  I just with the game team learned a lesson from Unreal.  Spend some time making a great single player, and then just make a great Halo Online game.  Don't cheat us out of the Halo experience just to cater to the online gamers.  Not fair and definitely not cool.Halo 2 is a fun game, but save yourself the hype and expense and just rent it.  You'll beat it before it's due back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00002STFD","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Star Wars game with major issues","reviewText":"Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was released near the end of 1996 and was one of the first generation games for the N64. It's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.The PROS: Well, the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games. Even though the game has 9 levels, they are long levels so you won't be cruising through so easily.The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of \"pop up\" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title \"Tomb Raider\". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on \"easy\", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys. But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics, robot like controls, bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been. Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up. For everyone else, be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much, much better than this somewhat playable effort.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2011"}

Im only a couple hours into the game and so far it is great. It is more like RE4 More so than RE5. Still has alot of action but I can see how they were going for a horror approach as well. I really dont want to ruin the story for anybody but it is very dark from what Ive played so far. Much more of a story than RE5. Great pick up for a fan of the series if you have a 3DS.

{"product_name":"B0050SVLI2","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Reviving Evil","reviewText":"The Good:+A highly engrossing story filled with twists, turns and intrigue+A fantastic atmosphere+A lengthy campaign mode+Fantastic visuals+Very good use of sound+Makes VERY good use of the hardware and shows that the 3DS isn't just another DS but is capable of quite a bit when developers really put their all into itThe Bad:-Your AI controlled partner is useless-Slight dips in framerate (but never in very dangerous situations)When most of us think of the Resident Evil games on the handheld, they're not always fond memories.  First there was the deservedly underplayed \"Resident Evil: Gaiden,\" on the Gameboy Color.  Then we got our hands on a remake of the original game on the Nintendo DS with some slightly enhanced mechanics.  Last year we got a chance to play Resident Evil Mercenaries 3D.  The three games listed above weren't exactly games that the fanbase was raving about (in fact Gaiden was considered so bad CAPCOM decided it wasn't canon and they've swept it quietly under the rug).  So, of course, when Resident Evil Revelations was announced it was a wonder what CAPCOM had in store for their prime series now.  As it turns out, Resident Evil Revelations is a fantastic experience.  There are no gimmicks at play here.  It's a more traditional Resident Evil game filled with scares, eerie music and suspense.  Simply put, Resident Evil Revelations isn't just one of the best 3DS games you could buy at the moment... it's easily one of the best Resident Evil games you could buy.Set before the events of Resident Evil 5, Revelations focuses on the BSAA.  A counter Bio-Terrorism group started by Chris and Jill.  Our game begins when Jill and her partner Parker, sail out to the Mediterranean.  They've lost contact with Chris and his partner Jessica and their last known coordinates were there.  When they arrive they find a cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia, strangely abandoned.  And soon it becomes apparent why.  There are Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s) running around all over the ship.  One of the things that made some of the earliest Resident Evil games amusing was that there was a mystery at play.  A sort of, \"What's going on?\" feeling to the game.  Resident Evil Revelations has this in strides as the plot is actually extremely engrossing.  There's a lot of mystery and suspense.  And the stories are intertwined as we're introduced to new characters and situations that can, at times, take surprising turns.  The story is just all around amazing, and it'll keep you glued to your 3DS.  It also helps that the campaign itself is lengthy and even challenging at parts.  There isn't anything quite like it on the 3DS.As you go exploring the various environments you find yourself in, you'll come face to face with several enemies that are usually dispensed with your trusty weapon.  Aiming and shooting is similar to Resident Evil 4.  You can take aim at various parts of the body, and when your enemies stagger you can go in for a quick melee attack.  If you've kept up with the series since the fourth installment then this will be familiar to you.  You can aim either in first person or go for an over the shoulder view.  You can also strife while aiming, but chances are you'll find it much better to pop an enemy a couple of times, retreat and then pop them again.  There are, however a few things added to the game itself that keep it interesting.  You'll do a lot of running and gunning, but one of the most unique items your given is an item only known as Genesis, which you can use to scan several areas for hidden items or data on your enemies.  It's hard not to go into a room and use it.  The rewards are usually finding more ammo or precious herbs to heal your wounds.There aren't many puzzles in Resident Evil Revelations at all.  There are moments where you'll have to use the touch screen and move a few things around, but they're hardly mind-bending moments.  It's much more about the gunplay here and there's an emphasis put on that.  You'll not only find weapons but also custom parts for those weapons that will make them more powerful, or fire faster or perhaps might help them do a better job of stunning your enemies.  You can mix and match all you like and apply them to any type of weapon you want.After running through so many Resident Evil games, it's a wonder if Resident Evil can actually be scary anymore.  Well, not really.  But Revelations has various ways of trying to be scary.  The first and most obvious is the atmosphere.  Especially on the Queen Zenobia.  Hallways are suspiciously empty, music hits some really eerie notes, and sometimes you'll find dead bodies or see some enemies pop out as you run by.  Resident Evil has been doing these things since the very first installment and it's hard to be creeped out by the billionth enemy popping out at you when you've been exposed to that for sixteen years now.  In spite of the atmosphere and the mystery given by various documents you'll find through the game, Resident Evil Revelations isn't going to scare anyone.  You have to give credit to the game for trying at least.  It does this in other ways as well.  You'll find various keys to unlock locked doors, find yourself backtracking through previous rooms only to find them repopulated with new horror, and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering if you'll survive.  All this is compounded by some very well done set pieces.  Early on, for instance, you'll find yourself unable to stand as a pack of mutated dogs set their sights on you.  It's a very tense moment where you, the player, may actually begin to feel just a little frightened you won't survive.  Moments like this make you feel as though Resident Evil is returning to its roots.  So at the very least Revelations tries to be scary and give you a sense of fear.  It basically tries to take the best of the two styles of Resident Evil and mesh them together.  The atmosphere and mystery is inspired by the early installments while the gunplay is drawn from the latter ones.  It's a well put together hybrid.  Just don't expect it to scare the pants off you.No matter who the game has you play as, you'll always have a partner, and this is perhaps the most glaring shortcoming that Revelations has.  The rest of the game is great and it's other flaws forgivable, but when it comes to your partner, CAPCOM still hasn't made a competent one.  They won't spend time wasting your resources like Sheva in Resident Evil 5, but a lot of the time they just stand there doing nothing.  They rarely even shoot at your enemies, and most times they just follow you around like a confused puppy.  If they did a little more such as point out objectives or even tried to battle a little more it wouldn't be so bad.  The only use your AI partner really has is soaking up damage on your behalf.If there are any doubts about what can be done on the 3DS then let Resident Evil Revelations squash them.  This is by far the best looking game you can find on the 3DS at this point.  The places you'll run through are extremely detailed.  The character models look fantastic and the lighting is great as well.  There are a few issues with the presentation but none that stand from the games aesthetic design.  Namely that there were moments where the game seemed to buckle under it's own weight.  There were slight frame rate dips and moments where the load times are lengthy.  The good news is that none of these issues ever creep up when you're in any immediate danger.  The frame rate dips I experienced, for example, were while I was in an elevator.  But I never experienced them when I was in combat.Resident Evil Revelations also makes excellent use of the 3DS hardware.  The controls are actually tight and responsive and well mapped out.  Likewise, your inventory is all comprised to the bottom screen, while the top screen is perfectly clear of anything.  This seems like something small, but it actually really helps to draw the player in because there's nothing on the top screen to distract you from what's actually going on.  It's perfect.  When you take damage the top screen will get more \"bloodied,\" to give you a sense of how close you are to death.  But rather than having to into your inventory for an herb to heal, you simply tap a button and it's done.  Future 3DS games should take note.  Nothing here feels tacked on in terms of how it utilizes the hardware.The 3D is also very well done, although you won't ever actually need it.  It never really enhances the gameplay.  There's nothing that'll make you want to keep the 3D on all the time.  But it does increase the depth and isn't exactly used to make things \"Pop Out.\"  It enhances the presentation even if it doesn't enhance the gameplay.  At the very least it draws you into the atmosphere of the game much more.  You can also make it stronger in the games option settings.  From a visual perspective it is some of the best use of 3D on the system.One of the best aspects of Resident Evil Revelations is by far the sound.  The music is often eerie and builds up tension and suspense at some parts, but the screams from your enemies, or the creaking of the ship or the floor boards or even a shot from your pistol all sound remarkable coming from the 3DS's tiny speakers.  The voice acting is also competent, even if the writing isn't always up to standard.Simply put, in terms of hardware usage and just all around competent game design, Resident Evil Revelations is one of the best titles you could get on the 3DS.  It's fun and immersive, but also tells a very good story.  It even has moments where it tries to get back to Resident Evil's traditional style.  The game won't scare you much at all, but at the very least it's willing to try... and manages to be fun in the process.  If you like Resident Evil and own a 3DS then you have to play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2012"}

It looks phenomenal and is a real joy to play. You play as Nate Drake in search of Sir Francis Drake's lost treasure. I've always had a soft spot for games that reference historical figures like this and Uncharted comes through in spades. The gameplay is very natural and intuitive and the voice acting is great as well. I never had any difficulty getting the hang of the controls at all. The hand to hand combat is also very cool and enough to make you want to toss your weapons at times just to validate your Man Card. The story keeps your attention and the cutscenes are not too long or too short. And I think the killer aspect of the game that just brings it all home is the fantastic score. This is what developers need to look for when getting the music for a new game. This is even better than my other favorite modern game score Halo 3. This is also one of the first games to come out with trophies after Sony announced them for PS3 and I will always give props to developer Naughty Dog for giving the people what they want.

Lego Indiana Jones was even better because I'm a bigger fan of the Indy movies than Star Wars. The problem with having a video game series is that the next game will always be compared to the prior ones. You could get an endless discussion from gamers on why certain Final Fantasy games are better than others.This leaves Lego Batman in the predicament of being the 3rd in a series with big britches to fill. In some ways it doesn't disappoint. The creators' choice to follow mostly the comics rather than the extremely convoluted movies was an excellent choice. Yet they used Danny Elfman's scores from the first movie, another excellent choice.You play all the levels as villains and heroes, which makes for extra fun. All the great Batman characters are there (although I don't follow the comics so I have no clue about the moth guy or Man Bat) and the different hero suits add to the challenge in various situations. In addition, there are vehicle levels in which you get to get behind the wheel of the Bat Mobile, pilot the Bat Wing, and cruise in the Bat Boat, in addition to the sidekick vehicles of Robin and all the villain rides.My major gripe with this game is in relation to unlocking everything and getting 100% completion. First with regards to unlocking everything, there is one character (I won't spoil it by saying who) that you can't unlock until you get 100% completion. This seems rather silly since I know I wouldn't feel any desire to go back and play the levels with this character after having played the levels multiple times to get 100% completion. Also, you have to play through both bonus levels to get 100% completion, which leads to my second gripe.In the Wayne Manor bonus level you have to collect 1 million studs to finish the level. Unlike prior bonus levels like Lego City in Indiana Jones, this level is a rather tedious strategic search for studs rather than a fun smash it up free for all. In my copy I seem to have run into an apparent glitch in Wayne Manor that is leaving me one purple stud shy of 1 million studs. There is a block I need to break to get the stud, but the block won't break. So now I can't get 100% completion and can't unlock that last character.Overall the game was pretty fun, but it did fall a bit short compared to Lego Star Wars and Lego Indiana Jones.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2009"}

She bought it for me as a present and we played through the first level together and I didn't pick up the game after that for some 6 months...My son, who is 4, has really enjoyed the few Playstation 2 games I have picked up for him, but they are pretty limited since he is so young. There just aren't that many out there that a toddler is able to play or that are appropriate for his age group. Well, while this game has some very minimal violence, I decided to let him try it and thought it'd be fun since we could play together. HE LOVES IT! Suprisingly, he's pretty good at it too. It's not so easy that he could finish a whole level on his own, but it's not so complicated that it easily frustrates him either. I especially like that I can just drop out at any time (if I have something I need to attend to) and he can keep playing like it's no big deal. Then I can just jump right back into the game at any time. While there are a couple of frustrating aspects to the two-player, I really enjoy playing this game with my toddler son. Even though he usually prefers to just goof around and think of creative ways to make Robin die, he has a blast and gets some quality 'dad time' in all at once. Good game, particularly if you are / were a fan of the Batman animated series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2010"}

And I have played a lot of games in my life.**Sorta SPOILER** (sorta because it happens in like the first 10 minutes of the game and it's on the back of the box)So, you are an author and someone else is writing your story for you and it starts to come true. I'm sure that sounds cliche. Like it has been played out many, many times before (in stories more, less in video games).**END SPOILER**But this game is far from cliche. It is unique and very intriguing. This game will pull you in instantly. It feels like you have been playing this game for a while, because you are just that into it right from the start.I have yet to find a single flaw in this game. Not a single one. This is the second most beautiful game (graphics-wise) I have ever played and seen (Eternal Sonata is number one for me).The controls are smooth and perfect, the weapons are fun and although there aren't very many of them it feels like there is a large selection (their strengths and weaknesses range greatly so there is nothing that extra weapons would add to this).The maps are ridiculously large and free to explore entirely. The game heavily rewards people who explore every bit of the environment, too, because weapons and ammunition are in short supply and if you find a little chest that is hidden in some bushes, then you will be given a LOT of these items (weapons, ammunition, batteries (also very very important), and flash bangs).There are side things to do, such as finding all of the thermoses or watching all of the televisions. They are tricky to find, but it is fun to see the creative places they are hidden.The enemies say the FUNNIEST things. I laughed every single time one would sneak up on me. The first time I heard what one of them said, I was in a basement under some stairs, and one giant guy with an axe jumped at me (in slow-mo) from off the stairs, and he yelled dramatically \"omega-3 fatty acids are good for your heaaaaaart!!!\" Then they will also say \"fishing can be a hobby or a job!!\" So they basically just shout random facts, and personally it was really creative and made the game all the more special.The environment is hard to maneuver sometimes because it is virtually always dark, but I feel like that was deliberate. It makes it creepy and more difficult.I have never been more amused by characters in a game than the ones in here. They always had something funny to say. It lightened the mood of the game, as well, so that the darkness and depression of it isn't horribly overwhelming.One thing that I had trouble with was using the weapons and ammunition. I would always try to save them because they were so hard to come across, and enemies sneak out of nowhere and swarm you. Do not follow in my footsteps, try to use them efficiently. Do not use them all at once, but every so often, you will lose everything you had and have to find more all over again. So what I recommend is playing the first part of the game multiple times until you see exactly how much ammunition and flash bangs you should use in one crowd of enemies. I died quite a few times because I was unable to figure out how to spread out the use of weapons.The bosses were fun to fight and never repetitive. They ending was so thrilling (this \"ending\" I am referring to includes the location right before the final boss, too, because it was just so beautiful), and the story kept me playing it constantly. I spent all of my free time playing it.**This was a long review but this game deserves every positive word I have in the dictionary of my brain. Honestly, there is no reason to not get this game.**","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

It is certainly not a game you want to play.I hear there's even a boss who is an android ANGEL -- is this their way to imply that the messengers of god are droids?

{"product_name":"B00005043P","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for Sega Genesis, no case","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Somewhat truncated as a result of the split","reviewText":"It's no secret that Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were supposed to be one gigantic game but developing time and cartridge ability forced the project to be split into two halves. Back in the 90s I only ever played Sonic and Sonic 2 on my Mega Drive. I remember when Sonic 3 came out in about June 1994. It was out of my price range at the time and by the time I had enough money to invest the Mega Drive was already losing ground to the next-generation consoles so I never bothered.Now that I'm trying to catch up with all the games I missed I am a little bit disappointed with Sonic 3. The first sequel was released to unprecedented hype in the run up to Xmas in 1992, while Sonic 3 seemed to just appear in shops with little to no fanfare.The gameplay is nearly no different from the previous games. Sonic jumps, dashes, spins, accelerates and smashes as usual. The special stages have been changed again. The rotating labyrinths and speedway chases are gone and in their place there is the cruelest, hardest level I've ever played in any video game. Sonic runs around on a giant sphere collecting blue spheres and avoiding red spheres, all in giddy, disorientating faux-3D. It's the kind of thing that provokes seizures. And unless you have the reflexes of a superhuman gunslinger and have a control pad with responses far beyond what the Mega Drive was capable of you'll never, ever manage to succeed at them all.The music is also a bit of step-down from Sonic 1 and 2. Those tunes were catchy and fun, while the tunes in this game are just kinda middling and mediocre. A bit of a missed opportunity.And don't get too excited about the ending. The game just...STOPS. There's no epic climax, no eye-candy, no credits recap. It just ends. I do realize that this is because the game is really only halfway finished but the developers still could have put in something...anything! A cliffhanger perhaps?Despite the disappointment, I'm still looking forward to Sonic & Knuckles. It's got a lot to make up for.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Finally... after all these years","reviewText":"To me, GT5 was the most anticipated game ever and, I must say, I was well prepared for it. Back in July, 2008 I got a taste of the upcoming masterpiece viaGran Turismo 5 Prologue. The entire family had a good time driving around the Ahalf a dozen or so tracks, thanks to the wonderfulLogitech PlayStation 3 Driving Force GT Racing Wheel. GT5 was about to be released 'any day' so, one of Santa's gifts was aPlayseat Limited Edition Forza Motorsport 3 Evolution Racing Seatin 2009. We had lots of fun putting it together and a little more Prologue driving didn't hurt while GT5's delivery dates kept changing.Well... finally, it came. My pre-order, placed on September 21, 2009 was FINALLY fulfilled, more than one year later. Ahhh... the rejoicing. Not surprisingly, the sound of engines roaring has been filling the living room ever since Nov. 26, the day we took delivery. It's been myself, 2 kids, sometimes their friends booking time in front of the big screen TV, racing, managing and maintaining cars, gifting each other needed vehicles, playing videos of our best races for the rest of the family to see, passing or struggling with the increasingly difficult licensing tests, discussing overtaking and cornering techniques, educating ourselves on the finer points of car tuning.And, it's true, GT5 does not have 'everything' and not all is perfect but it has 'a lot' and most of it is done amazingly well. Anyone who doesn't think 1000+ cars is 'a lot', be aware that one of the trophies is awarded for holding 1000 cars in your garage - I know I'll never get that one. The 70+ tracks are more like 50 because the number includes track mods and even the same track raced in reverse but, again, there's enough variety.More on the 'a lot' topic. There's so much to do. My favorite activity is, of course driving but 'racing' is only one option - the GT mode - on the main menu. Like Prologue, GT5 comes with 'GT TV', just in case you feel like watching something and there's not much on your 200+ channels (always the case for me). Then, there is the most intriguing 'course maker', something I must use more, where you can create your own tracks by determining the type of road (gravel, tarmac, ice...) the time of day, number of sections, each section's complexity, weather, time of day and so on. Like I said, I haven't used this option too much. Then, there's the 'arcade mode', if you feel like maybe drifting or racing against a friend in a split screen mode, or racing against computer-controlled cars or just race on your favorite tracks for your best time.The main option in the menu is, of course, the 'GT Mode'. It's where you will see most of the action. It's where your garage with its stable of cars is located and that's where the used and new car dealers can be found as well as the car maintenance and body shop where you can have your car painted or washed, oil changed, and your engine overhauled. Then, there is the separate tuning shop where, for a price, your car can get the mods it needs to win its races. There's so much to do here, I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't spend too much time in the 'practice' section where every single track is available, some under specific weather conditions and times of the day/night. Another section I've only visited sparingly is the 'Special Events' where you can refine your techniques, run kart races or even race WV vans on an airfield runaway (not as easy as it seems).Like its GT4 predecessor, GT5 comes with a license tests. I don't believe that licenses are prerequisites of anything but, besides the trophies and the cars you get whenever you get certified in one class they do give you the opportunity to practice and the six classes of licenses come with 10 tests each so there's a lot to practice and learn there.As for racing itself, the A-spec is divided on 5 levels or 'series', ranging from 'beginner' to 'extreme' with 9 events on each series. Each event can involve racing on one or, so far, 5 different tracks. For example the Granturismo World Championship requires that you race on 5 different tracks, doing as many as 5 laps per track and, once you begin you are not allowed to restart IF you want or win the event's cup - it's probably close to 100 miles worth of racing for this event alone.In GT5, running in a race gets you money, experience points and, if you win an event, some bonus, usually a car - the event I mentioned in the paragraph above will get you an unbelievable 962HP Veyron 16.4 '09 Bugatti monster IF you manage to win the challenge. Experience points are used to level up and you level determines which license classes you can test for, which cars you can buy and on which 'series' you race and which 'special events' you can try out. The higher the series, the more experience points and money you get. You use the money to buy cars, to maintain the cars you have and to buy mods for them. If you don't need a car you can sell it for a lot less than you bought it for or your can 'gift' it to a friend.B-spec involves creating several racers profiles with you playing the manager. I believe that the B-spec events mirror that A-spec's but I haven't played B-spec yet and it's not likely I will do much of it.And, talking about money, some of the cars are insanely expensive. You earn some $200,000 for racing 100 miles and winning the Pro level \"Granturismo World Championship\" which is not a guarantee. Well... a Mark IV Race Car '67 (a Ford) will set you back a cool $20,000,000 and there are many million-dollar cars available for sale at the dealerships. I am not qualified for the Extreme series yet but I hope that they pay a lot there because winning a race in the Expert series gets you about $30,000 and you probably get some half-a-million for winning a championship (5 long races). Well... but that's what should make the GT5 a big challenge for a long time.And I haven't mentioned the Open Lobby section yet, where the online battles take place. Haven't had time or a good enough car for online racing yet but, last time I looked, there were hundreds or races going on there.A few words on the technical merit. GT5 is a fantastic racing simulation. With Logitech's GT wheel you can feel every bump on the road, there are very few video glitches, the surround sound is as real as it gets, tires smoke and leave marks on the pavement when you skid, dirt flies and... yes there is SOME car damage. The car damage is usually in the form of bruised paint and maybe some minor bumper dents but it takes A LOT to get your car dented. When I managed to get the front bumper dislodged I immediately recorded the race and played it back because I couldn't believe it actually happened. Then I called the kids to show them but, incredibly, the second time I played that 'recording', the car looked as good as new. I know that there's a lot of complaining about the AI. It's true. If your car blocks the road or gets stuck in a fence it's possible to have an AI car bump into it over and over and over again. They also tend to follow whatever their 'optimal' route may be. This can be viewed as 'bad' or, if you are trying to improve your skills under 'controlled' circumstances, having the AI behaving predictably may be a good thing. So far, I'm okay with the AI. They aren't the smartest drivers in the world but, on the other hand, I do like winning my races so it's okay if I sometimes cut corners while they follow the driving line. When I'm tired of AI's I'll go online to get beat real good.Still on the technical part. There are, indeed, little flickers and glitches but nothing major so far. A little more annoying is that only a subset of cars, labelled 'premium' have the option of showing their interior while driven. Who knows, maybe future upgrades will add more car interiors to the existing ones. Also, yes, loading times are not instantaneous. I did not mind the hour-long initial installation because it's something that you only do once but I do find it annoying that every time I get into a race I have to wait for 20-30 seconds for that race to load and, if I get out of it to change my car it has to load again.My overall impression, after all these years of waiting is that I'm happy GT5 is finally here. I can't compare it with GT4 because I never played that but GT5 is as fantastic racing experience with a lot of depth and I expect to be playing it for many months if not years to come. By the way, my review did not touch everything in GT5. There is a lot of depth in this game and, after only 2-3 weeks I can't say that I've explored everything. I would call GT5 a definite buy but I would budget for at least a driving wheel and a 'seat' assembly for a truly satisfying experience.______________________________________________NOTE on trophies:Getting the GT5 platinum may not be 'mission impossible' but it comes pretty close to that. You need to win every single race and every special event, which is expected but then... you must earn a trophy for finishing no MORE than 1/100 second ahead of #2. Or... how about filling up your garage with ONE THOUSAND cars? Any idea how much THAT costs? It would be interesting to see how long before the first platinum winner.

Yes it's on the shorter side, but it's one hell of a ride! If your'e more all about multiplayer then you'll be getting more for your money.The game starts off right where the 2nd Killzone left off. Your'e on a quest to get off the planet then find out the Helghast plans for earth. Right when you start the game you'll notice how good this game looks. This game is so good looking it's hard to put into words. And to top it off, there's so much going on around you, it's intense. you definitely get the feeling your'e in the middle of a huge, intense war.I know a lot of people hated Killzone 2 because of the control lag, well this game got it right. I didn't have a problem with the controls on Killzone 2 but KIllzone 3 controls feel very solid and do feel better. The new vehicles were so fun. Jetpacks anyone? And I thought the story was awesome. I heard some people complain about the ending, I thought it was good. It was open ended, so we should be getting another game. But who wasn't expecting that?! And the levels are really well done, they really captured the feel of an intelligent alien civilization. The jungle level is really fun if some of you guys like stealth.I havent played multiplayer yet nor did I try out the move with it, so I can't comment on that. I'll try multiplayer out tonight.The Verdict. If money is tight and you don't care about multiplayer, then I say rent it, just because  the game is short. But if you like multiplayer or have the money to throw around I say definitely pick this up. It's fun, action packed, and great to look at. Buy this already!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002BU0DPE","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"A novel a day\"","summary":"Solid headset.  Physically and Quality-y","reviewText":"First off, I find it slightly amusing that Amazon has the rating system for this gaming headset require the reviewer to rate \"How much fun is this game?\" and \"How do you rate this game overall?\"  Perhaps because this is in the video game section of Amazon, I suppose.  Obviously, I chose 5 stars, though those 5 stars cannot be applied to a concept that is moot in regard to the product, I still want the product to have 5 stars overall.I have only had this headset for a couple weeks.  Since then, however, I have put it to extensive use: I've used this headset for playing Battlefield 3, Uncharted 3, Modern Warfare 3, and I have watched Netflix television shows and movies.  As Uncharted 3 was listed, I think you realize that I have used this for PS3.The Physical:The cord for the headset is plenty long.  The remote is integrated into the cord; there is no chance of losing it.  Except if you lose the cord, which is attached to the headset, then you've lost the entire headset.  Why'd you do that?  The remote not only contains the volume adjustment wheel, but also a chat volume wheel, a bass adjustment wheel, a mute tab, and a surround sound type tab.  The remote also has a clip so that you can clip it on your shirt or something.  The only downnside to the remote, in my experience, is that if you don't clip it to something, as I often do not, and let it lay across your lap or whatever, the volume wheels can be adjusted as you move your body or if the remote falls off your lap to the floor.  I don't mean the wheels adjust via gravity or motion itself, but that your motion may cause your leg to rub against the wheel.  This is entirely the user's fault and didn't effect my rating, but a sudden onslaught of noise is a sudden onslaught of noise.The Quality:This headset is truly phenomenal.  The sound quality is not to be compared.  Well, except perhaps to a very expensive headset, but, who honestly has hundreds of dollars for something like that?  Sadly, not I.  I can hear my enemie's footsteps and incoming vehicles, etc., with ease.  It DOES improve your gaming.  Or, rather, it allows you to become more immersed into whatever game you are playing, increasing your attention to the small details.  And there are details.  You really will never appreciate the sound capabilities of a game like BF3 or UC3 without a headset such as this one to consolidate the sound right into your ear canals.Great value.  I've done a lot of research. So save yourself some time and buy this headset.  =)-Cheeers!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing.

As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

Blizzard","summary":"A Great Game for Those Who Like Open Worlds","reviewText":"It's a fun game but very irritating at times.  If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed, then you will like this.  For some reason, most games that have moral choice have very evil or saintly good with no middle ground.  In this game, you cannot get all the karma powers or gain all the trophies unless you go fully good or fully bad.  Trophies are another thing that can be annoying with the game.  In order to get all trophies, you have to play the game at least twice and make the completely opposite moral choices the second time.  The story is interesting, but you end up fighting the same enemies over and over again.  You also get the same missions over and over again.  The Karma meter is a nice addition with specific power's being unlocked at each level.  One last annoying thing is the way Cole grabs onto things.  Usually, this is good but during timed missions, you will be furiously trying to \"unstick\" him all the while dodging enemy fire or trying to maintain control over the character.It may sound like I did not enjoy the game, but these are, overall, minor issues.  The hordes of enemies and list of powers can make for interesting ways to combat foes, and yes you will be rewarded for your creativity.  There are no pre-rendered FMV's, instead there are very well done, almost comic book, scenes with the occasional 3D sprite thrown in for effect.  The characters add a whole new dimension to the city and will help shape what actions you take.  Although the game is largely repetitive, there is a variety of tasks to perform in the city.  I highly suggest getting this game.  If you can overlook the flaws and bugs (I fell through the city once) you will find a gem of a game that will make you glad to own a PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004XIQMS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Frederick T. Matson \"Freddy J\"","summary":"Great Use of Kinect Capabilities","reviewText":"First off, this game is fun. If you enjoy the horror/survival genre then you will enjoy this. It is a creepy story with creepy characters. The controls work pretty well. Maybe even better than pretty well. Shifting shoulders left or right changes the dirction of your character and is very responsive. It does take a little time to get used to how far to turn or you might over compensate and head in the opposite direction. There are four basic moves: turning, walking, slashing, and interacting with onscreen icons. However, and this is where the surprise and fun comes into play, sometimes you're prompted to run, swim, duck, climb, push, and even rub your arms to remove unwanted leeches. There is such a variation that gameplay is never dull. If people are finding the game unresponsive to their gestures, I can assure you it is because of the conditions they are working with the kinect, not the game. I started it last night and played 90 straight minutes. In those minutes, I actually broke a light sweat and felt some degree of tiredness - the game keeps you moving (and I am an avid runner/cyclist so I don't tire easily). If you're curious how the kinect can deliver a fun first person experience, then look no further. Fun, scary, and extremely interactive.

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Max Renn","summary":"The Move showed promise, but suffered from little support from Sony or third party makers of good games","reviewText":"The Move might be considered a clone of the Wii control scheme, but who cares--it absolutely improves upon Nintendo's initial efforts.  You actually will get a workout from using the Move, especially during movement intensive games like the gladiator duel in Sports Champions.  I absolutely love the gladiator game, even with only one controller.  However, I cannot wait to find another Move controller so I can play the game as it was meant to be played, where you're using both arms to control the sword and shield.  Playing through gladiator's medal challenges will make you sweat, and that's a good thing.  I haven't yet played through all of the games on the disc, but I did try the archery and frisbee games and they were pretty fun.  Some people complain about calibration each time you play a specific game, but so what?  If you want the level of accuracy that Move delivers, you'll put up with a few mere seconds of calibration time before playing.Things I like about the Move:Very responsive and intuitive controls, unlike the Wii, where you just flick a wrist, rather than actually swing your arm when you punch or slice someone.  Depending on how you thrust or swing, your character will act accordingly.No more ugly little Mii's to look at, with their childishly drawn faces and disconnected heads and ball hands.  Ugh.  You actually see nicely rendered, realistic players (in Sports Champions, anyway.  Let's hope dev's don't make a bunch of ugly, crappy shovelware, as they did with the Wii.  I hope Sony QA's the games and forces some standards on PS3 software).No more blurry Wii games, as the PS3 supports HD quality images.One drawback is the cost of the Move.  The bundle was not too extravagantly priced, but if you want to play a fighting game with two players, you may have to pick up three more Move controllers ($50 each), and maybe one or two navigation controls ($30 each).  The games seem to be less expensive--for now anyway.  They're around $40-$50 buck, as opposed to $60 for games where you use the regular controller.Also, I tried to play some demo Move games, and the controller didn't seem to work as well on those.  Might be a problem on my end??  I tried changing the room lights and adjusting the camera tilt, but those fixes didn't seem to work.  Sports Champions, however, was a different story.  Right out of the box, it worked perfectly.Now, if only No More Heroes (one of the best games on the Wii) would hurry up and get released on the PS3.  It will also support Move controls.Update: 2.5 years later, and very few good games support this. I bought a few and the Move options seem kinda tacked on as if as an afterthought on the games I've played. Peripheral support fail on the part of Sony.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

This game is LOADED with bugs, the graphics engine consumes your CPU and RAM no matter how powerful your system is! Please read on - I don't hate this game...I just think they should have tested it before releasing it to the public.There are many fansites with forums. In the forums you will find people screaming and yelling from the rooftops about how bad, buggy and choppy this game is!Let me make myself clear and explain what I mean by BETA for those that do not know.When a software company creates a program it typically goes through several stages before being released. BETA is a version that is ALMOST ready for sale to the public but needs to go through test drives first to hunt and find problems, crashes, bugs, mistakes, etc. This version would not be sold or released to the public for widespread use. NO WAY!A release that is ready for widespread public use or sale is called a GOLD or RTM version. This means that it runs beautifully, very few bugs or crash problems, if any!WELL, Vampires: Bloodlines is NOTHING BUT A BETA!!!!!!!! I can prove it. Keep reading!I have a P4, ATI X800, 2 GB CORSAIR RAM....etc. You name it, I have nothing but top of the line, latest and greatest.This game chugs along. It consumes over 750 MB's of RAM when being run, I get choppy frames, and lots of lag at times!How can this be? Easy, this game was not meant to be released so soon. I think there was pressure to get it out before X-mas!!!! The code and graphics engine behind this game was not ready for retail release.Bloodlines crashes at certain parts of the game, lip sync is off on many characters, some missions of the game cannot be completed, graphics errors and goof ups abound while playing the game, the combat action is TERRIBLE, involuntary switching from 1st to 3rd person disrupts your game play!! I could go on and on!The GOOD -Diverse campaigns/missions, funny interaction with characters, some interesting weapons to use, very creative game with clever ideas and lots of thought put into the concept.The BAD -Missions become repetitive, lots of level transitions that TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD!!!!! Lot's of talking about meaningless things with characters. It almost seems like they added this crap just to keep you busy! The graphics are nice but the characters are stiff and unrealistic looking.The UGLY -Parts of game cannot be completed successfully, parts of game cause you to crash to desktop, there is an unofficial patch but it does not work under many circumstances, slow load times, choppy framerates, music and voice sync is off in many situations. The worst part is the collision detection part of the graphics engine. (Translation -You can be stopped dead in your tracks by a measely drinking cup or piece of chair on the floor while just walking, but worst of all while being shot at or chased!!! Talk about ruining the gameplay experience!!!)This game was not ready for primetime and should never have been released so soon. I think this game will be a good game once an official patch or two have been released and proven successful.Don't buy this game until these issues have been resolved.

I immediately noticed the considerable weight as I lugged off the front porch, my first impression being that there were lots of quality metal tubing and parts inside.  I wasn't wrong.  As I unpacked the box, I saw the kit was already assembled in a folded position, so technically (like the description says) all I needed to do was unfold it, and attach the cymbals and control box (packed separately) in my initial set up, and I could be up and playing in minutes.  The three drum heads were already attached to the crossbar via clamps, but  for some reason, mine were factory-positioned wrong.  Left to right, they were green, blue, red instead of red, blue, green so I had to take them completely off the crossbar and reposition them myself.  Next, I folded out the legs and adjusted the height, then angled up the drum heads into playable position and tightened the clamps.  Unfortunately, this is where I got my first taste of disappointment.  Although sturdy, I found the clamps very hard to tighten to a point where they would not shift around during play.  I still can't tighten them enough.  It's a poor design for such an expensive peripheral, and definitely needs to be addressed.The cymbal holder clamps were likewise already positioned on the crossbar, so I just slipped in the tubular stands, adjusted them to height, and tightened them up.  Again, I found I could not tighten them enough to prevent them from moving around during play.  This is especially annoying with the yellow high-hat cymbal because it just moves constantly when struck until you're completely missing the beat.  Next part of the setup involved attaching the control box to the crossbar holder (clamp already attached), and wiring all the drum heads and cymbals into it.  Luckily, everything is color coded.Lastly, I plugged in the foot pedal.  This is, by far, the weakest part of the kit.  It is, in a word, horrible.  For a prestige drum peripheral, this pedal is shameful.  I can't believe Logitech could not come up with something better than this for their premium kit.  On the plus side, it's a good 15\" in length, so big feet are amply accommodated, and despite the plastic construction, there is a nice chrome inlay with the \"Guitar Hero\" logo.  But it just looks and feels flimsy, the one part of this kit that you immediately think will easily break.Whoever designed the pedal definitely needs to go back to the drawing board.  Aside from the flimsy look and feel, my number one complaint about it is that there is nothing to prevent it from traveling across the floor as you use it, save for my personal fix of putting a cinder block in front of it.  The underside of the pedal has eight half inch rubber spots that are supposed to grip a bare floor.  Or, if you are like me, you can apply the included 2.5 x 1.5\" patch of Velcro in a rather comical attempt to get it to stick to your carpet.  Either way, sans cinder block or likewise anchor, you will be chasing this thing all over the place while yelling colorful phrases at your game.Being wireless, the drum kit syncs as quickly and easily to the Xbox 360 console as you would expect with any other wireless controller.  I did not have any issues getting it connected or staying connected.  I used the in-game calibration to set it up with my individual music games.The drum heads themselves are of quality construction, larger than those found on the stock kits, with a nice bounce and response.  There is a thin colored edge around the red, blue, and green drum heads respectively, and the yellow and orange cymbal have a colored nut on top.  I made a personal change and wired my orange cymbal into the green drum control connector for use with Rock Band titles.  This effectively turned my green drum head (cymbal in my RB1 wired kit) into the orange cymbal on the Logitech kit.  It's quick and easy to switch back for use with Guitar Hero games.The drum heads are not as silent as Logitech might have you believe, so you will have to turn up your TV volume while playing.  As I said earlier, I only have the Rock Band 1 wired kit with which to compare, so I have not used any cymbals prior to trying the Logitech kit.  I really can't say if they are better or worse than other cymbals on the market, but I can say I found them stiff and not very responsive--very unlike real cymbals which move freely when struck--and I would have preferred them to be a full circle instead of a cutout.  I liked that everything was fairly adjustable in the terms of height and angles, so you can really set this kit up to fit you precisely.As a side note, there is no real holder for your drumsticks, although there is a spot you can tuck them on the bars at the back of the drum heads.Overall, I found this kit was constructed of quality materials, but it lacked in its design implementation.  Logitech would have you believe it takes 'seconds' to go from folded storage to fully playable, where actually that time is more like 30 minutes initially, then 5-10 minutes thereafter (my solution is to leave it set up in a corner, and not even bother with the 'folding storage' part).  Even then, you'll be getting up between songs to make adjustments to those crossbar clamps that simply don't tighten enough. In conclusion, I have to say that the Logitech Xbox 360 Wireless Drum Controller is a disappointing effort for this premium price point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"A classic revisited","reviewText":"So, right off the bat, I must say, that Final Fantasy Tactics for PSX is my favorite game of all times. So I hope you understand that this review is quite biased, but, with good measure, I should hope.First off, the bad news: It's true, theres a significant slowdown during battles only, when casting spells (protect takes forever, for example) and special attacks. The sounds and the actions might be out of synch at times as well. Also, there's new content, so far, most of it has had to do with Delita's own story. These scenes feel weird: they do explain thoroughly several plot points that weren't explained in the game's first iteration, but they feel a little bit tacked on to me....still, they serve their purpose, to further Delita and Ovelia's relationship, which is an important plot point that was glossed over the first time. Also, some sounds have been changed, most noticeably, the echo in the death rattles was taken out, and, it's not that it sounds cheap...but it doesn't sound as cool anymore. Some sounds HAVE been downgraded, like some higher level magic spells.  All in all, I don't understand that tradeoff in particular.The good -  very interesting re-write of all the dialogue in the game. It was given the Ivalice-treatment, and characters now have a Shakesperian depth...just by reading them, you know what their station in life is, whether it be noble or not so. Also, the re-write made some of the plot points way clearer than the first time around. The incredibly intricate plot got a new lease on life, really. It makes me wonder what if they re-made Vagrant Story... I digress.  So, the animated cut-scenes are beautiful, and the voice acting is great (not superb, but very good). And some people have complained about the fuzzy graphics. Honestly, I see the same pixelated isometric 2 1/2 D graphics I saw back in '98.The neutral- so, the gameplay is the same: if you've never played it, it might take a while to get a hang of it. The gameplay is quite daunting for even regular gamers, and some people haven't even played it because they could never get a hang of it. Moreover, once you do get the hang of it, it takes a while to truly master it. Theres two new classes: Onion Knight and Dark Knight. The Dark Knight is a pain to get and is totally worth it; the Onion Knight might be worth it later on...there's also a multi-player feature which I haven't tried out yet, sadly.Odd observation, this time around, the odds favor enemies a lot more often...for example, I once cast Haste on myself, with a 97% chance of success. Good as done right? Wrong. The spell missed. And that's just one example. I've been missing enemies with sure shots all the time, like 85% success rate. And yet, long shots, like 35% hits, happen more often this time around as well.  The AI, I feel, is way more goal oriented this time around: enemies will try flanking you or will prefer causing status changes instead of hitting you directly. The archer, which sucked the first time around, is quite useful now, on both sides.All in all, this is a great game, perhaps a bit pricey, considering that Jeanne d'Arc, another great SRPG is out for 10 dollars less. Obviously, two very different games, and, honestly, get both. If you can only get one, get this one. I'm gonna be playing this one for a while. Again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2007"}

N","summary":"Infinitely flawed but I love it","reviewText":"I ran into The 4 Heroes of Light after completing Matrix's earlier reworking of Final Fantasy III on the Nintendo DS. Things started out kind of shaky with that game (the first ten hours reminded me of why we move on from things every now and then but the last twenty hours were enough to make up for it) so with a positive final impression firmly imprinted on my mind I was interested in trying the other products Matrix developed.Enter The 4 Heroes of Light, a product that initially seems unimpressive where ever you look. Music? The game has one of the most befitting yet uninspired scores you'll ever hear. Gameplay? Good, but definitely rooted in the style of old-school RPGs from yesteryear. Truth be told there isn't a single element in this game you can place above the others and you don't have to look far for the flaws (the ill-fated switch in experience systems halfway through, the loss of the awesome and realistic squabbling between characters in the second half, attack options like status effects that ultimately prove to be unattractive and certain attacks and classes proving WAY too useful) but after playing through it twice and even writing my own online FAQ for it I have to say I'm smitten with the game despite it's problems - none of which are insurmountable with an open mind. There's a certain charm imbedded within that's not immediately noticeable and it only came to my attention after beating it and moving on to some other video game based conquests. It's this odd, almost quirky quality that I'm looking for when I play video games, even if the underlying experience is far from inspiring.That said, I'm sure some will question whether or not this game should bear the Final Fantasy moniker. I've pondered the same question considering how SquareEnix slaps the brand on everything these days and in this case I'm not against it; in fact, the game feels a lot like a Final Fantasy Mystic Quest for a new generation. I'll agree that I probably would have enjoyed the game if it not been a Final Fantasy but would I have played it? Probably not as old video game buying habits die hard. Additionally, like Final Fantasy III, 4 Heroes simplicity should not be viewed as a vice. In general, I don't expect games on handhelds to be kingpins of gameplay like their console counterparts and what's present here fits into that mold just fine. This isn't to say a complex game can't be done on a handheld it's just that more straightforward experiences seem to work better on portable systems in my opinion.So despite the fact it's hardly anything special when approached from an unbiased standpoint, The 4 Heroes of Light has more going for it than a simple glance would suggest. The game is more than capable of forging a relationship with the player despite its limitations if given the chance. It's definitely a new classic in my collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPL","description":"Through Jango Fett--father of Boba Fett--players will plunge into the dark, deadly world of a bounty hunter. Inspired by events betweenEpisode IandEpisode II,Star Wars: Bounty Hunterpresents an original, compelling, third-person action experience that establishes Jango Fett's place in theStar Warsgalaxy and his connection to the notorious Clone Army. The game draws players into Jango Fett's sinister and seedy world, where thieves and assassins thrive. Using his cunning and a host of deadly skills, Jango Fett ventures into the rarely explored dark side of theStar Warsuniverse to track down the elusive leader of a mysterious and deadly cult. All the while, he'll compete against a brutal rival from his past in a quest to capture the ultimate bounty, dead or alive.Gameplay emphasizes intense combat and physical action in the relentless pursuit of prey across six fantastic worlds and 18 levels. Jango Fett faces off against an onslaught of the worst scum in the universe, including crime lords, corrupt politicians, and enemies of various species. He is equipped with an arsenal of powerful weapons such as dual blaster pistols, a flamethrower, missiles, and a distinctive jet pack.","reviewerName":"Will","summary":"A Star Wars Game at Heart","reviewText":"Star Wars: Bounty Hunter is a game that could have been much better, although it still provided it's entertainment.  You play as the mercenary Jango Fett and put to use his many weapons including: Dual Blater pistols, flamethrower, poison darts, sniper rifle, whipcord, and his jetpack rocket.  Jango can also zip around using his jetpack.  Although, it doesn't last forever, so when you run out of juice you come back down to the ground and then it recharges itself rather quickly.  The game takes around 12 hours to beat, with about 18 levels in 6 different worlds.  The game follows a great story line based on Jango and highlights of his career.  Like how he got the Slave I and how he became the model for the clone army.  The plot has you collecting bounties for certain people, but in the missions themselves you can collect seconary bounties.  Now this isn't always an easy task.  You first have to scan them to see if there is a price on there head.  Next you have to mark them, then (whether they are wanted dead or alive, or either one)you either kill them or wrap them up with the whipcord.  THEN you have to collect it and normally you do all this under fire from other aliens.  I found myself getting killed quite often while I went through the process of capturing a bounty.  The gameplay also features a new targeting system where you can lock on to two people at once (you can only do this with the dual blaster pistols).  Flying around and shooting things can be really fun at first but eventually it gets a little repetitive.  When there is a lot of action around, the game does not slow up at all.  It pretty much keeps a constant framerate, much to my relief.  The graphics are fairly good, from the speedy laser to Jango's helment.  Some of the enviroments could use some work, especially indoors and in the jungle levels.  This time around Lucasarts has Industrial Light and Magic doing their CGI cutscenes (which look amazing) for them and Skywalker Sound taking care of the audio.  The sound (like most Star Wars games) is excellent.  The laser blasts and music all sounds like Star Wars.  This game could have been better in several different aspects.  The gameplay needs to be improved, but I don't know what...You can't quite put your finger on it but there's something missing.  I also believe that the level design could have been spruced up some more.  All in all I enjoyed Star Wars: Bounty Hunter and its flaws kept me from really loving it.  I really wanted to, but I just can't.  Bounty Hunter would make a great rental for the normal Star Wars fan, but if you're a harcore one, then you might want to hang on to this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2002"}

I never thought that it was possible to have a PC game (with all of the depth and freedom associated with it) on a console until now.For Fallout 1 and 2 vets, this is the closest thing to a modern version of them; Fallout 3 was good but this is much better.The only caveat is WHEN to get this game. If you don't have a lot of time to play games right now or you have a lot of patience to wait even longer, I'd wait until Fall of 2011 when they have the game of the year edition with all the DLC included.Pros:Your choices in-game mean something: Most games give you a linear storyline where you can change 1 or 2 major things, and where a change in one part of the world doesn't affect any other part of the world. This would include Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Grand Theft Auto, and even Fallout 3. While all those games are still way better than the story on rails RPGs (where there's no choice at all), the choices they give you and more importantly their effects to the game world are mostly shallow. In New Vegas on the other hand, what you do in game has immediate and long-term effects. The seemingly little things you do in one place will affect the ending. Each location, group, and even your companions will have multiple endings, ranging from 3 endings up to 12 different endings for just ONE place, group, or character. O yeah what happens in one place, will have a domino effect on other places and groups DURING the game.Freedom: : A lot of games rely on heavy scripting, or rules that cannot be broken. i.e. You can't kill this character, you only have 2 ways to complete this quest, etc... New Vegas gives you so much freedom to complete a quest. For example to make peace between two groups I could either go diplomatic or whack the trouble maker. For the peaceful route, I can either use a favor I have with the gang leader, or talk to 1 of 2 generals in different locations. If I wanted to just whack someone, I could just kill him myself the conventional way (shooting, sneaking a grenade in the pocket), frame another group by stealing his cigs and replacing it with a haha I stole your cigs note, or I could spike his cigs with poison to get the job done.  What makes it even better is that there are a lot of choices that aren't really good or bad; and they just fall in between, where you can't tell what the ultimate outcome will be until the very end. Unfortunately this is also bad, given the complexity it is to implement by the game developers... resulting in lots and lots of bugs.Hybrid FPS: Like Fallout 3, it's great mix of FPS and hybrid turn based combat system.Huge/Good Value: Not even counting the 4 DLC slated to come out, given all the different combinations of things you can do and all of their domino after effects; I would estimate that for a single play through there is easily over 100 hours of game time;0 most likely more. I would guess that you can have 3-7 full play throughs from start to end before it gets boring. I've already restarted like 3 times and each time after the first game, it felt new.Cons:Bugs: This is after all a PC game in all its glory, with the good comes the bad. Not only do you get bugs where quests can't be completed or where you can no longer get a companion, there are also bugs that constantly freeze your game and even prevent you from loading a save game; and this is on a console! From experience, the PS3 version is the buggiest with the PC version (ironically) being the least buggy (mainly because of all the fanboys making their own custom fixes and work arounds really fast). I didn't completely restart some of my games just for the hell of it. O yeah, the kicker is that some of the worst bugs were introduced through patches that were meant to make the game more stable. Sadly this game is so good that even with all the glitches I still can't stop playing. UPDATE: as of today with all the patches, this game runs great. Too bad it didn't ship this in this state.Huge: This is a really horrible time killer. Even after like 10 hours of straight playing, even after you know exactly what you need to do and go; there is still so much to do and people to see. Unless you don't sleep, even one Thanksgiving weekend or Christmas break isn't enough; even if you ignored all your friends and family.Summary:This is a great game that you need to buy. The only question is when.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2011"}

It is one of the best games ever made with a long and excellent single player gameplay and with a great replay value. It has a great and lenghty storyline. Set in the future, the world is in bad shape with martial law almost all cities, there is poverty and famine everywhere, now a plague called grey death has broken out. Besides a great story the player will be given options of what to say everywhere and the story changes the way you play. Like in the first mission you have to take over the terrorist in the statue of liberty, if you killed the terrorist leader then after a few missions someone will take revenge. In another you have to save a girl hostage, if you save her you will be rewarded and if you failed the game will continue it does not say mission failed, restart level, and the game has three great endings. You play J.C.Denton an agent in the unatco with his brother paul. Unatco is an anti terrorist agency, a few missions later you will find out what the agency really is. Denton is a bionic man who can be trained to hack computers, pick locks, use powerfull weapons and even move or swim faster with the nanotech upgrades. Deus Ex's level design is fantastic, You can go anywhere and do anything you want. All the objectives have several approaches to complete, there is always a door you can blow it open with explosives, a door with a lock you can pick, a door with a computerised lock you can hack open ect. The world detail is fantastic, you can turn on the shower, operate the soda machine ect, there are also a lot of secrect passage. Be sure to explore all the places and talk to everyone you see and the crosshair shows green before going to the next level.Deus Ex is very hard game and you upgrade your skills as you play. Players may find the game very frustrating as they will find themselves without enough ammo, multitool or lockpicks, that is mostly because they wasted their inventory. Deusex is a game in which every bullet and other items you use matters. It is also a game to save every minuite, it is better to save before every combat and reload the game if you wasted a lot of inventory items and not only if you got killed. The AI is very bad, but i think it is part of the game, as it is not a game with you as a heavily armed soldier must kill all the smart bad guys and procced to the next level. It is a game which gives you hard choices and second guess every action you do. Only the correct choices will get you past the bad guys even if they are very dumb. Deusex multiplayer is also good, It is a much different experiance from other games, you have to hack computers ect. Deus Ex is built on the unreal tournament engine. I played it on the Direct3D video mode and the game runs very smooth, load times were good. The first version may be optimised only for 3dFx-Glide but this version has a great direct3d code. I played it on direct3d 800x600x32 with detail textures and the game runs fine, opengl support is also quite good. The bad things are, the graphics are not very good, the charecters look very ugly, save games take large disk space. But the great gameplay makes up for it. Deus Ex is one of the best games i have ever played, it deserves the game of the year award. Get Deus Ex, It is the game of the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Shane O. Laake \"camera nerd\"","summary":"A solid, though not spectacular game","reviewText":"When I first heard rumblings about a DJ Hero game, I feared the worst, some bad rehash of Guitar Hero with some new gizmo to clutter up my living room.  On one hand it confirmed my fears (no getting around the new gizmo to clutter the living room), but on the other, DJ Hero does stand up on its own.For anyone who's played Guitar Hero, the controls will quickly instill a deja vu from familiarity to similar functions on the guitar, but all in all the controls on the provided turntable controller aren't too contrived or detached from the experience.  Three fingers on the right hand control the buttons on the turntable (similar to those on the neck of the guitar) itself as well as scratch (comparable to strumming the guitar) as needed.  The left hand handles cross fades (comparable to sliding across the buttons on the neck) as well as controlling euphoria (star power).  The included demo will get all but the most uncoordinated up to speed, with the cross fades being the trickiest element for me.The game itself continues the familiarity for Guitar Hero users, but the ambiance and song selection are unique.  Notes travel towards the player on what appears to be the edge of a huge record (instead of a huge guitar neck).  As you follow along successfully, you can hear the different tracks become one.  The experience is enjoyable, but sometimes it seemed more as if you were a passenger on the journey rather than the driver.  Because of this, I'd rate the experience a notch below Guitar Hero.  Speaking of which, one of the highlights of the game is the inclusion of DJ vs Guitar Hero mode.  Since many people already have a Guitar around, this is a great way to dip into multiplayer).  In addition to this, two players with DJ controllers can play together (or one can simply compare scores with the one) and online play is supported.I like the game, but I really just never got into it enough to love it.  Your mileage will vary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Definitely a must play game","reviewText":"Tomb Raider has been rebooted, as many franchises are doing now, and the result is an enjoyable if not wholly original experience.In this new Tomb Raider, you play as a young Lara Croft, off on her first expedition. Unfortunately for her and her crew, things go horribly wrong as their ship is destroyed by an unnatural storm and they are stranded on a mysterious island inhabited by psychotic cultists. Lara soon learns that it's kill or be killed, and she must take on the roll of hero to save her friends and escape the island. The set up is exciting, and the presentation throughout the game enforces the sense of peril and dread that such a scenario would embody.The beginning of the game is a tutorial of sorts, but there are quite a few QTEs (Quick Time Events) that require timed button presses while watching a cut scene. Many gamers argue that QTEs are not gameplay, and never has that been more apparent than in Tomb Raider. I got sick of the QTEs quick and hoped they would go away soon. Thankfully, after the first hour of the game, the QTEs disappear and don't rear their ugly head again. But if they aren't part of the gameplay mechanics, why are they there in the first place? The game would have benefited from their omission.Once the game opens up, the gameplay is a cross between Batman: Arkham City and Uncharted 3. A lot of the levels are very linear, which like Uncharted, keeps the game tight and focused. You'll jump across a chasm, swing across a poll, grab the side of a cliff, shimmy across to a plank, vault up, then balance-beam walk across it to your destination. The levels are designed so that at first glance everything looks natural, but as you make your way to your destination you'll see the chipped white paint of a climbable ledge, or secured rope to zip-line across. The game gives subtle visual clues that you'll grow to recognize and will aid you in traversing the island. If you've played Uncharted, you know what I'm talking about.The controls are tight and responsive. Lara moves naturally and I rarely had an issue with getting Lara where I wanted her to go. Climbing ledges and scaling rocks felt right. It was fast enough to keep me from feeling bored, but not so fast that Lara felt like a toy. Lara has a sense of weight to her, and the animation and controls make her feel like she's really in the environment. When compared with previous Tomb Raider games, the controls are a welcome improvement.The game also has lots of gunplay. The combat controls feel very similar to Uncharted. You pull the left trigger to aim and the right trigger to shoot, and you can even click the right thumbstick to zoom in a little. Like previous Tomb Raider games, the auto-aim is very strong, which is a blessing and a curse. In one on one combat, it is very easy to quickly pull the left trigger, then immediately pull the right trigger for a very fast kill. But when you're up against 5 or more enemies (as frequently happens later in the game), the auto-aim locks on to the nearest enemy, not who you're pointing at. Several times, I was trying to kill a sniper, but when I pulled the left trigger to aim at him, the auto-aim would pull the camera away from where I was pointing and aim at a guy down below him, because he was slightly closer, even though the sniper posed a more immediate threat. There are also plenty of explosive red barrels (a cliche every shooter game has), but again when I'd point the camera at a barrel, the auto-aim would pull the camera away from it and lock onto the nearest enemy, forcing me to pull the camera back over to the barrel to shoot it. As far as I could tell, there is no option to turn auto-aim off, so whatever help it provides in aiming is negated by the frustration of aiming at the wrong thing. This really only became an issue later in the game at the battles became bigger, but it would have been nice to have the option to turn it off. Also, the auto-aim oddly points at the enemy's bellybutton, making headshots a chore.Like many of today's third person shooters, Lara can take cover behind walls and shoot from cover. Lara takes cover automatically, and it works surprisingly well. 99% of the time the game knows what you're trying to do, but there were a few rare moments where I was hiding on one side of a wall and started getting shot by an enemy I didn't see, so I'd try to walk around to the other side of the wall to take cover, but Lara would just get stuck on the corner and die. This was a rare occurrence, but frustrating nonetheless.When not killing and preforming acrobatics, Lara will solve puzzles. The Tomb Raider series is known for some real head-scratchers, so I was a little disappointed that all of the puzzles in the new Tomb Raider are trivial at best. I never spent more than 2 minutes on a puzzle room, and I'm not exactly a big puzzle guy. I can't imagine anyone who uses even the littlest bit of thought having any issues getting past these. Even the optional tombs in the game have easy puzzles. At the very least, the optional tomb puzzles should have provided the challenge gamers are used to solving in the Tomb Raider series.Taking a page from Batman: Arkham City, Lara will find new weapons and gadgets that will aid her on her adventure. One such item is a bow and arrow that can be fitted with a rope, which Lara can use to climb across chasms or pull down barriers, like Batman's grappling hook. Lara can also use \"Survival Instinct\" with the push of a button, which functions in the same way as Batman's \"Detective Mode\". This will highlight enemies, interactive objects, and your destination. As you find treasure and defeat enemies, Lara will gain experience which will culminate in Skill Points that Lara can spend to learn new skills and moves, like Batman. Through some sections of the game, Lara can sneak around, and if unnoticed, can stealthily dispatch enemies, like Batman. I guess someone on the development team was a Batman fan.The story in Tomb Raider starts out strong, but unfolds in a very straightforward manner until the end. There are some pretty interesting moments in the game, but large explosions do not equate interesting story. Lara herself feels well rounded (no pun intended), but the rest of the cast are painfully one dimensional. Even the villain, who doesn't show up till half-way through the game, doesn't reveal his motivation until near the end, and when you hear it, it's just kind of like, \"Oh, well that's silly.\" There's a sort-of-twist near the end that is foreshadowed so much that it comes as no surprise when it happens, no to mention it's a cliche that many games have used before. If the same level of thought had been applied to the other characters and plot that they gave to Lara, it would be outstanding. As it is, the story is serviceable, but nothing noteworthy.The graphics are a real sight to behold, and are by far the best aspect of the game. There were many times in the game where I would just stop and look at a set piece because it looked so gorgeous. The \"Wow\" factor plays a part in the atmosphere of the game, and the outstanding visuals make those moments genuine. The character models are detailed and their animation is very realistic. The performances of the actors, both the motion capture and their voice performance, are well done. The villain comes across as cartoony, but maybe that was deliberate? Like Uncharted, Tomb Raider is trying to feel like a big summer blockbuster movie. The cinematic camera angles, grand scope, gigantic sets, and constant danger all accomplish this well. There are some scenes in the game where a bridge is crumbling beneath Lara as she runs for her life or a building is burning all around her as she desperately fights for survival. These moments are genuinely thrilling, and the graphics and animation are a big part of that. I recently played Crysis 3 and was amazed at the level of visual fidelity Crytek was able to accomplish on the aging Xbox 360 hardware. Tomb Raider is every bit as visually impressive as Crysis 3, which is really saying something.One thing that caught me off guard: Tomb Raider is a very mature game. In the past, Lara's adventures have been pretty PG-13, but this time around the language and gore are very graphic. There were parts where Lara is crawling through a tunnel filled with severed heads and limbs, or some corpses have their intestines lying next to their body. Also, adult language is thrown around frequently. It fits the atmosphere of the game, but was unexpected in the Tomb Raider franchise. Parents considering this for their kids will want to take this into consideration before purchasing.Tomb Raider is not a perfect game. I didn't like the QTEs, the auto-aim, the simple puzzles, or the half-baked story. But there is a lot more to like than not. The game is exciting, the gameplay is solid, and the presentation is outstanding. Tomb Raider borrows heavily from Batman: Arkham City and Uncharted 3, and although not original, the gameplay works well. Tomb Raider updates an aging franchise, but fails to innovate. The game is streamlined for a more focused experience, but as a result some of the challenge has been removed. Hardcore gamers looking for a real challenge may be disappointed, but everyone else should find something to like. If you're an Xbox gamer and have never played the Uncharted games, this is the closest you'll get to playing Uncharted on the Xbox.I would recommend that everybody play Tomb Raider at least once. Whether to rent it or buy it depends on how much money you have to spend, as the game is short enough to be completed in a weekend. There is multi-player, but I didn't bother with it, and from what I've heard it's not all that great. The single player campaign is a memorable experience and well worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Psychic Cypher","summary":"Fantastic!","reviewText":"This is the most fun I've had in a while. There have been some fantastic games to come out lately, but even some of the best lacked focus in some areas. An example: Far Cry 3. I love that game...it has fantastic gameplay, an engaging story (and great acting), and a huge open world filled with fun stuff to do. But, probably because it's open world, unless you followed the story, it could lack focus. And although I had fun doing everything I did in that game, there were times when my attention &#34;wandered&#34; because there was just so much to do.Tomb Raider is a great example of a focused game. It does what it does really, really well. In fact, I haven't seen a game like this since the last Uncharted...and I'd argue that, while Uncharted 2 is my second favorite game of all-time, TR is better than U3 was...yes, it's that good. And, in many ways, it reminds me of the Uncharted series. Very linear but done in a supremely focused way that allows for excellent story-telling. The gameplay isn't quite as refined as Uncharted, but it's still pretty darn good.It's one of the best looking games on the 360, and it's just plain fun. The acting is excellent, the writing (despite what one joker said in his review) is great, and the pacing is really well-done.When they first started talking about this &#34;reboot&#34;, somehow the term &#34;survival horror&#34; got thrown around, and consequently I had zero interest. I hate survival horror games. Fortunately, that's not remotely how I would describe this game. Basically, I'll say this...if you liked Uncharted, you'll like this. Similar kind of story-telling, similar kind of action gameplay, similar exploration and collection, but adds an upgrade system. If you didn't like Uncharted, well...you may not find this to your liking. As for me, I'm enjoying every minute of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"\"Stay down...\" -Batman","reviewText":"For some reason, I could not get as interested in fighting games as I once was. It's probably because of how my little brother overexposes me to the Street Fighter series (especially Street Fighter x Tekken....ugh..). Fortunately, all is not over for me yet, as there's one fighting game I would totally play time and time again! That fighter is Injustice: Gods Among Us.Injustice is a fighter cut from the Mortal Kombat cloth that breathes DC Comics. More specifically, you play as a DC hero to beat the crap out of the other DC hero. That alone makes for an interesting premise, and it is clothed with a gorgeous and edgy graphical style.Speaking of which, this game manages to do something that I actually wish more fighters would do: Acknowledge the arenas the characters are fighting in. Here's what I mean - Every fighter of this format has arenas that the characters really do not interact with. Every \"level\" would be the same thing with a different coat of paint. Injustice tries going against that by having players interact with certain objects that would otherwise be part of the background! You can knock your opponent against a helicopter, slide a freaking DUMPSTER at him/her, etc. Flashy? Maybe, but it's nevertheless fun to do!The fighting mechanics themselves are pure rock-solid! You can totally feel the fighters' weight, and the control is very fluid. You have a wide array of attacks to use, including but not limited to basic punches and kicks, the background interaction, and the \"Clash system\" that happens only once or twice in battle, in which there's a cutscene-like event occurring onscreen and you need to press a button to bet your meter (The meter builds up as you make combos) in a Rock-Paper-Scissors-style fashion.The very best thing I can think about the gameplay is that even on a difficulty like Hard mode, the AI allows you to make a choice of either button-mashing like a fighting game lunatic or using moves that you genuinely know. The AI never feels too cheap or dumb. It feels juuuust right!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"George Rownd","summary":"Great characters","reviewText":"It is cool to see the plot in all the disney worlds with disney characters. cool levels and the controls are easy. voice acting is awsome compared to castlevania.

Years pass and Bullfrog releases several incarnations of various god games culminating in their rebirth as \"Lionhead\" and the release of \"Black and White\", a PC god game with a tamagotchi pet gimmick. As with most of this company's games, a 'good versus evil' element comes into play allowing the player to choose a path of righteousness.But in their latest release 'Fable', aside from your character's visual appearance, things don't really change much between good and bad. Spells and equipment, as well as armour and weapons are useable equally regardless of your moral alignment. And you will also be able to realign yourself whenever you choose - in fact the game sort of forces you to with some quests requiring adjusting your good alignment and others bad. This in turn, makes the touted 'you decide' factor somewhat moot.So that leaves us with a adventure romp which, whilst initially fun, is so ridden with horrible foibles that I simply gained little enjoyment from it. Sure it looks real purty and the day to night gradual transition is very effective but the game limits you to very specific vicinities - no free roaming here. In fact, even though you can walk in some water, other areas are inexplicably out of bounds - some ponds are surrounded by invisible walls, tiny bonsai bushes are impenetrable. So you're looking at a nice faux postcard whose appearance belies boundaries that have little baring on where you can go. Shame.Sound is great - until a character talks. They have used the most annoying amateurish UK v/o artists imaginable. If you're a Brit it might be fun to hear the regional dialects - but for the rest of us it's incoherent babble. They didn't even confine accents to areas giving off a sense of locale. Instead each character is gifted with a random unattractive nasal twang from regions unknown.Moving from location to location brings up the next most problematic part of Fable. Load times. Areas are specifically loaded - no preloading or streaming. So if you go through a gate, under an arch or pass a tree the loading screen pops up. And stays there. Some areas are no more than a single cave or corridor yet you have to endure the same loading time - often it takes longer for an area to load than it does to travel across. Sure you can teleport to certain important areas but travelling on foot is an exersize in patience. Have something to read with you when playing.The storyline is common fare - family wiped out seemingly with you as the only survivor, you seek revenge of the killer(s) and knowledge from those who raise you. The cutscenes vary from interesting to tedious - most of the dialogue is terrible with unexplainable pausing between delivery. You can skip them of course, but as a player I want to know what's going on, what I'm supposed to do. So I sit there whilst unanimated manniquins talk at you. And boy is it dull -\"Oh there you are (pause)... I thought you were dead (pause)... I'm glad you aren't (pause)... Will you help me (pause)... I think I'll need some help (pause)...\" and on and on and on.Combat is frustrating and magic is unuseable during battle since you can't pause combat to reassess your magic powers or change them to make them more applicable. I completed most of the game with 'Lightening' - I didn't both seeking out alternative powers since Lightening seemed to do the trick and changing spells during a fight was clumsy to the max.So yeah I didn't like it. It wasn't for me. In summation; nothing new here and vastly overhyped and simply not that much fun.Sorry Bullfrog but Populous is turning over in its 80s grave.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Stays true while adding more to the MGS series","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence is a remake of the 2004 smash hit Snake Eater by Konami, but with some added goodies. This is cool because Subsistence manages to clear up the confusing storyline of the Metal Gear games, yet manages to set in motion that very same confusion. Superb.The story of Subsistence/Snake Eater is pretty intense, and would take some time to understand & explain. To put it simply, your character Jack (codenamed Snake but later earns the famous title of Big Boss used throughout the rest of the MG titles) has to basically stop an all terrain nuclear missile launching vehicle named the Shagohod and kill his former mentor who was not only defected but was being blamed for a nuclear attack on a small research facility in Russia. While on that mission he uncovers a huge & complex conspiracy that entertwines the Soviet Union, China, and the United States which affects later games in the Metal Gear saga. You just \\have to play the game to really appreciate the story.The ending of the game will surley touch & play upon your emotions, guarenteed. I actually felt bad ffor Jack when he had to finally take on his old teacher & comrade Big Boss.The graphics in this game are absolutley some of the best I have seen in any video game. From thick dense jungles, caves, to military complexs all look nearly lifelike - sometimes it is hard to differenctiate between reality and just a video game. The cut scenes look amazing, so much detail was done to each and every character - from hair lengths, eye movements, body language - help to give all characters a unique personality and also help to let the player connect to a certain character. Take when Jack was being tortured by Volgin: I literally felt every blow Jack suffered by the hands of his tourmenter, and felt that I must give Jack the revenge he deserves against this mad man. The Shagohod itself is absolutley a must see..The music in this game is just like every other Metal Gear - perfect. However, unlike Twin Snakes or Sons of Liberty, this game has more acoustic songs which really help to create an atmosphere of peace & love at times, especially in the FMV sequences of Jack & EVA. Also, Subsistence/Snake Eater has it's own theme song which sounds like something from a James Bond movie... so yeah, it helps add to that whole \"stealthy spy\" feeling the game is meant to have. Not to mention it just sounds nice to hear.Its hard to compare Subsistence to any of the other Metal Gear games because it really has it's own style. Sure it has the same idea of being stealthy and quiet while finding weapons & only using them as a last resort, and taking down bad guys. What truley seperates this title from the others are the following: you must find, use, and combine different styles of camo to remain hidden (hence the whole 1 to 2 hour learning curve). Hunt and eat food such as mushrooms, mangos, rabits, and obviously snakes to keep you're stamina up. Take care of wounds you sustain in the battlefield from cuts, burns & broken bones, to hornet stings and food poisioning by using bandages, splints, ointment, serums, etc. A new \"free roaming\" camera angle that the player can control unlike the \"fixed overhead\" camera found in the other games. A mini game involving the monkies from Ape Escape. Two old NES Metal Gear games (one that wasn't even released in America). And finally, online capabilities.To begin, if you have the network adapter for the PS2, you can download new uniforms & face paints to use in-game. Now, for the first time ever, you can challenge other players around the world to either join a team deathmatch, team capture the \"Kerotan\" (which is this little frog thing..its basically a capture the flag sort of game), free for all deathmatch, or a \"Sneaking\" game which pits one person playing as Snake against an army of soldiers while trying to capture a Microfilm & bring it back to one of two bases. You can choose a bunch of weapons like a shotgun, handguns, greneades, porn mags, and other items. Along with that you can choose the music you wish to hear (that includes music from the two NES games found in Subsistence, boss battles from Snake Eater, and music from all Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty).In this game you will see some familiar faces. Some you may like and be interested in, like the young Revolver Ocelot... and some that you MAY not like... like a character who not only looks like MGS 2's Raiden, but is plainly seen as Volgin's man-lover.Replay value of the game is high only because there is so many things to unlock, different routes to go, different ways to defeat enemies (like draining their stamina instead of actually killing them).. you get the idea.To sum it up, you NEED to get Metal Gear Solid: Subsistence. I highly recomend it both for its single player campaign & online capabilities.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The greatest parody in video gaming history","reviewText":"3D Dot Game Heroes may simultaneously be the most original and most unoriginal game I've ever played. How is that possible? Well, it should be obvious to anybody who looks at the game for more than five minutes. It's clearly a homage of the gaming of yesteryear, particularly the classic Legend of Zelda NES and SNES games (A Link to the Pastin particular). In fact, it's pretty much an exact copy of the formula of A Link to the Past. You won't find anything in the gameplay that is any different whatsoever to that old classic. The story is essentially the same, the gadgets and weapons are the same, the dungeons are the same, the enemies are the same. You get the idea. However, there are things that set 3D Dot Game Heroes in a league of its own.The game starts on a spectacular note. The hilarious story pokes fun at itself, telling us the king of the land has decreed Dotnia, a classical SNES 2-D Kingdom, needs to upgrade to 3-D to attract tourists. Now there's an evil bishop who is foolishly going to release the ancient evil Ganonlike menace and it's up to you to go collect the orbs of the sages, locked away in dungeons, to save the day.Again, it's totally derivative of the classic adventure games. However, there's so much reverence for the source material, combined with a tremendous amount of gut-busting humor, that it's all amazing. English is purposefully marred (collect a life enhancing \"heart\" and a box comes on screen \"LIFE UP GET\" C'mon, that's hilarious), references to famous gaffs in classic games (\"I am error\"), and lots of tongue in cheek jokes from the game designers themselves (come across a dead body \"He's dead\" scribbled on the wall \"My run command failed...\"). It's amazingly well done, and enjoyably from start to finish. It is to Zelda whatSpaceballsis toStar Wars, a loving parody. Yet, it's also a loving salute. There are numerous nods to classics like Final Fantasy, Mega Man, Fire Emblem, Bionic Commando, evenDemon's Souls(which was made by the same company). It's all quite grand.The game's art direction is fantastic. Every thing is made up \"dots\" which basically makes everything look like a classic 8-bit NES game come to life in 3-D. The lens effect enhances everything in the game. The draw distance is small and anything far away blurs, which makes the whole thing look as if we're looking at children's toys come to life in their own diorama world. It's quite spectacular. The lighting effects are awesome too. Enemies explode with light and shower the scene with their individual pixel pieces. It's awesome. The music is also great, with 8-bit synthesizers taking the show, harkening back to the awesome 8-bit anthems of Mega Man and Zelda.The gameplay is exactly like A Link to the Past. If you've played that, then you know exactly what to expect. You go to a series of dungeons spread across an overworld, getting access to newer areas previously blocked as you acquire new gadgets. The big bosses of gaming yesteryear are present and a blast. 3D Dot's gameplay succeeds hugely because it so lovingly and blatantly copies it from some of the past's very best gaming offerings. It's great.Also worth mentioning is a feature that allows you to build your own hero to play as in the game. You make him in a series of poses, and then can play him or her in your game. There are dozens of heroes included with the game, and if you have the time, artistic ability, and patience, there are limitless possibilities as to what your hero will look like. It's really cool and adds tons of customization to the game. You can even download other people's creations on Atlus' website, put them on a USB drive, and put them onto your system and play as them. I've seen numerous creative ideas, from recreations of all iterations of Link's history, to an 8-bit Master Chief, to a half-eaten taco, to recreations of Mega Man, to all sorts of original creations. It's really neat.Is 3D Dot Game Heroes for you? Well, it really depends. If you grew up playing the NES, SNES, Genesis, Saturn, and other consoles of yesteryear, you'll absolutely adore what 3D Dot Game Heroes has to offer. It copies the best elements of the best action adventure games of the past, while still coming across as the most unique, fresh idea in video games in years. It really is an amazing little gem. A sense of humor is required to play this game, and that is a great thing. Buy it, adore it, and get lost in the glory of video games history.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0009S4UOA","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"COD2 is packed with awesome WW2 action..","reviewText":"Call of Duty 2 puts you in the role of three different people - Vasili, John Davis, and Bill Taylor - during three highly intense but different WW2 campaigns.You see the war through each of these soldiers eyes, so in otherwords, its a first person shooter. Anyway, you get a lot of authentic WW2 weapons which include Panzershreks, MP40s, M1 Garands, Thompsons, etc and you get to shoot and blow up things like Halftracks and Tiger Tanks. Ontop of that, you get smoke & frag grenades to toss around at will. There is a multiplayer which is pretty fun - you pick a team (ie: British, Nazis, Americans..you get it) and go toe to toe with a friend or friends in random places that has WW2 history.The objectives in each level sually require you to either clear out houses room by room, snipe out mortar teams, fend off a massive German counterattack, or place a bomb on something. Its pretty fun and intense because you'll be fighting off wave after wave of Nazis and artillery while trying to achieve your goal, but it becomes sorta repetitive during the later levels..I want to stress the word \"intense\" on this game. You will always be on your toes, always firing at hordes of enemies. This game isn't easy, even on the easy difficulty, and is ridiculously hard on the Veteran difficulty. The hardest in my opinion is the American campaign during the battle of Point Du Heuc... if you think Medal of Honor: Frontline's Arnhem Knights level is difficult, wait till you see this. Also, this game is pretty long so don't try rushing it hah.Moving on, you'll be fighting in very detailed and wartorn areas such as Egypt, France, Russia, and even Germany. I was impressed with the beautiful looking enviroments when up close, and the character models look amazing. However, the levels feel kind of linear. You are pretty limited as to where you can go, but I guess we can look past that.The sound effects were great - I really loved the explosions. The voice acting was great, and actually helpful because your allies would be like \"Kraut on the 2nd floor, black building\" and basically point out enemies to you.What lowered this game from being a 9? Well for starters its in a genre that has been basically played to death. Ontop of that the guns weren't very accurate nor did some of them seem very powerful. I felt ripped off when I shot a guy with the BAR and he just sort of kelled over, got up and shot me again. Meh. Also, like I mentioned, the objectives started to get repetitive.The ending was kind of a rip off at first - a simple news reel explaining how the Allies won - but once the credits roll, the real ending begins. It shows a bunch of troops battling it out in some destroyed city againt tanks, nazis, and airplanes. It was like watching a movie.To sum it all up, if you got an X-Box 360 then you need to play this game. It isn't the best in my opinion, but it sure is a lot of fun. Go buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00002SVG2","description":"InDonkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, the second installment of this superb series, you wage battle against Kaptain K. Rool and his vast army of Kremlings. The incredible Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM) graphics in this game have been specially optimized for the Game Boy. If you play this game with the Super Game Boy accessory for the Super NES, you'll have access to specially selected color palettes and custom border graphics.As the story begins, K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong, and he's demanding the entire Banana Hoard as ransom. It's up to Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong to rescue their kidnapped pal. A wild assortment of friendly animals like Rambi the Rhino, Squitter the Spider, Squawks the Parrot, Rattly the Rattlesnake, and Enguarde the Swordfish help the two little monkeys in their adventurous mission through over 40 levels. Each exciting area is filled with special traps, hidden items, and dastardly Kremlings.People who have playedDonkey Kong Country 2on the Super NES will recognize many of the elements of this game. For example, Diddy Kong can do his signature cartwheel, and Dixie Kong can do her helicopter hair spin. And, you'll need to collect Kremcoins to be able to pass Klubba's Kiosk and get on to the Lost World. But, unlike the game's Super NES counterpart, one character cannot throw the other, and it's only a one-player game. Of course, you can always pause the game and hand it to a friend if you want some two-player fun!","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Even Better Than The Impressive Original","reviewText":"The original &#34;Donkey Kong Country&#34; game was such a success that it pretty much usurped Mario on the SNES console for the title of &#34;best side-scrolling adventure&#34;.  This sequel, &#34;Diddy's Kong Quest&#34;, however, manages to even improve upon the gameplay of its predecessor and make for an even better gaming experience.There are two main reasons why this game is better than the original:1. The level designs manage to be even more interesting.  Not that the levels in &#34;DK1&#34; were bad, by any means, but they are just more interesting in this effort.  When I think back to the iconic levels in this series, I'm usually thinking of ones from this game.2. Dixie Kong is a better playable character than Donkey Kong.  The main trouble with the DK/Diddy combo of part one is that DK is such a sluggish character.  He &#34;gets the job done&#34;, but only passably for a game that requires so much jumping.  In that game, Diddy is the much better character.  In part two, though, the Diddy/Dixie combination are pretty much equals.  Diddy is still a bit more agile and nimble to work with, but the hair of Dixie (used for flying and throwing) makes her very valuable as well.The only reason I can't give this game the full five stars?  It doesn't let you save after every level.  I know, I know...gamers weren't used to that feature like they are now.  But it still doesn't make it any better (at least for me).  After about the second stage, the levels in this game get quite difficult.  Difficult to the point of the gamer feeling a real accomplishment after completing a level (which of course is the point!).  Yet, there is a clunky system of gathering coins in order to save (and even then it is only after you reach the &#34;save point&#34; in each stage).  You may have to beat 3-4 VERY difficult stages (often with only a few lives to work with) in order to save your progress.  I don't care what the &#34;times&#34; were like...that makes for more frustration and less fun.Overall, though, &#34;Diddy's Kong Quest&#34; manages to slide in slightly ahead of its predecessor (no easy feat).  I always had a bit more fun playing this game than the first one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2014"}

These new gameplay elements are mostly for the worse, however, as most of them are obviously rushed and seem to be in the game only to take up space.The flight missions themselves are usually good, but are still greatly lacking depth, length, and anything actually 'new' compared to the other Rogue games.The co-op mode, however, is the games' saving grace which lets you and a partner play through all the original Rogue Leader levels together, with added difficulty and enemies. On the other hand, this is only useful provided you always have someone to play with. And obviously, many people do not, and for them Rebel Strike is a rental at best.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua","summary":"First impressions of the Deluxe WiiU -- Very enjoyable!","reviewText":"Having been a student for many years, the Wii U is the first console that I've ever pre-ordered.  Now I've got a job that has something resembling a salary.  Having gotten so many years of fun and excitement out of my first-gen Wii, I decided to roll the dice on the Wii U by pre-ordering the 32 GB black deluxe set.  So far, I'm glad that I did.  This is a review of the Deluxe set that I've ordered specifically, however you can compare the two sets and fill in the blanks concerning what you may be missing with the basic setWhat is (and isn't) included:The black deluxe set comes with (almost) everything that you need to get started.  It comes with the black console, power brick, sensor bar, HDMI cable (if you need component you'll have to pick it up separately), stand, tablet, tablet charger and dock, a plastic stand for the tablet, and the packaged-in game NintendoLand.  What the game does not come with is one or more wii remotes.  If you already have a Wii, you'll be able to use your current remotes.  If you don't have wii motion plus enabled remotes, you will need to pick up a set of wii motion plus dongles in order to use them (at least for the game I've tried, which I will get into later).Setup:Set up is pretty easy, although you may have to wait a bit (at least close to release day).  Setting up the tablet controller, wires, internet, etc. was a breeze.  Internet setup was standard.  The system recognized the HDMI connection and selected the correct resolution and aspect ratio immediately.  Yes, you now have the ability to play the new Wii games in HD like the rest of the world ; )  I understand the cost reasons related to the SD choice on the Wii, but for most Nintendo fans these days I suspect that the upgrade is going to be a nice change of pace.Before playing any games I can tell that I'm going to like the tablet a bit.  Even during set-up you can tell that the tablet is well integrated with the overall use of the system.  At times the tablet display mirrors the TV content, and at others you see something different on the tablet screen while you are working.  The resolution, colors, and refresh rate of the tablet are all rather pleasing on the eyes.  The screen is touch sensitive, allowing you to interact with the tablet and games with both a press of the screen and the press of a button.  Hidden away in the back is a stylus, which is a nice touch.  I like being able to keep the screen clean while I'm playing with it.One word of warning: You may want to bring a book along (at least at first)--the initial setup required two downloads to be made over the internet.  The first was for the system itself, and the second was after I inserted the first game.  The tablet showed the progress bar while the initial update was downloading, and it took at least 15 minutes for me to see any real progress.  I switched to another activity for a while and eventually came back when the tablet alerted me that the download was finished.  This is most likely going to be an early adopter problem--I suspect since today is the release date that Nintendo's servers are getting slammed.Once setup is complete you're greeted by the Wii U main screen.  While the 3D organization is different from the Wii, you should figure out navigation fairly quickly.  One of the options is a standard Wii view, which appears to give you access to the original Wii OS for navigation and applications (very cool, I look forward to figuring out how to port over my apps and data from my old Wii).Just like the original Wii, you create Mii avatars.  This time you can use the tablet controller's built-in camera to create them for you.  After selecting hair and eye color, you can snap a shot of yourself.  The system configures several miis for you to choose from.  It automatically recognized my glasses, and gave me an option to add my full beard to my mii (making avatar selection much quicker than before).If you choose, you can also set up the tablet as a RF remote that controls all of the other devices in your media center.  This is a nice feature, and is quick to configure.  I selected my TV brand (Vizio), and the first remote configuration that I tried worked right out of the box.In order to use many of the Wii U's features you'll need to create an ID for the new Nintendo Network.  This in turn requires you to configure (among other things) a unique ID (that it says you cannot change), regional info, birthdate, etc.  If you are uncomfortable providing this information you may have to limit the features that you're able to use.  Personally, I don't care so it isn't a problem (they don't need phone, SSN, or anything that I felt was terribly invasive).NintendoLand & first impressions of gaming experience:The packaged-in disc for NintendoLand seems to serve the same purpose as Wii Sports did for the original Wii--to demonstrate how to use the features of the new system and show the user how to use the system's hardware and software.  While Sports was ultimately very simplistic in graphics and purpose, it ended up being a lot of fun for most Wii users.  Despite its relative simplicity, NintendoLand has a very similar feel, and it may be enjoyable for some time to come.In NintendoLand you are greeted by Monita, a floating screen with a single arm.  Monita shows you around the NintendoLand system, and introduces you to the tablet's controls as well as the mini games that are available to you.  Mini games include fan favorites such as Metroid, Link, Mario, Yoshi, Pikmin, and several others.  Despite the fact that I've already picked up two other games (which I will review later) my wife and I have been playing NintendoLand for several hours.  It is a lot of fun.  The interaction with the wii plus remote and nun chuck are (not surprisingly) very similar to the predecessor system, so I'm not going to go to deep into those features here.The tablet provides a real gem here.  Various games have different requirements--at least one tablet, at least one remote, just remotes, remotes and tablet, etc.  Multiplayer games that include both remote and tablet (for at least two users, of course) are a lot of fun.  No longer are you restricted to just one view on the TV or a split-screened view used in previous systems.  Now one user can use the TV as a primary display while the other user can use the mobile screen of the tablet as well as the larger display of their TV.  Simply put, the table offers exactly what you would expect--a combination of the benefits of a handheld with the benefits of a full console experience.  It is simultaneously interesting and difficult to describe without trying it.I've got to say, NintendoLand's combination of remote and tablet make me excited for future games.  I have a feeling that we're just scratching the surface of what the combo can do.  Hopefully game makers use their imagination and provide a new and unique gaming experience the same way that the Wii remotes changed the way that we view console I/O in the previous generation.As a whole, NintendoLand is a great game offering firsts person shooter, puzzles, and more.As a media center:One of the things that Nintendo seems to be trying to do with the new system is tie together the media center the same way that the Wii did seemingly by accident.  The tablet serves as a remote for your devices, the system gives you the ability to play games, and the system also comes preloaded with the biggest streaming players: Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. I have currently tested the Netflix application and it seems to work quite well.  Otherwise, they do exactly what you would expect.  As a streaming player, the Wii U works just fine and the tablet controller (again) makes for a great remote.Overall:If my 5 star rating doesn't speak for itself, I am definitely excited by the prospects of this new system.  As far as I can tell with my initial interactions, Nintendo may have hit another home run.  This last statement is worth qualifying, because as far as I can see all of the potential of the predecessor is here--it will just be a matter of Nintendo and other game makers living up to that promise.  I can't wait to see what else the WIi U has in store for the future.  (Especially the not-yet-deployed TVii feature.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIYLC","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Time to get down and dirty","reviewText":"These are the experiences I have been waiting to have on my PS3.  When I originally saw this game nearly two years ago I was gasping for breath.  Although the final version has come pretty close.  This game is really for everyone because it's plain fun.  Whether you have been playing race games your whole life or you are new to gaming.  The point of the game is to get dirty.Although this game has a limited amount of tracks it's what you can do on the tracks that makes it amazing.  There is almost no limit to the options on each track.  Finding the most suitable course for your vehicle is the challenge.  I find myself almost pausing the game just to view the detail.  The detail from the vehicles and the environment.  For a first generation PS3 game this leaves me wondering graphically how it can be one upped.  Everything in this game is amazing actually almost incredible.Now I have talked about the mud and now I will talk some more.  Obviously you vehicle will be dirty and the only way to play against the opponents is dirty.  That is another reason to be careful of the vehicles you do choose.  What keep this game so challenging is that on easy course you may be up against atv's and Big Rigs.  You don't realize how intimidating that is until they are trying to ram you into a canyon wall.  Although with a little boost you can muster your way out.  What makes having a motorcycle or atv fun is the hand gestures and punching your character will do to their opponents.  Although it's not always good to get the guy driving the Big Rig mad as he will come after you.What I have found is that single player is one of the most challenging gaming experiences I have had.  There is no easy level just as there is no hard.  As you advance in the game the challenge only becomes harder and harder.  The game gives you four levels and each level comprises of tickets.  Now each one of those tickets has one to four races on it.  The object is to finish each ticket.  This is what keeps the game a steady challenge.  Some of the races just seem odd as you are in a motorcycle taking on Big Rigs.  It may seem intimidating but that's where you learn your skills.Now if single player gets a little tough or if you fly through it there is always online.  The online setup allows for 12 racers.  What keeps this a lot of fun is the constant challenge.  As now you are racing against people.  Although what I have found is the computer A.I. is some of the most advanced in any game.  So sometimes taking on people can be a bit easier.  That will be for you to see.In closing I would say this is an obvious fit for anyone who owns a PS3.  This is the type of game that will leave you wanting more.  Evolution studios has done a good enough job to keep everyone in the game...Get out there and Motorstorm.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2007"}

What you CAN do, however, is have the track itself attack your opponents. Construction equipment flies out of control. Parts of the course fall apart. Buildings blow up. And, occasionally, shortcuts pop up.It is one of the most visually beautiful games on the market. Framerate is rock solid, even with a metric ton of crap going on on-screen all of the time. The tracks blow the heck up regularly and thoroughly. The sense of speed is real and extremely visceral. The sheer scope of the destruction that is unleashed routinely is truly amazing.But, the game has problems. Significant ones. First, there aren't a lot of tracks, so you'll see the same things a lot. Some of the game types seem to be too random to be fun (races where you have to dodge missile attacks while driving is just annoying). It's also WAY too random. True, you can avoid most attacks if you're lucky, but there are few ways to see them coming and they happen A LOT as the race goes on. It helps that the game is heavily reliant upon rubber band AI, but it doesn't eliminate the problems.In the end, I cannot help but compare the games and, well, Blur is a better game than Split/Second.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

Also, Clank is seeing strange creatures called Zoni that no one else can see.  The story in this game revolves around Ratchet and Clank working to stop Tachyon and finding out what really happened to the Lombaxes.  And what do those Zoni want with Clank?If you didn't know, \"Ratchet and Clank\" games consist of exploring a variety of different planets and using different neat weapons to kill enemies (such as rockets or even a gun that shoots tornadoes).  There are also various gadgets you can use to get through areas, such as the usual Swingshot and even a disguise to make you look like a space pirate.  The games all have interesting stories, lots of humor, and great voice acting, as well.New to this game are devices, which are items kind of in between weapons and gadgets.  They are used in battle, but they aren't always quite weapons.  The Groovitron distracts enemies by making them dance.  The Transmorpher turns them into penguins for a limited time.  Mr. Zurkon is a bit more of a weapon, as he's a little robot that attacks enemies and insults them.  He's my favorite because his comments can be rather funny.In addition to the usual gameplay with Ratchet, there are a few other things you can do, too.  In this game, you still can occasionally control Clank, like you could in the previous games.  His gameplay is mostly the same as before, with slight changes.  Instead of little robots doing stuff for him, the Zoni help Clank.  Not only do they attack enemies, but they also can fix things and allow Clank to levitate short distances and slow time for as long as he needs.  There are also some fun areas where you fly in space and shoot at things.  You aren't free to fly where you want like in the past, as the ship flies around the area itself, but you can move around on the screen and shoot at various enemies and other things.  There aren't tons of these Clank or flying levels, but they are fun.I would like to point out that this game makes use of the PS3 controller's ability to control things by tilting the controller more than any other game I've played so far.  Sometimes you can tilt the controller to do things like control Clank's geo-laser or control Ratchet when he's falling from high up or for controlling the tornadoes from one of Ratchet's guns (the latter of which I find very hard to control, though).  I think this can be fun, but I'd usually rather just use a control stick for most of these things.  I do think it's quite fun to use when you're flying using Clank's wings, though.  And the best use of the tilting is when you use the Decryptor, and you tilt the controller to tilt this stage and move the ball so it completes gaps in this circuit board for a spark to cross.  I enjoy those areas quite a bit, and I think it was a great way to use the controller like that.While this is a great game, it does have one big problem (which made me give it four stars instead of five).  You may have issues with the dialogue in this game.  Not everyone gets it, but I certainly did.  Characters often repeat words during cut scenes, and the dialogue may also play a second or so late, so the characters' mouths don't move with what they're saying, and I even had a cut scene get so far behind that it ended in the middle of a character's sentence.  I also had a cut scene with no sound whatsoever.  I looked into the issue, and it seems to be something that some people get and some people don't.  And some people even reported not getting it on their first playthrough, but they did on their second.  I was relieved there is nothing wrong with my PS3, but it is very disappointing the usually entertaining cut scenes are a bit ruined by these issues.  You'll very likely want to have the subtitles on so you can read what the characters are supposed to be saying if you do have problems.  That was the only way I knew what was happening during the particularly bad ones.So overall, this is a very good game, and if you like the other games, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one, as it's quite similar to the original three on the PS2.  Other than the audio issues, of course.  If you're new to the series, why not give it a try?  It is a lot of fun.  Due to the audio issues, though, you may want to start off with some of the other \"Ratchet and Clank\" games, such as the original three (there's an HD Collection of all three for the PS3).  They're not much different, but less glitchy.  Nevertheless, this is definitely a good game, and I think anyone could enjoy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Fun with a few problems","reviewText":"Although the front cover says otherwise, I can't help but compare Dead Rising with the movie Dawn of the Dead. The fact is you can do anything you want in a mall. Personally when I think of a mall, I think of Dawn of the Dead, and Dead Rising sort of allows me to play out my fantasy.Dead Rising is one of the most unique Zombie games out there. Capcom is truly the master of Zombies games much like how George Romero is the master of Zombies on the big screen.To explain Dead Rising, think Grand Theft Auto meets Resident Evil. The game's world is limited to a mall, but don't worry, there's plenty to do at the mall. If you want a comparison, think of a huge mall with roller coasters, grocery stores, toy stores, movie theaters, and all other wonderful things you'll find at the mall.In Dead Rising you play a journalist named Frank whose love for the latest story lands him in a town overrun by zombies. The most unique thing about Dead Rising is that you can choose what to do. You are given basically three days of play, and within those three days you can uncover the story of the zombie plague, help survivors to safety, create chaos by killing zombies left and right, stop psychos, or you can do a combination of all.Dead Rising unique system doesn't end with the fact that you can choose how you want to spend your 72 hours, but also the fact that you can choose how you want to defend yourself from the zombie plague. Do you want to bust TV's over zombies head? You can do that. Do you want to pick up an umbrella and use it as a ram to plow zombies? You can do that. Do you want to pick up chainsaws and cut zombies in half? You can do that. Pretty much anything can be used as a weapon in this game... right down to pies and foam bats and can sodas.Overall a fun game to play for any zombie fan. There are few minor problems with the game which includes the fact that on some TVs it will be hard to read the text on the screen. I highly recommend playing the game on HDTV otherwise you'll be having a hard time reading the text on standard TV although I heard for some people it isn't a factor. Ironically on the front cover of the game, the main character has a standard TV to break over the zombies head... perhaps it is a precursor to the fact that you'll be doing that to your TV when you are overrun by anger.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2008"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A truly stunning achievement","reviewText":"Unlike many others here, Fallout 3 is my introduction to the series.  That being said, knowing nearly nothing about either of the previous games other than what I've read and heard, Fallout 3 stands on its own as a truly stunning achievement.  Journeying through the wasteland of Washington DC, you are searching for your missing father, and that's where I'll leave you as far as the game's story goes.  Needless to say, there is a lot going on in the world of Fallout 3, and the longer you play it, the more you will realize this.  Everything about the game just screams epic: there are intricate quests in which your decisions truly can change the course of the direction the game will go, making for some incredibly deep gameplay that will have you coming back even after you've completed the game the first time.  The freedom to explore what and when you want doesn't hurt either, and the game's setting and visuals really are sights to behold.  Fallout 3 also very much earns its Mature rating, and features some brutal violence in its already tense encounters.  As a whole, Fallout 3 is gorgeous looking and sounds incredible, and the game's shifts of first and third person perspectives play better than many other games to use either presentation.  All in all, Fallout 3 is a brilliant, stunning achievement that deserves your attention, regardless of whether you are a veteran to the Fallout series, or are a newcomer like me, there is just so, so much here to behold.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Do not fear death","reviewText":"Dark Souls, much like its glorious predecessor Demon's Souls, is an incredibly rich, nuanced, and ultimately fun game that hides behind an extremely dark, sharp exterior.  Everything in the game exists to get you killed.  Quite literally any single foe can kill you at whatever level you are, particularly if you get sloppy or just have the bad luck of getting knocked off a platform, triple teamed, or just stabbed in the back.  But by the same token, if you learn from your missteps, plan ahead, and become proficient at certain playing styles or tactics, you can go very far even with a level 1 character.  The game rewards patience, persistence, and varying your tactics.  A seemingly insurmountable problem is usually only that way because you are trying to tackle it the wrong way; if a dragon has taken over a bridge, see if there is another way past.  If an armored boar is patrolling a hallway, perhaps there is a way to get the drop on him.  Paying attention to your surroundings and always watching your back is the the best way to at least minimize deaths.Ahh, death.  Dark Souls will kill you, over and over.  There are no multiple save files or re-dos (unless you cheese out and do a hard quit, which usually doesn't work anyway).  When you die, you respawn at a nearby campfire, in a \"hollow\"/undead form and absent all the soul money you may have built up from killing enemies.  If you can make it back to the place where you died, you can recover souls and Humanity, but if not it is lost forever.  And since you likely died in a new area where you were meeting new foes, it can often be challenging to get back safely to where you were.  However, this dynamic is not quite as punishing as it seems.  First of all, everyone dies in Dark Souls, all the time.  Indeed, you will often encounter bloodstains you can activate to get a glimpse of the last few moments of the life of someone else playing online.  Near campfires, you will often see the ghostly apparitions of other online players as they struggle with the same challenges you face.  And if you are lucky, you can even find glowing white symbols that let you summon usually helpful online allies to battle foes with you (you can also be invaded by online enemy players if you are in Human form).  This creates an odd sense of camraderie despite the fact that most areas consist of just you against the world, because regardless of how frustrating and/or embarrasing your latest death was, pretty soon you will see a replay of someone else experiencing something even worse.Second, death can actually be a tactic.  Your character will keep anything you manage to pick up before you die, aside from souls/Humanity.  This means if you are already Hollow from an earlier death and have little soul wealth, dying really doesn't do anything to you.  Suicide runs into dangerous territory can be a great way to collect rare items and equipment and jumpstart your character, trigger switches, or simply scout the area a few times to get a sense of where all the enemies congregate before you commit to actually battling them.Dark Souls is also an extremely detailed and layered game.  Beyond the amazing 3-D environment, which is riddled with hidden passageways, shortcuts, and elaborate zones, there is an extensive interplay between the NPCs you run into, the loot you can find, and even the boss monsters.  Missing a chat with a wandering NPC or even failing to kill them at the right time can cause you to miss a piece of loot forever, and many items are either extremely obscure or can only be upgraded by certain items.  Playing Dark Souls in many ways resembles trying to play a scavenger hunt orchestrated by a lunatic while many of the other contestants are also trying to kill you.  At the same time, triumphing over those odds brings a kind of gratification that you will not find in any other game.  In addition, many tactics that work against computer enemies may be ineffective against human invaders, and vice-versa.  It may well take you several \"practice\" characters and some time with a good walkthrough to figure out what play style you prefer and what items you need to pick up.  But the great cruelty of Dark Souls is also its greatest asset:  just as you can be killed by anyone on a bad day, you can kill anyone on a good day.  Don't let the daunting foes and overpowered player killer invaders stop you from experiencing one of the best games the PS3 has ever seen.  I promise you, you won't remember the deaths, but you will remember the victories.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

You can't get into the game play because there's a cut scene every two minutes or so. Most of them have nothing to do with where you are fighting so they seem terribly misplaced and you just don't really care enough about the characters to WANT to watch them. This game is way too concerned about being an animated movie rather than an actual game.-The aiming system is shot and you cannot lock onto enemies the way you should be able to. If this had been fixed, this could have at least been an average game.-The same goes for the camera, you never face the direction you want to face and that immediately gives this game the score that I've chosen for it.I love Final Fantasy VII for the ps1.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner.

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"stephen Garry","summary":"Something Original","reviewText":"Crazy Taxi has got to be one of the most original games that i have ever played.

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"Peter","summary":"Great game but probably a disappointment to the pregame hype","reviewText":"I'll be the first to admit that I bought in to the pregame hype surrounding Return to Castle Wolfenstein's release.  When the developers released their &quot;Storm the Beaches of Normandy&quot; level as a free multiplayer demo, they released what was probably one of the funnest online action multiplayer levels ever.  While the new multiplayer levels included in the full version do not disappoint, after playing them for some time, they don't seem to have the same replay value as the beach demo that was released.Return to Castle Wolfenstein surrounds a WWII theme of Nazis and the occult.  It comes with two versions: single player and multiplayer.  The singler player version is an adventure in the mold of Indiana Jones and your solo American G.I. must battle Nazis, zombies and witches.  The single player version has various missions with different objectives.  In one mission, you must eliminate a specific person, in the next you must infiltrate a Nazi compound while not being detected and in another you can find yourself searching for a lost archaelogical relic that will prevent the Nazis from obtaining power.  The single player missions are great fun and there are many weapons that are aquired throughout the levels with more lethal weapons available in the later levels.  Impressive weapons such as several sniper rifles, flamethrowers and a few others either invented by the programmers or in theme with the WWII atmosphere.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein allows fun gameplay elements such as sneaking up on Nazis in the middle of top secret conversations or fighting your way through levels with a knife to avoid making noises that will alert other guards.  Probably the biggest complaint I have about the single player levels is that there aren't many included on the CD and it's over before you know it.The second version available in Return to Castle Wolfenstein is the multiplayer mode and it comes with eight maps that you can play via the internet with other gamers.  The best thing about Return to Castle Wolfenstein's multiplayer mode is the teamwork required.  Most team formats in FPS games have the same type of soldiers with the same weapons available for all players. Not so in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. You must pick a class of soldier to play (soldier, lieutenant, medic and engineer) which reflects the weapons you are permitted and the special abilities you can use. Some classes start with more ammunition. Each class has a specific function in the multiplayer map you pick and must be used in unison with other players and their chosen classes to complete the team's objectives. While medics might be reviving fallen comrades, lieutenants can call airstrikes on enemy positions, soldiers can use flamethrowers to sniff out enemy bunkers, engineers arm dynamite to blow up strategic walls, etc...If the price of Return to Castle Wolfenstein was lower, I'd give it five stars in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, the price was set by the game's developers to reflect the instant demand for a game hyped such as this.  Amazon.Com is actually one of the cheaper sources for Wolfenstein as I've seen retail stores that charge as high as sixty dollars for this long awaited sequel.The price shouldn't be an issue though if the game's developers follow through with some of their promises to release many more multiplayer maps and an official map editor that will allow gamers to create their own maps.  Already, websites have started releasing utilities for this game and it looks like it will have a healthy amount of mods (Modifications that either create or change new levels and gameplay elements.), new mulitplayer maps and other creative programs developed by fans around the world.Not a poor game by any means but I think PC gamers were expecting a little bit more for the price.  If you haven't done it already, download the free multiplayer demo available on the internet to see how fun the gameplay can be.  A game that is fun and entertaining and promises to be much more after the developers and fans have created many more new features for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2001"}

A pile of dog poo.  You may get to walk through a pretty yard and play with a few decent toys, but it's not worth the cost of admission and the nasty smell that will follow you around for awhile.

The newer Resident Evil games, as fun as they are, have moved away from horror into more \"action thriller\" areas.  Similar to what the reviewer wrote a few reviews below mine, the last game to really, truly scare me was Silent Hill 2 on the PS2.  I imagine it's quite challenging to make a video game that delivers true horror, just like it must be difficult to make a film or write a book that does the same.  Dead Space, however, not only delivers the terror in spades, but also delivers a game with great gameplay, incredible atmosphere, a movie-worthy story, and pulse pounding action.First things first...this game is scary.  Aside from the moments Isaac (your character) spends in the game's insta-shops and upgrade stations, every moment spent moving through the corridors of the starship Ishimura will have you on edge.  You are in a constant state of nervousness and vulnerability, as you can be attacked by the horrific Necromorphs at any time, and your resources, while powerful and useful, are very limited, so you must make the most of everything.  The game's terrific presentation only amplifies this.  The graphics are vivid and detailed, and creepy sounds echo from all angles.  Along with Bioshock, this game uses sound more effectively than any other game I've played this generation to create mood.  Soft whispers, hints of distant movements, and creaking metal give way to violent shrieks, blasts and explosions in an instant.  There is no time to rest.  The game won't let you.  It is an intense experience.Thankfully, the frightening atmosphere is supported by well executed gameplay.  The control scheme closely resembles that of Resident Evil 4.  This works well for this type of game, as it limits your direct view to an over-the-shoulder third person angle, and adds to the tension since you can't see everything around you all the time.  It's very easy to master and soon you will be dismembering your horrifying enemies in glorious, gory fashion.  The action is fast and furious, and is made even more intense by the periods of edgy calm that come in between.  The menus are all simple to navigate and work well, including the level maps that are given to you at the start of each chapter.  The weapons feel tough and meaty.  The zero-gravity areas are a mind trip and cause you to quickly re-adjust the way you perceive the task at hand, and the mechanics for these areas worked great.  From a control perspective, everything worked well.  To someone new to the survival horror genre, movement and control might seem a bit limited at first, especially when compared to other games.  But you'll quickly realize that for a game like this, where so much is about the unknown and the unseen, the scheme is perfect for bringing out the most out of the chilling atmosphere, and really makes the whole experience more immersive.In addition to the superb graphics and sound, the presentation of the game is rounded off beautifully by a really good story.  The plot details unfold slowly as Isaac discovers audio and text logs that detail what happened on board the Ishimura and the intriguing and disturbing details begin to unfold.  The few other characters in the game are very well written and voice acted.  Overall, it's just a really well put together game that is a lot of fun to play.  Of course, this is a horror game, and a very effective one, so it's obviously not for every taste.  The game's intensity and constant aura of terror might be too much for someone who doesn't enjoy this sort of thing.  But survival horror fans who loved both the not-knowing-what's-around-the-corner creepiness of the original Resident Evil, and the disturbing psychological uneasiness that Silent Hill delivered, will be in heaven here.  It's obvious that lots of time and care was spent to deliver a true, effective survival horror experience, and Dead Space is a resounding success across all fronts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001GGO1GG","reviewerName":"M. Su \"More Dessert\"","summary":"A bit repetitive, but still fun.  Worth renting to try.","reviewText":"Here's the situation, I have played GTA4 all the way thru.  This is the 4th day of playing Godfather II, did not play the 1st one.  This is obviously a similar game to GTA, it's not as deep, but the focus on action does make it a nice play 1 hour here & there game.Character creation:  It's fairly detailed, you can customize the look any way you want.  The one thing I didn't get is you get to choose 7 or 8 styles of clothing, but you end up only wearing only 1.  There's formal, casual, sporty, etc, thought you would be able to change it up in the game. So far, don't see it.Fighting:  This is more action oriented than GTA.  Just a few hours into the game, already got all the available guns.  There's plenty of ammo, plenty of reloads, and the health meter regenerates fast.  The hide & aim controls aren't as tight as GTA, easier to just run in and gun em down.  Maybe in the later stages it gets harder.Driving:  The controls are identicle to GTA, so that was easy to learn.  Each unique car doesn't feel as different, but back in the 40's, maybe that's just the way the cars are.Camera:  This gave me a bit of trouble.  When running around in the room, the camera can't keep up, often ends up in bad angles, and you have no idea who is shooting you.  Fortunately you have plenty of health and it regenerates fast enough you have time to take a few shots and look around.Voice / Music:  The voice acting and music is fine.  I'm one of the few that didn't watch Godfather all the way thru, so can't really comment on how it compares to the movie.  Playing this game already made me buy the blue-ray Godfather set and plan to watch it this weekend.Missions:  The missions are a bit more dull than GTA.  Although the main idea is the same, it's either driving or killing, GTA does make it much more sophisticated.  In here, you basically go in the place, kill most guards, find owner ( this can get frustrating as some are hard to find due to the bad camera), take over, defend.  The variation comes in the way you kill.  Some nice finish move animations.Control:  One thing I must point out is this game lacks JUMP!  Some obstacles gets really frustrating when there is a tiny little ledge and you can't jump over it.  Yes, it does have a vault in some areas, but it can't be used everywhere.  Otherwise, this game's controls are about the same as GTA, so if you played GTA, it'll be easy transition.Overall:  For the casual gamer, this is fine.  It's not that hard, pickup & play for a hour, a bit repetitive but still fun.  I'm not good at FPS, prefers RPGs / Strategy games, so this game suits me good.  Has RPG / Strategy elements, and the action is easy enough for me to handle.  For hardcord gamers this might be too easy / repetitive.  Still, even if you don't buy, it deserves at least a rental to try it out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2009"}

In particular, Final Fantasy was once revered as one of the greatest JRPG franchises of all time.  In recent years Final Fantasy has had something of a mixed reputation.  So, in fact, has Square-Enix.  Yet Bravely Default comes as a surprise.  It harkens back to what made Square so great in the first place.  It is an old school RPG right down to the core.  If you were a fan of Final Fantasy back in the days when they were known as Squaresoft instead of Square-Enix, you may very well love Bravely Default.  It's overall a fun game.There isn't much to keep track of in terms of story in Bravely Default.  Compared to the rest of the game, it's fairly simple and straightforward.  You control a band of adventurers who are out on a quest to revive the four crystals.  If you're familiar with Final Fantasy this is all pretty familiar and straightforward.  The good news is that the cast of characters are actually quite likable.  You'll meet them all pretty early on in your quest.  The story may not be what will entice you about Bravely Default.  Though the characters are likable there are quite a few &#34;by the book,&#34; moments.  Rather what is likely to excite you about Bravely Default is the battle system.The battle system in Bravely Default is a good one.  It's a simple turn based affair.  Your allies on one side of the screen while your enemies populate another.  What separates this battle system from others is the Brave/Default mechanic.  Every character has a set of BP.  Those who choose to Brave can expend them and get an extra turn during combat.  The sacrifice is that if BP drops into the negatives they lose the chance to attack the next turn.  If you default, however, you'll store BP that you can choose to expend or not within the following turn.  So let's just say you decide to default for a turn.  The next turn, you'll have an extra BP which will allow you take one extra action.  And it can be anything.  Utilizing this system you could say... prepare for a powerful attack by having a character default and then the next turn they could attack AND heal if they wanted to.  You can play around with the system in many ways.  If you keep defaulting until your BP is maxed out you can perform several actions in a turn.  A mix of healing, boosting stats and attacking can be done by every character if you so choose.This is more than just a gimmick.  The game's battle system has been designed around this mechanic.  Bravely Default is not an easy game.  You can't simply ignore the Brave/Default mechanic and hope to win in the traditional sense.  In some fights, for example, attacking twice is probably going to be the best way to defeat an enemy who insists on healing.  You may find in some battles the need to boost your defenses before launching into attacks.  The enemies sometimes hit hard.  Bravely Default is not going to hold your hand through it, either.  Comprehending and mastering the battle system is key to getting through Bravely Default.  If you don't take the time to really get it down the game is happy to punish you for it.The job system is in play here as well.  Final Fantasy fans who played through Final Fantasy V will instantly recognize and understand the system.  You'll select a job which already has its own innate abilities.  Black mages cast black magic, white mages heal while warriors are apt fighters and ninjas are fast.  Final Fantasy veterans will know all this stuff already.  As you master abilities, however, you'll be able to mix and match.  So it's possible to have a black mage that will also know white magic if you're trying to build a good sorcerer.  In many games with a job system there are plenty of ways to take advantage of it and learn the best abilities and just keep going with those.  Bravely Default isn't always like that.  In many cases you'll find yourself forced to rethink your strategy against a powerful boss every now and then.  Mixing and matching abilities gives the game a lot of customization.  This isn't like so many RPGs with a job system where you can find a good set and keep it going for nearly the entire game.  Bravely Default has such a wide variety of ways to customize your party that you'll probably want to experiment and learn as many abilities as you can to build up the best party that you can.Of course doing all that involves grinding.  And this is where Bravely Default certainly shows its old school charm the best.  A lot of JRPGs are designed in such a way now that you can coax through them with ease.  They're balanced in a way that the levels typically tend to come around as you go.  Bravely Default doesn't do this.  There are times when you'll need to spend LONG periods of time grinding.  Either to learn abilities with jobs or to gain levels.  You'll often take a break from the story to do this.  In part because Bravely Default demands it.The good news is that the game is rarely that punishing and you can actually choose the pace at which you grind.  You can speed up battles to make them go faster if you want (or select a handy auto-battle command that actually serves you well).  The best part, however, is that if you're feeling tired from grinding or battling and just need a break, you can set how high or low the encounter rate is.  This is something the JRPG has probably needed for a long time.  No abilities, accessories or items necessary to it either.  You can always go into the configuration and set the random encounter rate to 0%.  This is especially nice if you ever find yourself backtracking or just exploring a dungeon for the sake of exploring.  For those looking for a challenge you can also opt to turn off experience, gold and job point rewards.  There really doesn't seem to be any real point to this other than for the hardcore JRPGer who likes to challenge himself or herself.It's nearly impossible to talk about Bravely Default without mentioning Final Fantasy.  The game itself is most definitely a spiritual successor to the famed franchise.  It deals with the elemental crystals and the job system is ripped straight out of FInal Fantasy V.  Many spell names sound very familiar and the graphics and art style are reminiscent of the remakes of Final Fantasy III and IV.  And it all makes for a glorious package.  Bravely Default is a beautiful game through and through.  The world is lively and feels alive.  There's plenty to explore and a lot of things to do.  It'll probably keep you busy for hours on end.  The music is also very good.  It's a game that easy on the eyes and the ears.The only thing that might keep Bravely Default down is that the old school charms aren't for everyone.  The story is fairly slow going at times and is also pretty predictable.  The emphasis here is definitely more on the gameplay, exploration and grinding than it is the actually story at hand.  That doesn't mean the story is actually bad.  It just means that Bravely Default plays it straight.  Likewise, some gamers aren't going to like the emphasis the game will put on grinding.  Especially when it comes to earning abilities  The game makes the process of mastering a job take a long time.  And with so many classes to choose from you'll be busy for a while learning abilities.  For some gamers this is the charm that some of us have to come to appreciate from the genre over time.  For others it might be seen as a way to pad out the length of the game.  Indeed, a lot of hours spend on Bravely Default will come from you running around looking for a battle.Neverthless, I still happen to think this is primarily why Bravely Default works.  It is a game that knows its audience.  And knows them very well.  If you are fan of the JRPG and you've got a 3DS and you loved Final Fantasy, then Bravely Default is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2014"}

When it arrived in the mail I was blown away by the presentation of the product and the details of the case itself. This was very much worth the extra money and I wish more games came with stuff like this. Included is a card with a serial number for the first DLC and I definitely plan on playing it... well worth the purchase. Get it.As far as the game itself is concerned, besides some nitpicking on my part on the combat, the game is amazing. I'm not crazy about the dodge mechanics but I'm sure a lot of people out there will actually love it. The game is scary and playing it in the dark, by yourself, is a thrill ride. The graphics are amazing although some of the character animations can seem a little stiff at times.If you own a 360 and haven't ordered this game already then you're missing out.

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Probably my last CoD purchase.","reviewText":"Another year has passed, which means that the hype machine for the next Call of Duty game has come and gone. All the snazzy marketing that we have come to expect over the years, trailers, spots with celebrities, multiple reveals, and the obligatory 2 hour special live multiplayer streams. With all the glitz and pizazz one would think that everything there is to know about the game, an alert gamer would know, that's not the case. It shouldn't really come as a surprise, but through the genius of marketing, gamers were only shown a very controlled portion of the game. That's to be expected to a point, but I did not know to what degree until I played the game.Campaign mode is pretty much what gamers have come to expect from a Call of Duty game. Large set pieces litter the missions one after another, with a few twists and turns thrown in for good measure. But largely, there's nothing Earth shattering or anything that will have you sitting back and just saying \"Wow.\"  You have your requisite super evil villain and a few brave soldiers who take on an Army. Campaign missions in Black Ops 2 take part in either in the year 2025 or in the year 1986, being split up in order to follow the Mason family. Fans will remember that Alex Mason was a main character in the original Black Ops, and in Black Ops 2 his son David Mason plays a key role also. It is an interesting concept in theory, yet execution of the concept is lacking. In the past I have enjoyed Call of Duty campaigns, yet this one felt like a mash-up of a variety of levels just to showcase `new' features and game-play mechanics.As a result the campaign feels choppy and disjointed, and there is very little real flow or pacing to it. In past campaigns I developed at least a modicum of interest in events and characters, not the case in this one. It quickly became a mind-numbing exercise just to get done with it. During the course of the story Treyarch decided it would be wise to add `side missions' called Strike Force missions. They play out like a poorly designed Command & Conquer or Tom Clancy's End War mission. While they are optional, they further added to the overall fragmented feel. This is the first Call of Duty game I have played where I was underwhelmed by the campaign experience.The mode that put Treyarch on the map of many gamers makes a return. I am of course speaking of Zombies. In World at War, Zombies was a little mode hidden for those who finished the campaign. It quickly became popular and was a normal inclusion when map packs were released. In Black Ops it played an even more significant role, and was a major selling point. In Black Ops 2, there are three separate Zombie modes. Survival - which is the traditional horde mode - the simple goal of staying alive as long as you can. Tranzit mode, which puts a group of four people in a bus station with little notice of what they need to do other than survive. The third mode is Grief mode, which see's two groups of four try to not only outlast each other, but to outscore each other.I will be the first to admit that I have never been as enamored as others have about the prospect of playing Zombies. To me it has always been a slight diversion from either playing the campaign or the multiplayer mode. With that said, of the time I have spent playing Zombies in Black Ops 2, Tranzit is a pretty interesting new addition. It's predicated on the player experimenting and trying to find things. Granted, just a little bit more direction as to what I am supposed to do would be helpful. I'm not sure of the value of having to watch three separate YouTube videos in order to have a general idea of what I should be doing. But Grief mode was not an enjoyable experience for me. There is no time limit, so theoretically, games can go on for hours and hours. I am all for long engaging games, but having a long mode just for the sake of having it doesn't make much sense or carry much value.The last mode is the one that most gamers will get Call of Duty for; multiplayer. Multiplayer in Call of Duty is the meat of the game; it's where most players will spend a majority of their time. In the past, Call of Duty games have followed the same successful formula that was introduced in Call of Duty 4. I read a lot of articles, and watched a lot of trailers leading up to the release of this game and thought I had a good understanding of what to expect. I read a lot of promises made by David Vonderhaar , Game Design Director at Treyarch, about what Black Ops 2 would be. Yet, I realized everything I read and saw up to the point of release day was carefully planned to give false assumptions.For starters, gone is the traditional Create a Class system. Yes, there is still a Create a Class, but now with the added element it has a Pick 10 setup. You essentially have ten slots to use however you want to build your classes. In theory it's an interesting idea and allows players to tailor their classes to their play style. This idea and concept has already been ruined by people making `Knife' classes. This class involves selecting five or six perks and equipping a knife as the secondary. The class basically allows users to run through shock charges, flash bangs, and lunge through gunfire to get cheap and easy kills. Almost every public game there is at least one or two people doing this. Some would say, just shoot them. But it's not so simple in practice, when half your bullets get hit markers and do not register as causing damage. It's been a cause of much frustration while playing the multiplayer.Unfortunately, frustration seems to be the theme with multiplayer. Two things I was hoping would be fixed with the latest iteration of the franchise were not only not fixed, they were enhanced. Those would be Drop Shotting and Quick Scoping. Most know these terms and despise them. Drop Shotting, engaging in a fire fight with someone only to have them lay prone (while shooting) to get a cheap kill. I have long said going to prone there should be a one second delay on when you can fire. Lying down in the middle of a gun fight should not be a valid or easily abused tactic. Quick scoping is using the auto aim mechanic to get guaranteed one hit kills while using a sniper rifle. Again, I am frustrated that this is a tactic that is still allowed to exist in a game, especially when its plagued each iteration of the series for years.Another addition that Treyarch promoted heavily is League Play. Get matched up against players of similar skill and work your way up ladders to be top in your group. Again, another idea that is good in theory and had potential to make things a little more competitive. They even added the ability to stream live, league play games. Unfortunately with all the `improvements' that Treyarch supposedly added, they used the same net coding as prior games. If you are in a League Play game and someone is streaming it, expect every person in the lobby to have a red bar connection and skipping across the screen. The most disappointing aspect of League Play, you cannot pick the specific game mode you want. So, for a gamer like me enjoys Kill Confirmed, Team Deathmatch and Hardpoint, well I may get to play them. But, I'll also be forced to play Capture the Flag, Search and Destroy, Demolition and whatever else pops up. Once you are in a room and the mode is locked in, there is no backing out. If you leave early, you are placed on Probation. Leave again, and you are prevented from playing for a set amount of time. Personally, I got the achievement for playing this mode but am done with it. I will never play it again.The last thing that Treyarch wanted to make sure people knew about was CoD Casting and the eSports setup available in the game. Streaming content, doing commentaries, etc. is now all available from the games menus. Following and watching Mr. Vonderhaar's social media interactions leads me to believe that he is catering to a very select group of people. Many of the additions and changes made to the Call of Duty formula this year were inspired by the so called `Major League Gaming' crowd. Treyarch essentially robbed Peter to please Paul. The normal casual gamer was thrown to the wayside to make sure that the `hardcore' `pro' gamer had things they wanted. I am left feeling that Treyarch spent so much time and effort into pleasing that niche group that they completely ignored what true fans liked and enjoyed from past games.I have been a Call of Duty fan for quite a while now. I have defended the series at times, and spent countless hours playing with friends online. Yet, even I can see that Black Ops 2 is not the game it could have been. I am all for innovation and change, as long as there is a clear and discernible reason to change and it's change for the better. One complaint that many gamers have is frustration that Call of Duty has not ungraded their gaming engine. Mr. Vonderhaar has said that the engine now is nowhere near what it was to start. Just because you paint a car red to cover up the rusty blue, doesn't make it vastly different. At its core it's the same game engine that was present in Call of Duty 4. It's really as simple as that. Until the Call of Duty franchise realizes that they need to upgrade that engine the franchise will become more and more stagnant, as is becoming more and more evident each year.Even with all of its faults I still wanted to like Black Ops 2. I have played Call of Duty every year since Call of Duty 4. It's a habit, my friends all have it, and it's easy to pick up and play. Yet, gaming should be fun and relaxing, with its myriad of issues and flaws I don't know how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it. I have certainly gotten my fair share of frustration though. In today's video game market where there are any number of options to play games need to take into account their core market and fans. Mr. Vonderhaar has chosen to ignore the core fans and cater to a select group which has left me feeling alienated and ignored. I simply do not enjoy this game. There are numerous other games in my collection that I can play for fun and get more enjoyment out of. I am not sure I will be adding another Call of Duty game to that collection.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Beautiful Deviance","reviewText":"With every successive entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, there's always an attempt to bring something a bit new to the table.  While GTA V does have new features, it's really hard to pick any one thing that stands out head and shoulders above the rest:  there's just so much here!  The world is massive.  Like Skyrim, you can go just about anywhere, even out swimming in the ocean to that small strand of islands, or up over the top of a hill that in other games would eventually run you into a bounding box.  It's simply amazing how big Rockstar has been able to make the sandbox.  The graphics are astounding, and on the PS3, I feel like I'm watching Sony's dearly-paid-for hardware finally giving you its all.  Sunlight, ocean waves, the physics of fire and water...even the camera-shake of being too close to an explosion seem just about right.Then there's the people.  There is a ton of recorded dialogue in the game, from some top-notch voice talent.  Even random conversations overheard are fairly well fleshed out, if short.  Even though it's not perfect yet, people still behave a lot more normally than I expected this time around:  they'll argue or fight with each other, get in wrecks, or just have a lot of road rage that they're eager to share.  Events unfold in the GTA world of Los Santos, CA and it seems like it doesn't matter whether you're there or not.  There are small random bits, like witnessing a pickpocket, where you have the opportunity to do something.  There are slightly bigger events, where you might meet a new contact just because you happened to be in the right place at the right time.  And then we have the fact that this world is no longer a single-character experience:  in GTA V, you can switch to other characters fairly much at will.  In a mission, you might switch to another team member (even your dog!).  Outside the mission, the main story of the game introduces you to multiple characters, and you can advance the story for each as you please.  An interesting touch is that when you're not 'moving' the other characters, they're probably going on about their lives, and so as you jump into one, they could be doing anything.If there are any barriers in GTA V, it's the proverbial \"Fourth Wall\", and Rockstar North is knocking furiously to break it down.  In-game, there is a stock market, and you can use your money to buy and sell--and tip the scales with your actions!  Out of game, there is a downloadable app (\"iFruit\" - available for iPhone, coming any day now for Android) that will let you manage your characters a bit.  It has a mini-game you can use to train your dog, and lets you view screenshots, including your own.  \"Screenshots\" is a clever example of the game-reality interaction:  when you're in-game, the way you take a screen shot is to bring up your phone, choose the camera, and take a picture.  If you have a Rockstar Social Club account (required for iFruit), you can connect with your friends.Gameplay for GTA V is slightly improved, but can take some getting used to.  The aiming mechanisms in GTA IV were very difficult for me, so I like the new 'snap-to-target' behavior of the right stick when in aiming mode.  However, the reticle is a tiny white dot that can be hard to track, and there are times you pull hard enough on the stick that it snaps to the target and bounces onwards before you can stop.  The driving interface is still awkward, but now we have a nice bonus from the San Andreas days:  with everything you do, it gets better.  Go practice at the gun range ($14, unlimited ammo, many weapons supplied for you).  Drive around in different vehicles.  Run, sprint, and swim.  Your skills will get better, and things really do get noticeably easier.There have been a couple of bugs for me, but not major ones--I've had my main car duplicate itself and I've heard that some people have lost vehicles between saves.If you're already a fan of the series and you're on the fence about buying GTA V at its opening price point, I highly recommend taking the plunge.  Prepare to lose your time, but also expect to see a lot of hard work in this title, showcasing about as good as gaming gets.  If you're new to the GTA series, there is a LOT to take in here, but I feel like the game still does a good job of gradually getting you there, feeding you bits of features as they go.  It should be said that this game is rated 'M' for Mature, and that's a hard 'M':  I've been exposed to a lot of games, movies, music, etc. over the years and GTA V has been one of those experiences that at times can be hard to take.Either way, Grand Theft Auto V is not to be missed.  I am not surprised it has already sold over a billion dollars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher J. Martin","summary":"Max is back with a Vengeance","reviewText":"When I first heard about this game and that Rockstar would be developing it instead of the original developers at Remedy and then saw Rockstar's bald headed version of Max I worried if this game would capture the noir style I so loved in the original Max Payne and Max Payne 2. I'm happy to say that this game perfectly captured what I love about the Max Payne story.In this game Max has left the United States in an attempt to basically run away from his \"issues\" surrounding the death of his family and his failed relationship with femme fatale Mona Sax. He's now working as private security for a wealthy family in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This new setting is a lot different than the previous two games, it's not as dark and foreboding as New York but I liked it. Putting Max in the middle of events in the Sao Paulo favelas that he doesn't at first have anything to do with is a nice twist.One of the major elements of the first two games is back, Max's internal monologues. Those monologues in the first two games are what let players get to know Max. In this game he's extremely cynical and even more mentally messed up than in the first two games. The fact he's a flawed character I think is what made him likable. However I think in this game Rockstar almost over did it with the cynicism.The missions are linear and straightforward...see bad guy, shoot bad guy. The inclusion of Max's signature \"Bullet Time\" where time slows down and you get a view of the bullet as it kills the enemy is really satisfying. I also liked the inclusion of a sort of \"last stand\" mechanic where if you shot the guy who shot you before you died you gained health. Unlike other games, health in this game comes from Max taking a dose of pills. Taking a dose of pills will make the screen get blurry for a few seconds so it's best to try to heal yourself behind cover. Finding does of pills in each level actually was kind of fun. It's a reminder when gamers had to find \"health packs\" before games all went to a regenerative health system.The one drawback to this game is that there are some technical issues. I saw pop in and other graphical glitches, including some levels where the entire level would disappear and I'd have to re-start from a checkpoint, more often than I'd ever seen them in a Rockstar developed game. I also wasn't pleased with the MANY non-skippable cut scenes. I can understand forcing the player to go through each cut scene once because they are so vital to the story. But if I had to re-do a CheckPoint or entire level sitting through the cut scenes while the level loaded was really annoying.Overall, this is one of my favorite games of the year and one that I will replay and even try the multiplayer, which I normally don't do. I hope that Rockstar keeps this franchise going and we won't have to wait another nine years for Max Payne 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00C71034I","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381341 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A solid Batman game in its own right","reviewText":"WB Montreal had a big task taking over the reigns from Rocksteady, the original studio behind Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. The result is that Arkham Origins feels like a tweaked and polished version of Arkham City, with new voices, new gadgets, a fresh open storyline, a new environment, and other bonuses like detective investigations. The same great combat system that made the first two games great is still there largely untouched, just with a combat grading system and training area to help build you up for the boss fights and really become Batman at his prime. I've read some mixed reviews on the game, but as a Batman fan and action-adventure game fan Arkham Origins gets my approval. I've put a summary of the different aspects of the game below in some more detail. I plan to keep this spoiler free as best I can.StoryThe story takes place on Christmas Eve, with Black Mask putting out a $50 million bounty on Batman's head and 8 of the top assassins in Batman's rogue's gallery gunning for him. It's up to a younger Batman, in his 2nd year on the streets, to put an end to the night and take back control. This is Batman in his 2nd year, so he is still on bad terms with the police but does have Alfred to talk to for help and a full Batcave to train in. Having wrapped up the main campaign, I think it's overall a improvement on what we got from Arkham City in terms of game design. There were plenty of fun little twists and cameos that will make any Batman fan happy to see. I really liked that you had pretty much free reign to run around and tackle challenges as you please, and just stop what you're doing and tackle an ongoing crime if you wanted to. There's lots of side stuff to do for the Batman fans/completionists. One thing that is kind of jarring is that there's no one but criminals out on the streets, nor any traffic at all. It would have been great to see some life in the city, but they put in a plot device to explain that.GameplayDoes this game make you feel like you're Batman? Absolutely! The combat system is just fantastic - easy for a beginner to pick up and enjoy and deep enough for a enthusiast to dive into. It's what you know and love from the previous Batman games, just with some new enemy types like Brutes that take a beating and Ninja's that can counter your moves. It adds a bit of new to the standard free-flow combat, but really isn't that different from previous games - which I think is a good thing.The big addition this time around are the detective-like investigations you can do to solve a crime CSI style. You get to pick up clues to recreate the events of a crime and put together where you need to head next/who to look for. Batman is supposed to be the world's greatest detective, so I think this part is a great addition.The boss fights are a lot of fun, and add a great deal of variety and involve different strategies to bring them down. The Deathstroke fight definitely felt the toughest though, but the other ones were fun too because of how different they were. The new gadgets like the remote-claw are fun to use and you can get pretty inventive with what you can do with it.Graphics/SoundThe sound design is great, about on par with what we've seen in previous Arkham games. The new voice actor for the Joker does a great job, and the new Batman voice actor isn't bad at all even though it's not Kevin Conroy. Batman has got a different sound to him, but still feels very Batman. The game's graphics aren't exactly anything mind-blowing. To be honest it looks like the previous Arkham Games to me. Not necessarily a bad thing since the framerate stays smooth and you've got a pretty big world to travel around.MultiplayerI recently got a chance to try out multi-player and I have to say it's a lot funner than I expected it to be. You get to either be Bane's thugs, Joker's thugs, or Batman and Robin. You get randomly selected to be the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder via a lottery system, but man is it fun to strike from the shadows while a war is going on. Even when you play as Bane's/Joker's thugs you can get the chance to play as the Joker or Bane and wreak havoc with their special abilities too. I had one crazy beat down match playing as Batman vs. Bane and lots of gunfire all over the place. There aren't many maps right now, but I'm hoping they'll add more soon enough. Multi-player has never been in a Arkham game before like this, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by it.SummaryIf you're a Batman fan, or a fan of the previous games looking to jump back into the Batman world - you can't go wrong with Arkham Origins. Even if you're just someone looking for a fun action game, I definitely recommend Arkham Origins. This game doesn't stray too far from the previous games, and I hope the next Arkham/Batman game really pushes for something new. But all in all, Arkham Origins is a solid game in it's own right.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004SWL9","description":"Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something likeMarvel vs. Capcom 2comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be. It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

This game, my first real first person shooter I ever bought and completed, was really enjoyable.  For a \"Greatest Hits\" game, it provides good value and good fun.  I appreciated it as a learning tool (yes I did it on easy), and as a game itself.There were some problems with this game though.  It tried to emulate an adventure and stealth game within a first person shooter.  This was done very poorly and destroyed much of the continuity.  This sometimes meant annoying backtracking, and pointless exploration.  Other times, it meant that if you can't continue unless you got a certain vehicle, or hit a certain button.  The stealth aspect is the worse.  I felt it was clumsy and completely arbitrary when a guard saw you or not.  Luckily, I downloaded a walkthrough, which reduced much of this drudgery.  Also, the vehicles are clunky, boring, and take away from the flow as well.Now to the good part.  While not a huge graphical achievement, it was still very smooth, and there was no clipping, slowdown, or bad camera angles.  Not stunning, but still, very polished nonetheless.  The controls were a bit tough to get use to, but if you haven't engrained yourself to the PC controls, the transition is not bad at all.  The auto aiming provides a bit of ease to it.The best way to describe the feel is to think of the movie Total Recall without Arnold or the freaks.  You're a revolutionary in the Mars mines, fighting your way through.  You travel through mines, caves, high tech buildings, hospitals, space station, and through water.  The scenery is sometimes chilling, sometimes peaceful, sometimes ruddy.  It all works well with the mood of the game.  The computer AI is decent (e.g. the don't run right into ambushes or get trapped in corners or behind walls), and the weapons offer a bit of variety.There are no real levels in this game, but about 70 load points to go through.  This provides a huge area to pass.  Saving can be done at any place, which is a huge, huge, plus.  There are only two bosses, so it's good to know it doesn't rely on the old tired gaming clich&eacute;.Finally, it has difficulty levels.  I'm new to first person shooters, so I choose easy.  Maybe it was a bit hard at some points, while it was a way too easy at most other points, but it's better than being frustrated beyond belief.  If you're masochistic or an expert, you can move up to a more difficult position.  Either way, everyone will be satisfied.This game also has the standard multiplayer mode.  You can compete against another player, or against computer players.  The levels are fun, and it's good to get way to practice or get some aggression out.In short it's a very good game for everyone.  If you want a fun small adventure, choose easy and download a walkthrough.  If you want a challenge, choose the impossible level, and try to figure out those little puzzle and stealths.Pros:Controls are not bad.Smooth and polished.Great Value.Large and varied environments.Cons:Pointless searching.Vehicles clunky and forced upon.Stealth base action clumsy, annoying.Difficulty not spread evenly.Time to complete: 15 hours (walkthrough and easy level).Difficulty level: Varies from really easy to really hard.Frustration level: Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2002"}

Johnson","summary":"Great game, strategy a bit lacking, but still a solid 4 star","reviewText":"I took a while to purchase this game, due to the fact the last game that got &quot;good&quot; overall reviews on here, turned out to suck (Unreal Championship).  I must say I really did enjoy this game.Basically in RS6. You assume the role of Ding Chavez, the leader of a 4 - man strike team.  You complete various missions that deal mainley with eliminating terrorists and saving hostages.When you first start this game, you will see that it is very similar in appearance to Splinter Cell.  This game effectively uses the aspects that made Splinter Cell so great.  The lighting effects are spectacular.  You can often look at shadows to see where your enemies are which is very helpful.  UBI Soft has again done an excellent job with the graphics in this game.  The levels almost look life-like.The sound in this game is good and way above average. If you have your XBOX hooked up to a home theatre system, then turn it up a bit to get the full effect of the various types of weapons.  One thing I did like about the sound though is that different guns make very distinct noises.  I especially love the sound of the .50 caliber sniper rifle and the USAS Automatic shotgun.  The sounds of the cities and towns you are in are pretty cool as well.  For example if you are outside in a town you can hear cars and kids playing in the street.  If you are in a bar in New Orleans, you can hear Jazz music playing through the speakers.The gameplay is also above average even though it could have been much better.  One VERY cool feature of this game is the fact that you can command your team using your actual voice if you have the XBOX communicator headset.  You can give your team commands like opening doors, covering, throwing grenades etc etc.  I am really suprised on how well the voice recognition worked.  I was expecting me to have to set up something to actually &quot;train&quot; the game to learn my voice and in fact spent about an half hour looking for an option to do that, but it does not exist.  The game does an OK job in recognizing your voice, which is pretty amazing in my opinion.  I have a deep voice but the game did a pretty good job in recognizing my commands.  Sometimes however, the game misunderstands what you say and does something entirely different or does not understand it at all and does nothing.  Of course if you want, you can always use the controller to give commands, but it is not as much fun as voice.  The only time I gave commands from the controller is when I ABSOLUTELY needed my team to do something because my life depended on it.  One thing that was missing from the gameplay is actually giving individual team members commands.  If you asked them to do something, then the whole team did it together, which is kind of corny.  So if you want your team to split up, then it would just be two groups; you by yourself and the other 3 team members together.The story line behind the single player campaign is just average.  While each level is impressively done, the story line behind it is not.  There is not too much depth in the story line and the final mission was bit of a dissapointment.I would have liked to see a bit more stategy involved the single player campaign mainley ordering individual team memebers.  Another thing that I did not like about the game is the fact you only get three saves per level.  In splinter cell, you get an automatic save when you reach a certain checkpoint, however in RS6 you are given three TOTAL saves per mission to use at anytime.  If you use your 3 saves just to get by one part of the mission, then you must complete the rest of the mission without dying.  A strategy I used was to save after an objective was complete.  Usually a mission has 2 or 3 objectives so this worked out nicely, eventhough I occasionally ended up playing a portion over and over again.  Another &quot;unrealistic&quot; but probally nessacary feature is that if your team members became &quot;incapaciated&quot; in a mission, they will be back up on their feet in the very next mission.  I take &quot;incapaciated&quot; to mean &quot;dead&quot;, so that is kind of unrealistic but I can see why it as done that way.  In my missions if any of my team members died, then I would just reload from my last save point, to keep the game realistic.XBOX live on this game is the best part of the game.  My favorite game and only game I play on Xbox live is Terroist Hunt, were basically you have a squad of 4 actual human players going through different levels eliminating terroists.  It is very fun and you can easily play for hours at a time if you don't watch the clock.  You can of course also give orders or take orders from your human teammates.  You can also play the single player campaign online where your computer squad is replaces with real players.  Other games on XBOX live include &quot;deathmatch&quot; type games, which I don't really play that much.  For the most part, the people on XBOX live who play RS6 are very cool and mature and not some snotty nose kid who doesn't know what their doing or just come online to act childish just to get attention.  I have met a couple who fit in the latter category, but that is it.Overall I am very impressed with this game.  It could have used a bit more strategy in the single player campaign, and also the storyline lacks depth. but other than this, this game is a solid 4.

This leads me to my biggest gripe with the game. The castle defense mini game that you are required to win to repel the attackers from your den. While the concept was probably good it completely took me out of the game. Worst yet they encounters are very hard and seem to rely as much on luck as any skill. The good news is that you can avoid these by watching your profile. Also you assign each den an Assassin leader at level 10. Once that Assassin reaches level 15 the Templar can no longer attack that Den. When you assign the Assassin it will unlock a special mission involving that character and then again at level 15. These missions aren't just fluff but are some of the more enjoyable missions I played in the game.All in all I was very happy with the game. It can take weeks to finish if you try to collect every pieces of the puzzle and complete every mini game. Or just a few days if you stick to the main story. The option is your and you don't lose anything really by not tracking down every mission. The characters are interesting and fun and they story is great. The short missions with Altiar add even more to it. This is supposed to be the last AC game featuring Enzio and Altiar but I if the quality of this game is a sign of things to come I look forward to fighting with the Assassins well into the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}

Games are mostly good. not many great games. A lot of the games are watered down ps3 ports and $50. cell phone style shooters with resistance and cod slapped on the cover. Also this system has cell phone game ports for too much money such as asphalt which is a 99cent game on phones and tablets and asphalt 8 for 99cents is a better game then the on on the vita. luckily killzone is nice and uncharted is out and that is a great game! Most of the good games are honestly watered down ps3 shovelware. PSP compatibility is cool because you can remap buttons to the analog sticks to get better controls out of shooters. The analog sticks aren't that good. I wish they would've went with dual slide pads instead. they get in the way to when pressing the face buttons. The speakers are average. The system and especially the screen are beautiful! The dpad isn't as good as the usual sony dpad which is the best dpad ever but it's still better then most dpads today. The start and select buttons are flush with the system making them hard to press. the back touch pad is a gimmick. some games overuse the touch screen. The battery life is excellent. i wish the console had tv out but no dice. If you want tv out you need to pay a lot of money for a modded vita from china, or you have to wait for the vita tv console which is gonna play vita games on your tv as well as stream ps4 to different rooms and be a media box. it will do everything the vita does in a console instead of a portable for $100. taking a page from the Ouya. There is no removable battery in the vita so you can't change the battery like in the psp. Memory cards are overpriced and required. I think that's it for now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000P297E8","reviewerName":"Tobie \"broadbandfreak\"","summary":"A Solid Game for Gamers","reviewText":"The game is unbelievable; simple as that. The storyline is rather intriguing how it is from a perspective other than Dante's, but it keeps Dante in the picture rather well as the story progresses. At first, it seems like Nero is an immature punk who is possessed with demonic power; as the story unravels, we learn that this is not the case. He does have a human side, and he does care, and he wants to know the truth. The mechanics of the game are awesome; thankfully, I purchased the XBOX 360 controller for PC and used that. This was the first Devil May Cry game that did not use pre-rendered scenes, nor were its movies pre-rendered either. This was able to push the graphics to a whole new level, especially with my Geforce 8800 GTS. The game never once glitched or stalled; the porting of it from console to PC seems flawless. I also liked the option to choose either DirectX 9 or 10 for Vista users (I always used 10, naturally). The soundtrack fit the game perfectly; the hard rock and industrial sounds gave it an edge. The game is split into two segments; the first part is Nero's perspective, while the second half is Dante's. When Nero is rendered helpless and needs rescuing, the player takes on the role of Dante and saves the day. Dante's part, unfortunately, is a little redundant, as we are forced to backtrack and cover the same ground that Nero had already covered. I think Capcom believed that this wouldn't bother some of us as Dante's mechanics and weapon usage are slightly different from Nero's. This part was boring to me, as I grew to like Nero's weapons and moves, and found myself disliking Dante's; this issue may have been due to the fact that Nero's moves and weapons were fresh and different from the traditional ones we've seen in the previous Devil May Cry games, while Dante's moves and weapons bring us back to those moments. The game ends well, and as always, it leaves it open for another future sequel. The replay value is addicting; the survivor mode has me coming back for more, and the weapon upgrades make the game much easier when used from the beginning. It can be rather irritating in the harder modes when a mob kills you and you have to start the zone from the very beginning, which could've taken you at least 10-15 minutes to get that far (there comes a part where resurrection orbs get expensive). All-in-all, it is money well spent; I'm not sure how the game functions without the XBOX 360 controller, but I can't imagine playing the game without it. I give the game a perfect 5/5 because any game that can keep my attention for hours at a time, and not bore me, is worthy of having such a score.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003Z0LFF6","description":"body {font-family:arial, helvetica, san-serif;}EXPERIENCE EVERY DIMENSION OF SPIDER-MAN","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"4.25 stars...","reviewText":"...but I had to give it 5 stars simply because I don't think that the game earns a 3.5-star average after 13 reviews.The game is just flat out campy fun.  The basic premise of the story (actually the whole nugget!) is that Spider-Man inadvertently destroys a tablet (the cliched \"Tablet of Order and Chaos\") during a fight with Mysterio, resulting in the shattering in the fabric of reality, placing 3 alternate universes in jeopardy.  All of the fragments need to be recovered.  Enough said, because that's the story plain and simple.The game begins in a tutorial-style mode where you get a taste of each alternate Spidey universe (Amazing, Noir, Ultimate, and 2099) and the first 4 fragments of the tablet are easy to collect as you are guided into how each universe differs from the other.  Amazing Spider-Man is probably the most balanced of the 4 between his ability to shrug off attacks and dispatch enemies with relative ease.  Ultimate Spider-Man has the alien symbiote attached to him, resulting in some rather fantastic rage powers and yet he has to contend with horrific villains.  Spider-Man 2099 is also well balanced, but does a lot of aerial combat as he falls through impossible heights.  Noir Spider-Man (my favorite) has to rely on stealth for take-downs; if he is exposed in the light, it doesn't take much to bring him down forcing you to evade and melt in the shadows as quickly as possible.  Noir can barely deal with one frontal confrontation with your typical lackey; he will get mowed down with 2 or more in his face.The story is not the best, but it's all about the campy humor, fun, and the web slinging.  So how are the gameplay mechanics?  In a word...awesome.  As you get slowly introduced into his abilities, you'll find yourself web-slinging around, web jumping, blinding your enemies with web pellets, performing web kicks, straight-up punches, etc.  It's pretty well done.Another cool aspect of the game lies within the \"Web of Destiny.\"  The Web of Destiny has a series of tasks for Spider-Man to complete in order to win additional Spidey \"essence\" (read:  points) so that he can purchase additional upgrades, abilities, etc.  It's very similar to the upgrade system in Batman:  Arkham Asylum.  It's also well done and leads to some rather cool abilities that Spidey can do.  It also breaks the montony of a button-mashing game, forcing you to take down a certain number of enemies a certain way, complete something within a certain amount of time, find a certain number of items, etc.  It makes you refrain from web sling, attack, web sling, attack, wash, rinse, and repeat.  It's clever.As for the camera complaints, I don't have any issues.  I'm able to navigate the camera with right analog stick with relative ease if the shot doesn't please me and I don't find myself struggling at all.  I'm a little puzzled at the complaints thus far - I have zero issues.My biggest complaint is when boss fights occasionally enter a 1st-person mode.  Seriously, if I wanted to perform hooks, uppercuts, and dodges like this, then I'll slip the PUNCH-OUT! disc into my Wii console.  I don't want it in my Spider-Man game.  The mechanics come across as cheesy and half-baked.  It seems like the developer felt like it was a cool idea and then realized it was too late to back off the stupid concept and left it in, with the embarrassing wave of \"oh, it does this, too.\"  In addition, while most of the levels are pretty cool, some are inexplicably frustrating.How does the game hold up overall?  Humor:  campy, but great!  Action/web-slinging:  well-done!  Voice-acting:  pretty good for the most part!  Is it a Batman:  Arkham Asylum contender?  Definitely, definitely NOT.  But it holds up to its own strengths pretty well and it's fun to play.Overall, I give it 4 1/4 stars but I'm giving it a full 5 simply because reviews thus far have been a little too harsh in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Great twist on the Sandbox genre","reviewText":"Being a somewhat older game for the Xbox 360 the popularity of this game has greatly diminished, despite that is a really an interesting twist on the sandbox genre. This GTA derivative puts you on the right side of the law. You are a genetically engineered supercop fighting the gangs within the city and your job is to rid the city of these gangs and their kingpins.As you go through the game getting kills your character levels up so to speak. You are able to level up your strength, agility, weapons skill, driving ability and explosives. Each one has its own distinctive advantage. With strength you are able to eventually pick up cars and even larger trucks. Agility allows you to scale buildings and jump very far. Weapons skill makes you more accurate and produces more damage. Driving ability gives you better control of the cars and even allows controlling of the car in midair. Explosives give you more powerful explosions.This is a pretty fun game as are most sandbox games, because they give you ultimate freedom and the ability to just roam the city looking for things. There are three main ways to play the game. You can go around playing the missions and fighting the gangs. You can roam the streets looking for agility orbs on the tops of buildings and the hidden orbs which level up all the abilities. The third way to play the game is just kill anyone and everyone you want, gang members and citizens alike. The problem with this is the peacekeepers (fellow cops) will start hunting you down if you go this route. More importantly you will lose the skills you have gained.My favorite parts of the game include: the superhuman abilities, which is quite a twist, the graphics while being cell shaded are pretty remarkable, and the fact that you can get to any part of the city whenever you want, no waiting until you've gotten to a certain mission. The best part of the game is unlike some of the newer hyped up big production games, this game is inherently fun. There is also a great depth to the city.Unfortunately, the like many of the other GTA clones this one also lacks a few key components that will always keep GTA on top in terms of depth. First of all, there are only cars (or trucks) that can be driven in the game. There aren't even any motorcycles or boats, which made me just want to run around instead of even bothering with a car and hitting pedestrians. Secondly, the game as I said before doesn't have a whole lot of side quests. Aside from hunting down gang members, you can look for agility orbs, hidden orbs or do the races. Other than that the game can be a little repetitive.After you level up all your skills, there isn't a whole lot to do at all. This is the curse of the sandbox genre. It is kind of like an illegal drug. It is immensely fun and exciting for a while, but then once the high is over, you feel unfulfilled. As was the case with this game I didn't want to have anything to do with it after playing through once. This game in particular lacked customization. There is no money involved at all. There is no garage to keep cars you own/stole. When it comes down to it, you own nothing in the game and you can't change your appearance or clothing. However, the game is just downright fun if you let loose, not caring about running over people or accidental friendly fire. Like very few new games these days it has the fun factor. I'd say I probably got a good 40 hours of playtime without getting every orb. In fact I spent over an hour just driving around at 150 mph in the agency supercar. Overall a good game worth buying--7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2008"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

Uhmm, no.  This game has great gameplay, but gameplay is only part of the game.  The rest is dominated by a horrible movie.  When I first popped it in, I was all excited.  Trudging through the fake weapons, the plot of characters I could care so little, the tired excuses to show artwork, just zapped all that.  The first two hours literally consists of 15 minutes of play.  No joke or exaggeration.  Of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg.  There are so many long drawn out interruptions that it ruined the rhythm of what would have been a good, though not great game.During the few interludes where you can actually play, you get to see a good game.  Even though I wish the movements and game was faster, it still combines many elements of platform, adventure, and first person shooter ups.  You have to use stealth, accuracy, thought, and quick reflexes to pass this game.  The very base of gameplay makes it enjoyableI do have some troubles with the controls.  First off, and this is picky, the X button should never, ever, be the abort button when it comes to the front end!  Every other game on earth uses it as the enter button to navigate menus, but not this game.  There are so many times where I was about to save it, only to be aborted for pressing X.  Also, swimming controls are just plain backwards and clumsy.  I struggled through the swimming scenes purely because of this.  Also, there are other things, like you'd be walking, and all of sudden you'd be flat against a wall just because you turned away from the wall.The general feel I got from the game was that all the effort was made to make it a movie, and then add the game as a side note.  There are only two parts, a ship, and a large complex.  The ship takes only an hour to finish, and the complex consists of about 10 structures that are pretty much similar.  That's it.  No complex environment, no contrasting views.

{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Red Steel 2 vs Kendo","reviewText":"A lot has already been written about this game so I am not going to repeat everything already said. I.e. impressive graphics for the Wii, best sword fighting experience in a video game so far, etc...As someone who teaches video game design, a researcher in virtual reality since the early 90s, and also practices kendo, I'm always interested in seeing how close today's games are able to mimic real sword play .Here are my observations:- The game allows you to parry and then immediately counter. This is good. However parry is done with the A button whereas you would much prefer bringing up your sword so that you can then fluidly counter, as in kendo. That said, there is a good reason why the developers could not do this. The wiimote is used both for wielding the sword AND for turning your head around. If you tried to raise your hand up to parry/block your viewpoint would shoot off into the sky and the AI would chop you up to bits.- The wii-motion-plus is not really fully utilized.  For example, sometimes in Kendo you'd like to gently push or strongly knock your opponent's sword (called a shinai) off center to create an opening for a strike. You can't do this in this game. The only way to really create an opening is to quickly side step. You also can't create an opening by feinting a strike. Like you can't raise your arm to suggest you are striking from above, and then on the way down you change trajectory and strike across the waist. Again, this is so easy to do given the motion-plus' capabilities.- I found that when I was striking, I did feel like I wanted to grab the wiimote with both hands as if I were practicing kendo. I also found I instinctively shifted my footwork as I would have done in Kendo. Though it isn't necessary in the game, it helps to achieve better balance during and after a strike.- Thrusting seems to work quite well if you do it in the way you would in Kendo. Move your sword forward minimally at the same time you move your body forward. Seems more reliable than extending your  arm out. Same is true in Kendo- your accuracy is better if you use your body to thrust rather than your arms.- There does not appear to be any vibration when I strike something- again something that probably could have easily been implemented and would have added to the realism.In summary: If you are ever wondering how close this game comes to kendo or if you are a kendo enthusiast wondering whether this game could give you some extra out-of-dojo practice, the answer is: this game does a commendable job but there's still more work to be done. Don't give up your kendo yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2010"}

Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it is a good game.  Devil May Cry is a fight and slash game with a haunting background and a terrible storyline.  It does work well though, and flows nicely.This game has some problems, but those are not problems that detract from the gameplay too wildly.  First off, it commits the greatest cardinal sin or all time - you cannot save at any point.  This immediately means that at least some of the game will contain repetition.  My second biggest gripe is the camera angle is situated at stationary spots.  It does not follow you around like other games.  Worse, is that when you move, the camera angle will switch to a vastly different view.  This ranges from inconvenient when navigating a room, to hellish when you're running and jump attacking a monster and the room suddenly flips on you.  I also thought the front end and menus were a little unintuitive, and the fact that you couldn't adjust the music and sound volume separately was also annoying.The game starts off with a bad storyline, and then Dante, whom you play, is placed into a dark foreboding castle, where the entire game takes place.  It's safe to say this background rates up there with Final Fantasy 10 and Ico.  You then fight your way through different small levels, collecting orbs and objects to advance to the next level.  At about the third level, you can choose which difficulty you can play.  With the easiest level, you can just hack and slash and special attacks will be automatically done.  In the harder levels, you can do those stupid random up up down A B L3 right down down combo moves that are in Fighter games.  Needless to say, I took the more straightforward level.The game consists of a little over 20 missions.  Some missions consist of moving from one place to another, others are a little more complex in that it requires you to gather an object and place it with an another, and some require you to beat a boss.  Either way, the missions rarely consist of backtracking, there is little wandering or not knowing where you are going, and there is a little repetition.  The movies are rare and skippible, so the action is rarely interrupted.  This means that the game has a great flow.All in all, it's a good game.  As a greatest hits game, it's a superb value.Pros:Haunting atmosphere.Which difficulty selected determines type of game.Great flow.Hardly any pointless wandering.Cons:Fixed CameraCannot save at any pointTime:12 hours (easy difficulty)Frustration Level:Low","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2003"}

Posey","summary":"First Impressions - Enslaved: Odyssey to the West","reviewText":"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a game that has been on my radar for some time now.  Not only is it one of the only non sequel or non remakes of Q4, but it's a story driven game.  The game actually has a writer who is known for such movies as The Beach and 28 Days Later.  Not too shabby, especially in the video game world.  So, it's to be expected that I was really excited about this game, the story buff (in video games at least) that I am.  Did Enslaved live up to it's high hopes during the first few hours of gameplay or is this game destined for B game bargain bins?  Read on to find out in my first impression.Enslaved: Odyssey to the West takes place about 200 years or so after a nuclear holocaust in the United States.  Vegetation is beginning to overtake structures and the world is beautiful in a despairing kind of way.  You play as Monkey, a strong brute of a man who was captured by slavers and stored on a slave ship.  In transit to wherever it is they were taking you, a girl breaks out of her cell and continues to sabotage the ship in her hasty attempt to get free and sets you loose.  The ship is coming down and you need to make it to an escape pod.  After some platforming, you eventually make it to the last escape pod, which is taken by the girl who caused the commotion.  You hold on for dear life to the escape pod as she ejects and you land in a desolate NYC years after a nuclear war. Upon awaking, you find that the girl, named Trip, has fitted you with a slave headband that shocks you if you don't do her will.  She can issue commands to you and you must do them for her.  If she dies, you also die.  So Monkey is a rough spot, but Trip isn't bad.  She did this because she knows she would never get home without Monkeys brute strength.  Her proposition to him, take her 300 miles to the west to her sanctuary village made by her father and she'll remove the collar.  With no choice in the matter, Monkey agrees and the two set off on their Odyssey to the West.And with that, Enslaved begins.  The opening sequence is very epic and the graphics in the game are some of the best I have seen on the 360 this side of Gears of War 2.  If you aren't familiar, the game is actually loosely based on Journey to the West, an old Chinese story that is apparently pretty popular in the UK due to some tv shows about it.  I wasn't familiar with it until I googled it.  Regardless, you don't need to know about the book to enjoy the game.  They use some of the same names and try to leave subtle clues to the book, but it's really a different beast altogether.The story so far is top notch and I'm really excited to see how Monkey and Trip make it to the west, but there are other things besides story in a game.  Namely, gameplay.  The gameplay is sort of reminiscent of a platformer like Prince of Persia.  There's a lot of climbing and swinging, but at the same time combat plays a huge roll.  You're going to be doing a lot of computer AI co-op to outsmart enemy mech's, the games most prevalent enemy.  For instance, Monkey is the strength, Trip the brains.  In one scenario, Monkey needs to make it across a huge area to take out an automated turret, less they be shredded to bits.  So, Trip uses her armband to create an electronic diversion that draws their fire.  That leaves you to circle around flank the enemy.  In doing so, you rip the arm off the mech and use it to finish off the remaining turrets.  But, the path you took here required a lot of jumping and swinging, something Trip can't do.  You need to go back and carry her on your back across hazardous areas and throw her to places she can't jump to.  At first, I thought it would be a pain in the ass, but I found I enjoy the times you have to carry her.  During these times is when the next thing I loved about the game begins to shine...The talking between the two characters is key in the game.  You never know when it will start or end, but they talk a lot.  It's in these times you learn the stories of the two travelers and what worlds they come from.  Without spoiling anything, they come from two totally different backgrounds so relating is a little rough.  Their banter is almost flirty in some regards so if you're into the chemistry between two co-op partners, you'll enjoy this portion of the game.  I found it refreshing and a nice diversion.  The world around them is crumbling but they have each other in rough times.I already mentioned it but the graphics are amazing.  The vistas and backdrops are truly breathtaking, especially when your ship crashes in the beginning.  Take a long look at the NYC skyline and be sure to keep your jaw from hitting the floor.  It's amazing and a true sight to see in a video game.  Plus, this is a post apocalyptic game that isn't brown.  How many games are out there that automatically equate post apocalyptic with brown, but in reality, after the fallout (if any) the world would be overtaken by nature.  It's nice to see this in a game.So far, I haven't had many complaints about the game.  If I had to point out anything I'd say that maybe the gameplay could get repetitive, but that's just me trying to find gripes where none exist.  There's an upgrade system that Trip performs that allows you to learn new combat options and new moves (as well as health and shields) that have the ability to keep things fresh.  If you like platformers though, you already know how those games can get after a solid gaming marathon.  It's something that comes with the territory, but most good platformers get around this by having varied level design, which Enslaved has in spades.So, should you buy this game?  Depends...do you like platformers that have heavy combat and some stealth scenarios?  If so, I'd say yes.  How about story?  I'm a sucker for a good story in a game so this one was a no brainer.  Enslaved could be a rent if you aren't too thrilled on the idea of platforming but be sure not to miss it.  This has the possibility of being a sleeper hit of 2010.  It won't compete in sales with the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games, but it's a new IP in a world of sequels and remakes.  Give it a shot so we can tell the industry we want to see new games, not just sequels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"The Pros & Cons","reviewText":"A lot of my fellow gamers have written a slew of solid (and for the most part, fair) reviews of the game so far, so I'm really just adding my two cents here.  I wish I could rate it a 3.5 instead of 3, because that's my honest rating of the game.I won't regurgitate the old Dragon Age canon from the first game, but comparatively speaking if you liked the more comprehensive feel of DA: Origins, you might feel disappointed with the current version.  The game is definitely more streamlined and seems more targeted for the broad audience, which may be good news for causal gamers or people who don't want to be bogged down with deep customization.  Hardcore RPG fans will definitely feel the shaft (as seen by the divergence in reviews even here on Amazon).  The way you look at weapons and armor has definitely changed, so be aware of that if you're expecting something like what you saw in the first game.  All in all, things are simpler, for better or worse.I also feel the combat system is hit or miss (literally).  Targeting enemies at times can be a real chore, and the camera is fussy.  Fighting a major boss in the heat of battle is already tough, but fighting the camera at the same time is a real bummer.  For example - fighting a huge dragon boss is awesome ... but not so awesome when the camera zooms in to some awkward position and I have to swing the camera around while I'm dodging attacks constantly because I need to get a view of where his tail is swinging wildly, etc.  From all the battles I've fought so far, I often find myself in the middle of a big scrum and dealing with the annoying camera and suspect collision detection a lot more than I would like to.  The hit/miss targeting gets annoying when you unleash a major attack, only to see it miss for no apparent reason.  And this issue is not limited to just the major battles.  Even when you are fighting low grade enemies, you'll often find yourself getting smacked from behind or other odd angles b/c of the awkward camera position and some people will find this a point of frustration, especially during the tougher fights.Repetition is also a concern, as many battles (at least as a warrior) ends up being a flurry of button mashing with the occasional special attack.  However, I do like how you can still swap characters on the fly and also set aside individual tactics for the times when you want to let the computer run things.  (But I have seen many instances where despite making very specific settings - the computer just wonks out and ignores the order.  For example: I've set aside mages to automatically heal players who fall below 25% of health, and a lot of times they just ignore the order and people end up dying needlessly).  The numerous tactic slots are helpful because it gives you a lot of command scenarios that you can input, but after hours upon hours of combat, I still don't feel that it's consistent enough to be considered good (and this is coming from many instances where my folks die because they simply don't use the right spells or heal or execute the commands I programmed).Speaking of repetition - much of the game takes place in one environment.  In the interest of avoiding any spoilers, I won't elaborate further, but let's just say that as a player you should be prepared to see a lot of familiar sights, which is good and bad depending on how much you like your surroundings.  At least for the most part the visuals of the area look good (which I will touch on further a little later on).  However, I do not like the fact that some areas are virtually identical in terms of level design.  For instance, despite doing to different mansions for different quests - the layout for them are nearly identical.  The same goes for various caves.  It ruins the game somewhat when there is so much \"sameness\" ... even in terms of where the enemies spawn.But as for the good, I did enjoy the story and I like how it was told in a well-produced narrative style.  The cut scenes are well-done as well.  Right off the bat you know your characters destiny to some degree and much of it involves just having you lay out the path to that end.  The voice acting in the game (like in Mass Effect 2) is solid and it's funny to see some of the crazy and weird responses your character can make to other folks.  I also like how the main character now has a voice, which was not the case in DO: Origins.  Some people may not care, but for me I like it because I feel it gives my dude more personality.I also like the variety of sidequests and how it all plays into character development.  That's one reason why I've always been drawn to Bioware games ... the care put into storylines and why you really feel attached to some of the folks in the game.  For me, I really feel it's less a game sometimes and more of just a nice interactive movie that I'm a part of.  Again, hardcore RPG fans might be put off by Bioware's focus on the sizzle over the steak, but for me I don't mind it so much.Another plus (or minus depending on how much you liked Mass Effect) is the incorporation of the Mass Effect inventory/quick select wheel.  I find it helpful when it comes to selecting things on the fly, especially in the heat of battle.  But again, how you like this system plays into how much you favor the more in-depth system of old versus the new streamlined system in DA:2.However despite all the pluses I noted, I do feel that the limitations I pointed out earlier on with combat and customization keeps it from being a classic entry in the RPG world.  I know it keeps things simple, but for example, I'd like to be able to change armor settings for my NPCs.  It would be nice to have the ability to change the way they look as the game progresses.  In this respect, I think it just reiterates that feeling of \"sameness\" that I mentioned above when it comes to other issues such as level design.Nonetheless .. it's a solid game, no doubt.  And it will keep you entertained for a good 30+ hours at least.  If you treat it as a nice bit of visual eye candy, you'll be okay (the game overall looks better than DA: Origins, but some of the textures in DA2 look blurry or sloppy).  If you're looking for a deep, role playing experience, this may not be the best game for you.For me, this keeps me happy through the slim pickin' months of spring until more big titles come out!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Nearly A Wet Dream Come True","reviewText":"She has been summoned into duty once again.  The fearsome bounty hunter, Samsus Aran, has managed to find herself into another episode on the GBA, and I couldn't be more determined to help her blast away at the vicious, Metroid scum or the ancient evil that are the Space Pirates.  After the spectacular, simultaneous release of Metroid Prime and Fusion, in which I played hand-in-hand, my penchant towards the Metroid franchise has quadrupled.  Unfortunately, Metroid Prime 2 doesn`t have a same time release with Zero Mission.  Sigh.  However, Zero Mission is nearly a wet dream come true that has rekindled the Metroid fire and keeps it all the more robust.Not much of a departure from Fusion or even Super Metroid, Zero Mission keeps most of the aspects alive from the two previous installments.  In terms of gameplay, the regular, addicting hunt for Samsus's abilities such as the Morph Ball, have been implemented, and I'm presupposing it will always be like that.  First off, if you're a stranger to the Metroid series (other than a hefty shame on your part!), a brief synopsis of the simple design is as follows.The game is a 2D side-scrolling adventure.  As the bounty hunter of space, you are expected to explore the depths of the planet Zebes.  Usually delving into the underground and near the immediate surface, you must retrieve as many abilities as possible to eventually open up new areas and examine every nook and cranny.  Along your path, you will encounter several types of hostile creatures. Therefore, you will have to commence the assault with your arm cannon! Noticeably, there will be areas in which you deduct you may have access to, but try as you may, you will fail to reach them. Simply because you do not have the correct equipment such as, say the  Ice Beam to freeze enemies and use them as platforms.  Back-tracking is a huge factor, so as you pillage the caverns for several suit power-ups, you'll eventually face great, giant bosses. Don't get too excited though, the bosses are tainted with the description of being quite easy.  A piece of cake.  Big, dumb, and susceptible to a bombardment of missiles.Zero Mission's sad harmony notes play in the fact that it follows Fusion's detestable, short length. Other cool factors like Fusion's ability to climb hand-over-hand and gun down baddies has been eliminated.  I guess sacrifices have to be made, although I don't know what they were exchanged for.  Another thing is the difficulty altogether.  I know there is a setting of Normal and Hard, however the entire system behind Zero Mission is so dummy-proof I'm wondering if the creators were unsure whether the gamers of today can do it themselves.  Gamers require challenge (I`m praying we do).  We can think and explore on our own.  The Auto-Map directs you where to proceed.  It isn't no hint either, it's a downright command to go there.  It felt like playing Metal Gear for the PS1, where the Codec babysat me throughout the entire course of the game. All nitpicks aside, Zero Mission is genuinely an enjoyable adventure.There is a microscopic yet evident coat of paint added to the game's appearance.  Also there are some nice, hand drawn cut-scenes which are used to help bring out the plot (if it could even be regarded as one. . .). The entire atmosphere behind the game is animated well enough with great fluid textures found left and right.  The music and ambient sounds fill in the void with their distant and alien-like tones.  Clearly one of the GBA's best looking titles, Zero Mission's presentation shoots to kill.Gamers who solely play for 3D splendor will have to accept it, 2D will never die.  This re-make of the first Metroid game has its fair share of flaws (the duration of the game and the lackluster plot), however its brighter half will win you over effortlessly.  Following the footsteps of the simple yet genius formula, Metroid's latest offering delivers the goods. On its own merits, Zero Mission muscles to provide a polish that will surely give any gamer a worthwhile ride. There is next to no trouble recommending this to anyone who relishes their  GBA.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Curt Schilling's first game is a large but sprawling experience","reviewText":"I knew Curt Schilling the gamer geek long before I knew him as the soon-to-be Hall-of-Fame baseball player as I recall reading an excellent MMO review he wrote for PC Gamer magazine.  Apparently that was just the beginning as he got a loan and sunk a large chunk of his baseball winnings to create this game.  Reckoning features the stylings of former Marvel Comics artist (and baseball fan) Todd McFarlane.  Former Elder Scrolls lead designer Ken Rolston was hired to provide creative vision and bestselling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore was charged with writing the story.  With all of these egos working on one game, it's no surprise the game ends up big and huge.You are the \"fateless one\", or a soul born into a world where the future is not only predetermined, but even seen in advance by some of its inhabitants.  You are the first successful project in an attempt to reincarnate life.  While you wake up with no memory of who you were, your mere existence begins to affect the fate of those around you.  News travels fast and no sooner do you arrive when the facility that created you falls under attack.  You are soon thrust into the Faelands, a continent filled with strange creatures and a variety of landscapes.  Along the way you meet Agarth, a \"fateweaver\" born with the ability to see the future; except in your case.  A mysterious and scantily clad rogue named Alyn Shyr seems to have taken an interest in you as well.  In your quest to find the scientist who resurrected you and to figure out who you once were, you will need to decide whether to trust the advice of these strangers and do battle against the Tuatha, an army a winter fae currently engaged in a civil war against the mortal races.  Before your arrival, the fate of this war was already known.  Now a world where the future is inevitable suddenly becomes uncertain.If the idea of battling monsters for gobs of loot in a high fantasy setting sounds appealing, you'll enjoy this first release from Schilling & Co.  Be aware, however, there are a few rookie mistakes.  The most serious issue, at least for PC gamers, is this game may make you physically ill.  Prior to release, a demo showcased the first few levels of the game.  Immediately the forums lit up with complaints about PC gamers being unable to play for more than a few minutes before experiencing motion sickness.  This stems from a concept known as field of view.  In short, when you are viewing a television across the room, you are seeing roughly a 60-degree angle of vision.  Games developed for video game consoles are programmed with this in mind.  Unfortunately, this causes a problem when you attempt to play the same game on a PC monitor.  Your field of view is wider, usually 90-100 degrees, because your eyes are much closer to a monitor screen.  Unfortunately, this was not factored into the game's release.  For PC gamers it's rather like trying to play the game with your face pressed up against a television and you find yourself trying to, but being unable to, scroll the camera back.  Supposedly a patch is in the works, but seeing multiple DLC released before a single patch is not encouraging.Another common complaint is the game is too easy, even on its hardest setting.  It's partially a reflection of the trend toward extremely challenging games as evidenced by popular favorites like Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy.  In Reckoning's case, you can become very difficult to defeat without trying to exploit the game deliberately.  Weapons and armor become too powerful, too fast, and you will have more gold than you'll be able to spend in later levels.  Aside from the occasional boss monster you may find the game provides little challenge.The art and the environment of Amalur is rather interesting.  Large waterfalls and green forests in one area, sandy red rock deserts in another.  Huge sprawling castles and constricted dungeons with magical doorways.  It's all high-fantasy and somewhat familiar, but still nice to look at.  The soundtrack is cinematic and catchy but somewhat infrequent. The people you meet will ask for your help and spout a line or two on various subjects upon request.  You're never really having a conversation, though.  For all the voice acting, and there is an impressive amount in the game, it's rather like reading the Reckoning Wiki.Thanks to Reckoning, combat in starts to come of age in RPG's (and it's about time, frankly).  Wolves surround you and take turns attacking you from the sides while huge Jottun's throw their huge bellies around to resist damage and knock you off balance.  Enchanters fling spells at you from a distance and other monsters come at you with lightning, giant clubs, or poison tipped barbs.  As you kill baddies you alter and collect their fates.  With enough fate you are able to slip into \"reckoning mode\" as high-powered warrior with extra attack power and the ability to perform crunchy and satisfying slow motion kills while you rain death down upon your opponents.  Combat is Reckoning's biggest strength, and it's what sets the game apart from other RPG's.  It would have been even more effective if you felt much danger of dying.  Because of the relative ease of the game you may find yourself simply mashing buttons to move to the next character instead of learning each monster's attack patterns and weaknesses.  It's easy to fall into some bad habits simply for the sake of moving the game forward.After a while, the game's grand scale and many quests start to highlight the relative lack of variety.  There is no shortage of things to do and starting out I tried to complete every side quest I could find while exploring the areas for lorestones; collectable items designed to enhance the story and reward explorers with statistical bonuses.  I scavenged the areas for alchemy reagents and did battle with any enemy unfortunate enough to pick a fight with an experience-hungry warrior/rogue.  It was fun.  After a while, though, the quests started feeling mighty familiar and the towns started looking mighty familiar and the enemies... well, you know.  A month later and 80 hours into the game, things aren't much different than the first few hours.  Suddenly it dawns on me that, for all of the quests I've completed and the people I've saved (or killed), my actions have made no impact on the Kingdom of Amalur.  If, however, you're the type of person who enjoys the grind for the sake of grinding, whether it's finding a rare weapon, finishing the various faction quests, completing all of the game's achievements, or just a set of armor, then Reckoning may be the game for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Parasite Eve II is way cool....","reviewText":"Although this time around, PE plays more like Resident Evil than Parasite Eve.

On Sly's eighth birthday, he is given the Thievius Raccoonus, an instruction manual passed down through the Cooper family for generations on how to be a great thief. But ruthless villains bust in and steal the manual, split it amongst themselves, and then vanish. Sly, along with his two friends Bentley and Murray, must embark on a platform adventure to recover the pages of the book and prove to the world that Sly Cooper is the world's greatest thief. Different skills, such as stealth tactics and platform jumping, are required throughout the game. You'll also pilot vehicles, play minigames, and fight bosses as you proceed.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A great entrance to a memorable series","reviewText":"The Good: Colorful art style, solid controls and platforming, memorable characters, fun mini-games, gameplay makes you feel like a sneaky thiefThe Bad: A bit short, one hit and you're dead, some frustrating spots, cheap deathsI am not sure why I passed this game up all these years, but I am sad that I did. Finally being able to play it, I realize just how well it stands up today. Sly Cooper and his gang are trying to retrieve the Thievius Raccoonus which is a book of secrets passed on from thief to thief in Sly's family. The evil Clockwerk and several of his henchmen stole a page each, and it is up to you to get them back.The first thing you will notice about the game is how well it controls. The movement is buttery smooth with great platforming and gameplay  mechanics. Sly can double jump, but his main mechanic is his cane. He can use it to swing around and attack, but there are also ways to sneak around like a thief that just feel really whimsical. When you see blue sparkles on ledges you can hold circle and sneak around them. When Sly moves around a sneaking sound plays instead of footsteps which is really neat. This also goes for poles and other areas to climb. Just jump near it and hold circle and Sly will cling on. This mechanic is very well done and makes platforming a lot of fun. Combat is pretty simple where you just whack away with your cane and all enemies die in one hit. This isn't as easy as you think because you die in one hit too. There are traps and obstacles to avoid such as lasers and spotlights. Some times you will have to think a little to find a way around an enemy who is blocking the path.There are five levels and four of them focus around a central hub with branching mini-levels. There is a level to infiltrate each hub, and within these hubs are clue bottles to open a vault in each level. These vaults contain new moves for Sly which come in really handy. It is a lot of fun finding these bottles because the levels are pretty short and aren't too hard to find. Some levels are actually mini-games that consist of covering Murray on a turret, a dual stick shooter mini-game, or even a race. These are really hard and require quick reflexes or you will die often. Before you ask, yes there are lives in this game, but 100 coins gives you a 1-up, but other than that the coins are useless.The boss fights are really fun in this game, but also really tough. They require precise movement and patience because one hit and you are dead in this game. Yes, that sounds really brutal, but it is true. You can get magnets that act as free hits but these are pretty rare. In fact, that is probably the most frustrating thing about this game is that in just one hit you are dead. This includes falling in water or off a ledge. Later, in vaults, you can find a page that prevents you from dying when falling off ledges or in water which is a life saver (literally). Before that though, you will die dozens and dozens of times because there are some cheap deaths in this game but, because of how fun it is you will quickly get over it.The art style is beautiful with a cell shaded comic book look that wasn't really seen in games before Sly. The graphics look great even for today, but that probably has a lot to do with the art style hiding the lack of technical prowess of the PS2. The voice acting is a bit spotty, but it brings out the characters which is nice. I just wish I could have played as Bentley or Murray more. They are all great characters and need more time in the spotlight. If this game just wasn't so short and infuriatingly difficult in spots it would be perfect.Overall, Sly Cooper is a great entry to one of the best franchises ever created and is a pinnacle for the PS2. Solid controls, excellent platforming, fun combat, and a whimsical art style make this a must own in your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Good Times with Weapons","reviewText":"For seventeen years, South Park has entertained (and grossed out) a wide audience.  This isn't the first time that South Park has stepped into the video game realm, but it is the first time it's worked so well.  A lot of animated shows have had video game adaptations to mixed results.  The Simpsons and Family Guy had a lot of charm, but seemed to fall slightly short on the gameplay front.  The Stick of Truth is the real deal, however.  It is a game that comes together very well because of its charms.  Sure it's simplistic and easy, but it is also very faithful to South Park fans in such a way that you don't mind.  The Stick of Truth is absolutely worth playing.The Stick of Truth doesn't put you in the role of anyone in the cast of South Park.  Rather you create a character.  You are the new kid in town and your parents send you off to play and make friends.  Upon doing so you'll stumble upon the children of South Park who are in the midst of playing a game.  Your task is to protect the stick of truth.  The story doesn't sound like much... but this is South Park.  The story is portrayed as though the children are merely playing a game.  The reason all of this works so well and comes together so well is because this game, more than any other video game adaptation, really bleeds the game it was based off of.  There are no cel-shaded graphics going on here.  Rather South Park The Stick of Truth sticks to the conventions of the show itself.  The graphics look exactly like the show.  All the houses look like you remember them.  All of the characters look exactly like they do in the show.  Everything about this game looks exactly like the show to a tee.  It is well animated and plays out exactly like an episode of the show.Even better is the writing and voice work.  Matt Stone and Trey Parker did an excellent job with the writing.  The dialog is as sharp as ever and it's hilarious.  It plays exactly like an episode of South Park.  You won't find characters acting strangely out of character in any way and you will most definitely appreciate the many references to the show that the game has.  There are moments where the game gives you lots of references from the show as well.  Fans of South Park will be hard pressed to find all of them. The items are from the show and so are the descriptions.  The game, at times, feels like a love letter to fans who have followed the show for so long.  No matter if you stopped watching the show for a little bit or if you are just getting into it, there's something here for you to recognize.  That being said, if you are not a fan of the show I can't imagine you'll like the game at all. For fans, everything is essential South Park.  There are some shocking moments to be sure.  Things that you'll see here that you're apt to wonder how they got away with in such a manner.  You'll also find these moments hilarious.There are more than just references to the show here.  The game is more than willing to poke fun at and satirize the video game industry in such clever ways.  Since the children are playing they are free to comment on just how dumb some things seem.  It's clear that Matt Stone and Trey Parker themselves are gamers of some kind.The core mechanics of the game are simple in nature.  As you begin the game you'll have a quest log.that always updates.  For the most part you are free to roam South park to your hearts content.  There's a main quest at hand but you're able to stray from the beaten path to do others if you choose.  You can always &#34;friend&#34; the people of South Park as well to keep up with them and find out what other things you'll be able to do around town.  The main crux of it all, though is the turn based combat.  Stick of Truth employs a battle system very similar to Super Mario RPG.  When in battle you can select your actions.  Attacking is what you'll do the most and if you time your attacks and your hits correctly, you'll be able to score extra damage, combo your hits or use power attacks.  You can also guard against your enemies when they attack.  Sometimes you'll be able to counterattack.  It's a pretty simple system that won't allow you to get lost.  You'll have power points that'll allow you to use special abilities.  Making friends and adding them will give you perks that will help your abilities as well.There is nothing that really makes The Stick of Truth's battle system stand out aside from the charm of the characters in and of themselves.  Their commentary in battle makes them more fun than the actual battling.  Were it not for that The Stick of Truth wouldn't be a very rewarding game.  Battles are so simple and straightforward I don't think you'll ever find yourself in fear of losing.  There's nothing challenging here and it doesn't take a lot of skill to defeat your enemies, even though some of them may have moments where they hold up shields or riposte your attacks.  South Park may be turn based, but it does away with random battles and doesn't put a lot of emphasis on grinding.  The game itself is an incredibly easy experience.  This would be a huge problem if the characters weren't so enjoyable.  Battles also don't last too long at all.The Stick of Truth doesn't have a lot of depth to its battle system, but the charm of the game in and of itself makes this manageable.  The game is paced so well that the lack of depth never really becomes a problem.  A large part of that is also because The Stick of Truth is very to-the-point.  You won't be fighting a lot of battles that aren't necessary and the story doesn't waste time moving from Point A to Point B, even with a ton of sidequests thrown in.  The game is VERY well aware of what it is and VERY well aware of why you're probably playing it in the first place.  It is very rare to find a game that knows its audience so well, but The Stick of Truth most certainly does.Perhaps the only thing that sometimes holds The Stick of Truth back is that there will be times when it isn't quite obvious what to do to progress.  You'll almost always know where to go but it might not always be clear what you're supposed to do at your objective or how to do it.  Not a big deal.  On the other hand, some of the games moments might take you some time.  Though the battle system doesn't have a lot of depth, you will find yourself struggling with some of the timing for attacks at first.  The only time it's jarring is when it comes to some of the quick time events, which can be annoying.There are few television shows that jump into the video game realm and do it was well as South Park: The Stick of Truth.  Everything you love about the show is here, melded into a nice video game experience.  It's a game that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself or the game industry in a meaningful and hilarious way.  But best of all, it is not a game that slouches on what it gives you.  The writing and story are hilarious.  The game play is solid and the pacing is perfect.  If you are a fan of South Park you need to own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00C7103DO","description":"Batman: Arkham Origins features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel storyline set several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City, the first two critically acclaimed games of the franchise; Taking place before the rise of Gotham City's most dangerous criminals, the game showcases a young and unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight; As the story unfolds, players will meet many important characters for the first time and forge key relationships","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"So close, and yet so very far","reviewText":"DISCLAIMER:  I've fully played this game on both the PS3 and the PC.The short version:As a fan of both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I would have been perfectly happy with 'more of the same', and in many ways that's what we get in Arkham Origins.  Most of the game only slightly expands upon the previous two entries.Unfortunately, here we are 6 months later and its biggest detriment is still the bugs--not just annoying glitches but real show-stoppers.  If these could be ironed out, we'd have a 5-star entry in the series that lacks only a bit in the area of storyline and 'new ideas'.The details:Arkham Origins tells us the story of Gotham City prior to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City storylines.  What makes the story so wonderful is not only some excellent writing that really digs into the depth of Batman and the Joker, and reaches into the mob families that flesh out Batman's world in works like 'The Long Halloween' and 'Dark Victory'...but we also gain insights into a ton of hanging story ideas that were there in Arkham City, making the entire arc of these games seamless.  In Arkham City, you have clues that talk about Black Mask and he's never in the game--why?  Because we get his story here.  Why did Penguin refer in Arkham City to something Batman did to him?  Little details like this add to the magic.  Arkham City also begs the question, \"Why is everything in here blown up and ruined?\" and we get answers to that too.  In fact, it's pretty breathtaking the first time you set foot into the Gotham of Arkham Origins and it's not only whole, it's colorful and lit up for Christmastime.The beginning of the game establishes that right now the cops in Gotham City are really corrupt, and Jim Gordon is one of the few who isn't on the take from mobs and/or supervillains.  It also sets the stage for a mostly-empty city by saying a severe storm has forced evacuation...leaving us with cops and criminals wandering around looking for a fight.Unfortunately, the much larger territory and more open-world feel also take us away from a sense of the story's urgency.  Arkham Asylum walked you on a path to the final battle, and it was a big important fight.  Arkham City played connect-the-dots with the main story elements and its 'Protocol Ten' countdown really built the tension.  Arkham Origins hits you the wrong way at both ends:  storylines swearing you need to act fast aren't affected if you decided to wander around and explore...and at the same time, random police alerts go off on the radio and after the first dozen red-alert alarm calls you start to feel like stopping crimes won't make a difference because 30 seconds later there will be another one demanding you answer it...but not really meaning anything except lost XP if you don't.The Good:Combat flow is intricate and harder--you really need to take a more defensive stance and be willing to give yourself an edge by using gadgets.The achievement trees are hard to navigate because it appears that you have to knock out most of the achievements in order.The storyline does make the boss battles vary, though for the most part the combinations you use aren't any different from the prior games.We get some great dialog.  For example, (minor spoiler here) that first exchange in which Gordon meets Batman, that we've seen played over and over in movies and books, has Jim basically saying, \"We have a system!\" (and vigilantes don't fit) and Batman calmly responding, \"If your system worked, I wouldn't be here.\"The Bad:The PS3 version of the game strains under the load:  frame rate can get really choppy at times or the game itself seems to periodically need to take a deep breath between actions.Bugs can deny you an achievement.  They can cause the combat flow to come to a halt.  They can punish you for blocking because someone else got inserted in between you and your opponent.  An exciting multiple-takedown move usually starts with Batman popping up in the air, time slowing down...and then there's about a 50/50 chance that the move breaks and nothing happens.  Combat seems far too eager to take guy-with-knife and lock you into having to take him on head-to-head, even when you're ridiculously far away and moving further.  At least one bug has had me finish one of the hardest boss battles I've ever faced, only to be unable to leave the arena.  We've had major fixes released, but this one hit me again just last week.  More than one time I've had to reload a checkpoint and replay to re-earn what I'd rightfully accomplished.  And there are times when someone you're supposed to interrogate simply can't be interacted with--leave the area and/or reload.Really, given that 'more of the same' would make me happy, it's the bugs that make Arkham Origins such a disappointment.The Ugly:The PS3 version of the game is so unstable that I've twice had it freeze up a PS3 system that's less than a year old, completely shutting the machine down.It was kind of fun in the earlier games having to take snapshots of clues to answer the Riddler--that has been removed and I suspect it's because it was too hard or required too much Batman knowledge.  We don't have green question marks, so instead we collect green data packets.  Some of the data packets won't be there until you Interrogate one of the bad guys, which can get annoying when the packet in question requires a long one-way walk back through a level you've completed...and in one case the Interrogate suspect never showed due to a bug and I had to keep waiting until another time and checking again until he showed up.  Some of these one-way levels then require you to turn around and go all the way back to leave again.  It tends to turn things into a bit of a rote exercise, and that can be more frustrating when you realize that you're going to need to complete a large chunk of the main story just to be able to try your hand at the puzzles.  I won't spoil the game for you but I will say that one particular large confrontation turns into a nothing of non-battle, no exploration, just a tiny room and words exchanged.  The world is really huge, so they've added a 'fast travel' ability, but you won't be able to fast travel to an area until you've completely taken down a random scattering of items.  Last, playing 'New Game Plus' does NOT give you access to all of the gadgets you earned beating the game, but only those not central to the storyline...this is a shame because I really didn't want to repeat some of the boss battles and now that will be the only way to really get through the side stories, clues, and achievements.All in all, I loved the game enough to play it through twice, but I also found myself far more disappointed when things went wrong: it's like taking delivery of a beautiful Ferrari, only to find that the motor misfires and the Check Engine Light makes constant beeping noises.  So close, and yet so far...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2014"}

It is tough to turn and move with the controller, maddening.  Fortunately, THE DARKNESS II has corrected this problem.  But I am still playing the first DARKNESS game (near the end).  But be warned, I am a stubborn man.  In addition to the lousy game control programming, there are parts of this game in which you find yourself wondering where the heck you're at, how you got there, and what do you have to do to get back to \"normal.\"  There is nothing to compare to the frustration you feel when you are wandering around without a clue as to your whereabouts and trying to find your way to someplace you may not know.  It sounds stupid I know, but it's how this game \"plays.\"  The really good part of the game is the personal reward you feel when you have made your way past these hurdles and you know what's going on for a change.  Here's a short scenario of a portion of the game:  You walk into a place and -- wham! -- you end up in WWI trenches filled with zombies.  It's dark and how in the heck do you get out of this mess?  In this section, there is one point you end up in \"the hills\" in which lots of bad guys are shooting at you as you stagger around trying orient yourself.  There's no clear indication of what you need to do nor where to go next (SPOILER ALERT: You've got to climb a hill, find a cross and talk to a crucified man hanging upside down, get a couple key items, then find your way back to the village from which you wandered.)  Later in the game you're back in modern times chasing a bad guy across rooftop ventilation shafts...oh, those @%X@# game controls!BOTTOM LINE: If you have patience, like difficult puzzles, and have a modicum of dexterity, you'll probably enjoy this game.

However, for a player willing to overcome a few hardships, Demon's Souls is a well-made, well-executed, highly enjoyable game.Demon's Souls' basic gameplay is hack-and-slash similar to The Legend of Zelda or Kingdom Hearts, i.e. you swing your sword, block with your shield, roll, dodge, and so on. However, Demon's Souls has much higher stakes - your character can die in 2 or 3 hits, for one. Enemies telegraph attacks well enough, and are generally as weak as you are in health terms, so it's at least fair in that regard. It's less that the game is hard directly, and more that the game is unforgiving of carelessness; charging at an enemy as though they can be easily dispatched, like you would in most action games, usually ends up with your death.There's a fairly wide level of customization available in terms of gameplay choices, though. Souls are the game's currency, and are obtained from every enemy defeated. They are used to buy stat upgrades, spells, weapons, armor, and items. In essence, you have a fairly wide set of choices available in terms of how you play the game - as a direct fighter, as a lightly-equipped archer, or as a supporting magic-user. Your class influences your starting stats, but there are very few class-based limitations in terms of equipment and spells. As long as you've upgraded your stats to the right level, you can use almost anything.There is some difference in terms of what weapons are used, so there's at least a lot of diversity in terms of your character's development. In addition to enemy weaknesses, the weapons in the game also take how the weapon is used into account. Most directly, walls and corridors will make it impossible to swing a weapon - a problem if you're using a giant sword and can't get the room necessary to swing it. Generally, stabbing weapons like spears and rapiers are useful in close-range areas, while the giant swings of greatswords and polearms are useful in wide-open areas. It's possible to wield weapons one-handed or two-handed; it's also possible to dual wield weapons, to varying levels of effectiveness. The two kinds of ranged weapon are bows and crossbows: the former can be aimed manually, but requires two hands, while the latter must be locked on automatically, but can be used with a shield.Death in Demon's Souls is frequent, and comes with a few penalties. Upon death you become a ghost, with only 50% of your normal HP (though this is raised to 75% by an item found early on, which is much more tolerable). When you die, you lose all your current souls (but not items or abilities), but if you can get back to the spot you died in and touch your body, you can at least recover it. There are a few ways to recover your body, the most common of which is beating a boss while in spirit form. However, it's often not worth it - you can only beat a given boss once, and it's fairly easy to die afterwards to some simple trap or surprise attack. And given the number of things that are trying to kill you - soldiers, monsters, dragons, rolling balls, pit traps, and the occasional explosion - care should be taken at basically every opportunity.The game's multiplayer is probably its most innovative feature; rather than a direct sort of \"join someone else's game\" feature, Demon's Souls is more like a persistent online world where you can only occasionally interact with other people. The most common online interaction is messages. These messages are assembled from premade parts (\"look out for the ____ ahead\", etc.) and left on the ground near whatever they're talking about. Any player can put down a message, regardless of content, so it can be used to help people (\"there's a trap ahead\", \"don't trust this guy\") or to hinder them (\"if you jump down into this bottomless pit you'll get some treasure\"). Trustworthy messages can be recommended; recommending a message provides the player who put it down with an instant full-heal - something that's not to be sneezed at, especially during boss fights. Therefore, it's to the player's advantage to put down helpful notes, and the game is certainly hard enough to warrant them. In one case, for example, an otherwise innocuous NPC was marked with many runes nearby indicating that said NPC was a liar and I should attack him. As it turned out, the NPC was powering a ritual that made the level's boss immortal, and without killing him I never would have been able to beat said boss.The other way that the game presents a passively online universe is through player ghosts and bloodstains. The former is just a glimpse of other people playing the game - i.e., their characters running around in the same level you are in. These are mostly just there for show, though seeing a ghost pull a lever or break down a wall can provide a helpful hint. When another player dies, their bloodstain is left in the location where they died. If you touch a bloodstain, a ghost pops up and runs through the last few seconds of that player's life. This basically shows you where traps are in a lot of circumstances - you just have to watch for the part where the ghost \"dies\" when you go forward. In some cases, the presence of a great deal of bloodstains serves as warning enough.There are more direct ways of interacting, as well. When you're a ghost, you can offer your services as a Blue Phantom and enter another player's world as a cooperative helper. Beating the level's boss transports you back to your own game and gives you your body back. You can also take the darker path of the Black Phantom and invade another player's world; if you manage to kill them, you get your body back. Overall, there's not a lot of communication possible in-game. The messages serve as the only actual communication; blue phantoms must communicate with gestures and emotes, and there are only a few of these. There's no friend lists or anything along those lines, so you're really just grabbing any random player either as an enemy or a friend.The graphics in the game are excellent - the designs and effects are detailed and well-executed, there are plenty of incredible panoramic views (many of which can be noted with messages) and the characters all move with realistic weight and effort.  On the other hand, the Havok physics used in the game are completely ridiculous. Bodies, for one, can be easily kicked around by a player walking slowly into them, which causes them to go into humongous spasms and flail around. The sound is great, being distinctly atmospheric while also serving as a warning. The music is good, but only shows up for boss fights (in a manner similar to Shadow of the Colossus), while the rest of the game is music-less to let you focus on approaching footsteps or flapping dragon wings.As a whole, Demon's Souls is a great game with solid gameplay and fun online multiplayer. However, it's also a very unique game - casual gamers, people who dislike losing repeatedly, and people who want to play with people they know in real life are probably better staying away. The game's difficulty will drive away most gamers; even gamers who stick with it will likely find it frustrating when they die for the hundredth time. The online mode, while interesting and fun, is limited in its long-term applications due to the short \"pick up game\" nature of coop play.In conclusion, the game is a 9/10 for hardcore gamers, and a 6/10 for casual gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2009"}

NO MULTIPLAYER!!! Why, why? Why would the company do this? It even stated in my OXM magazine a couple of months ago that there would, in fact be online capabilities. This could have been sooooo much fun. I pictured the online mode just like Gears of War 2's, hence the whole game seems like a Gears of War knock off. There could have even been AI bots that you can face off against just in case you didn't feel like playing with real people at the time. What a missed oportunity. I really wanted to be able to choose sides. I WANTED TO PLAY AS THE TERMINATORS as well as the human resistance side. WHY!!!!!Now, a lot of people are ripping this game to pieces already. Mainly due to the lack of online multiplayer. While I do agree with them on that aspect, the actual single player campaign itself IMOP is very well done. To me, the graffics looked great. I really got a sense of an apocolyptic torn battlefield. You can see the Los Angeles war torn sky line off in the distance. The buildings are all rotting and falling apart. The character models look pretty decent, especially the T-600's. They look freakin' intimidating as all hell. Another problem is the lack of enemies. Not in overall numbers, mind you but that you only end up fighting maybe 4 different types of the enemy. Not enough diversity in that aspect. Another plus in favor of the game is that I did not see or come across any hicups. No frame drops or freezing of any sort. That to me shows that they took a decent amount of time fleshing out the kinks. The game is, however way too short. Why are more and more game developers doing this and charging $60.00 +. We as game consumers are being ripped off and need to stand up and do something about this. You would ask that with all of my gripes against this game \" how could you give this 4 stars \"? Well, because there is actually a lot of fun to be had here. You really get into some really intense firefights with Skynet. You actually have to outflank youre opponents. Also, its the Terminator and you really feel like you are in this \" end of the world \" scenario.

Along the way, you can collect a variety of weapons, accessories and souls. The souls can be combined for special attacks and abilities to help you on your quest. Just like the previous games, your character can level up and become stronger. Beat the game and you unlock bonus content/modes alongside the story mode, wireless mode and options. Save your progress anytime you walk into a room marked red on the map.The PROS: Konami did not mess with the formula as much and it plays exactly like the GBA Castlevania games. With the DS, you can look at the map or status screen on the top screen while the action takes place on the bottom screen and with new hardware comes with the graphical and audio upgrades. It looks, sounds and plays great so you will feel right at home. While you don't use the touch screen aspect too much, you now have to draw \"seals\" on the screen every time you are about to defeat a boss and on certain sections of the game, you need the stylus to clear the way for you. Beating the game opens up new modes and a so there is some incentive to go above and beyond.The CONS: Since it's the first Castlevania game to grace the DS, there isn't much they added that takes advantage of the DS other than the limited use of the stylus. When it comes to drawing the correct seal before the boss is defeated, the boss fight continues if you don't draw the correct seal and it gains some health. Thankfully, there is a mode during the game where you can practice how to draw the seals that you uncover. Also, there is no online connectivity because the game came out shortly after the DS made its debut. The Wi Fi Connection service hasn't been set up yet but the later games in the series took advantage of it.It's a great start for the trilogy of Castlevania DS games and while it doesn't add a lot of new things to the gam, it's still fun to play and just warms you up for the next two games to follow. You can get this used if money is an issue for you and if you're a fan of the series, especially from the GBA days, give this one a try if you haven't done so already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2011"}

They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power. During your adventure to complete your Pokedex and become the Champion, these two Pokemon, and Team Galaxy, will intertwine into the story and lead you on a fantastic journey across the Sinnoh region.When you set off on your travels, you'll be able to play as either a boy or girl Trainer.

If You Have, You've Been CONNED","reviewText":"This game is only for people that have NEVER PLAYED pokemon before. Only then will it be a decent game. If you've played pokemon before and just bought this because of all the new pokemon that came out and the new adventure etc etc, if that was your reason then sorry to say but YOU'VE BEEN DUPPED, TRICKED, CONNED, FOOLED!!Nintendo (game freak) sure got you. I'm not bashing their name for nothing, I'll list you all the reasons why this idea is indeed based on something.Slap a new name on an old game. Pokemon diamond is almost the same old game as when it first came out. Being on the new DS, you would expect it to at least upgrade its graphics and utilize the DS's full potential more. The only differences are: The towns look different, pokemon attack you more, different types of pokemon, different types of people, different bad guys, more tm's and hm's.1. POKEMON: Okay, in this game there are even more pokemons for you to find and....sometimes catch. But here's the low down if you're an analytical thinker. You see different types of pokemons right? But if you get to the basics of it, are they REALLY different or are they just the same old pokemons with a different look? Nintendo ran out of ideas for pokemons decades ago so they go into the pictorial dictionary of our earthly creatures and make a caricature of it and slap a goofy name that sometimes relate to the animals real life nature or...not..and call it a pokemon. They are so desperate to make up more pokemons that they brought in everything from dinosaurs to petshop animals to mystical creatures like dragons. Its to the point where its almost ridiculous to look at.Pokemon in this game seem to attack you a lot more, probably also based on ur abilities. Playing this game would drive you completely NUTS if you didn't carry a lot of REPELS, which seems to be the only real thing that works to repel those obnoxious wild pokemons. Sometimes you can take 2 steps and get attacked. Think about it, you're trying to solve a clue to get your way out of a cave and you get randomly attacked every 2-10 steps that you take. Just take a minute out of ur day and think of that for a second and see how you'll feel. Buy some insurance for your DS because I almost broke mines.I know cheating is bad but this game literally begs you to buy an ACTION REPLAY or other cheat device. Why? Because through half of the game they keep having you encounter the same small variety of pokemons. Catch'em all they say? How can you if 90% of the DIFFERENT types of pokemons almost throughout the game belong to a trainer?!?! You can set up your team however you want, but that's really limiting when you can only catch a handful of pokemon, especially old pokemon from the first game, even through half way in the game?! What is really fun is to be able to raise a pokemon throughout the game. Why would I want to find a legendary pokemon at lvl 50 when I'm practically done with the game?What I really really hate is how nintendo gives you a lot of pokemon like machop, gasley, abra in the beginning. They're nice but they can only evolve to their final form by trading. That is sort of hard, I'm 22 and I don't feel comfortable walking up to a little kid and be like \"hey do you want to trade pokemons with me?\" this is when a cop arrests me and I become a sex offender. I'm not crazy enough to play this online either.2. DS Utilization: Okay, the DS has a much better graphics engine on it, so why not use it? Pokemon Diamond could have easily been done on the regular gameboy. Use of the stylus? It's okay but nothing extraordinary. Sometimes its almost more convinient just using the buttons. Don't expect a lot of interaction using the stylus, its very badly incorporated into the game, to the bare minimum almost.Graphics remain pretty much 2D. For those of you that say DON'T FIX WHAT'S NOT BROKEN, that's the kind of attitude that makes you sink lower back to the caveman era. Don't fix it, IMPROVE IT.3. MISSIONS and PLOTS: SAME O SAME O. Old game with a new name indeed. Missions are basically the same, start in a town, objective to be the best, go beat gym leaders, beat the elite four, then battle tower etc afterwards.The bad guys are back, only difference is their name. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME. Same with your rival. If you were starting to get sick of pokemon emerald....this is almost the exact version so pick one and keep it.4. Battling System: EXACTLY THE FREAKEN SAME. NINTENDO, if you were going ot make the exact game and change it a little bit to trick a bunch of kids to buying your game and making you a lot of money, at least make the pokemon's moves look a lot cooler. The moves have a little more graphics in them but HARDLY anything worth mentioning.THIS IS WHY I THINK IF YOU BOUGHT THIS GAME AND YOU'VE PLAYED POKEMON BEFORE, YOU'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF REAL BAD. WHAT NINTENDO IS DOING IS WHAT THE MOVIE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DOING FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL. ADD A LITTLE STUFF, ADD A LITTLE SUSPENSE ON THE RELEASE, SLAP ON A NEW NAME AND BOOM, GULLIBLE HUMANS EATING YOUR TRASH.Get a flashcart everyone! You can put all your games on a memory card and play it on ur ds. Saves you lots of money!This is the only thing I can think of now but I'm pretty sure there's more complaints to be said. Oh yeah, you can't trade in your pokemon from your other pokemon games until much later when its almost useless.Be prepared to be pissed off when your pokemon that has a 165 based attack power and is 10 levels above a wild pokemon and still can't KO it with earthquake and its a normal effective move. THat's how ridiculous it is, and that pokemon has a 70 base def too...RIPP OFF!!!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The series takes a huge dive with RE6","reviewText":"The Good: Lots of content, fun co-op, varied boss fights, pushes the consoles to their maxThe Bad: Constant scrounging for ammo is frustrating, doesn't feel like RE at all, boss fights are tedious, poorly implemented quick time events, confusing story, ugly dated graphicsThe Resident Evil franchise made a huge comeback with RE4, but Capcom has abused this style of RE like they do with all their other franchises. Resident Evil 5 was already disappointing because it was too similar to RE4, RE6 takes it even further by making the game 100% action oriented, but trying to keep the survival horror elements of the last game. Either make it an action game or make it survival horror, you can't make it both. There are so many things wrong with this game that I couldn't even finish the second campaign.The story is about the C-virus that is being used a terrorist attack, I honestly can't tell you who did it or did I even hear Umbrella's name once through half the game that I played. This C-virus allows the zombies to mutate when damaged. That's great and all, but give me some freaking ammo to kill them with. This is the biggest issue with the game, there isn't enough ammo. I had to constantly scrounge for ammo like past games, but they throw 10-15 enemies at you and this becomes frustrating. I never had my max capacity of ammo, I always had half a clip in each gun then running around meleeing enemies until they dropped some ammo. Oh good, 5 rounds for my shotgun, it takes more than that to take some enemies down, so it's back to square one. I literally ran out of ammo at the wrong times and had to exploit the game to survive, that is not fun at all and is a broken game. Throwing three strong enemies at me plus a bunch of small ones with just two clips isn't survival horror, that's survival ammo.If that isn't enough, this game is meant to be played co-op only. The AI does a terrible job covering your back when you run out of ammo. They peck at the enemy here and there with a round or two and it can take over 10 minutes for the AI to take a large enemy down for you. I also found the quick time events poorly implemented and the animations for getting wounded are just awful and frustrating. Each character does this stupid drawn out animation that completely rips you from the game, when you get back up you get hit again, plays another long animation where you lose control, then again with another hit and your dead. This is so stupid and frustrating. Why rip the control away from me and play some stupid long animation that can't be interrupted?The boss fights are the most interesting in this game, but also the most repetitive. You will have to use the same strategy for every boss several times over instead of just two or three times before it is dead. The final boss for Leon's campaign needed the same quick time event performed 10 times. That is extremely tedious and not fun at all. As you have seen me explain each character has their own 4 hour campaign that explains the story in busted up pieces. It makes no sense, the enemies are silly (why do these zombies have guns, parachute from helicopters, and drive tanks?) and the new characters are hardly likeable. The story just didn't make any sense, sure there were few shocking moments, but why trudge through these four campaigns for it? At this point Resident Evil needs to go back to its roots and veer away from this action nonsense.There are a few modes like Mercenaries where you can earn more skill points. The skill system is terrible as well because I beat one and a half campaigns and only had enough skill points to upgrade three skills. It takes so long to upgrade these skills, what happened to the weapon upgrade system? That was a lot more fun. The game doesn't even feel like Resident Evil, but like an action game it isn't starring RE characters. Some times it felt like a setting from Gears of War, some times it felt like something from a generic sci-fi shooter. Lots of boring cement buildings, nothing interesting at all to look at. It doesn't help that the graphics are awful save for some nice lighting effects. The textures look like muddy stickers, and the game just gets boring and monotonous halfway through the first campaign.Is this worth playing at all? Sure, in co-op only because the AI can't cover you and is worthless. The quick time events are poorly implemented, the boss fights are fun yet repetitious, and the game is just boring to look at. It also doesn't help that it never once felt like a Resident Evil game, and the constant scrounging for ammo is just stupid. If you are a hardcore fan stay way, if you are a new comer stay away. Just go play RE4 or 5 one more time and wait for the next game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

Most younger gamers probably only know Pit as that one spammable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Considering that it's been over 20 years since Pit's last adventure, you might as well say that this game is a fresh new start for Pit.GRAPHICS: Last generation graphics, I know, but this game does look gorgeous. The 3D is thankfully not gimmicky, and it only adds to the flight scenes.SOUND: The score for this game fits, with an epic orchestra throughout. This game also has a lot of voice acting, which is unusual for a Nintendo game, and they picked some great voice actors, including that one girl who voices Lightning is Lady Palutena.STORY: What begins as nothing more than a throwback to the first game quickly turns into its own story, with some pretty interesting twists along away. The characters, both old and new, are very colorful, and the constant dialogue throughout gameplay just makes this game. The dialogue is filled with references to modern day life, other Nintendo franchises, and more fourth-wall breaking than an N64 Rareware game. That can be a downside, though. Sometimes, when you're in the middle of a fight, you just want to stop what you're doing to listen to what the characters will say next.GAMEPLAY: Most of the chapters of the game are divided into two parts, flight and land. The flight sections resemble a Star Fox game, with a limited path and plenty of enemies to shoot at. Depending on the difficulty, this can get very intense, with many enemies to shoot at and obstacles to avoid. Pit only has limited flight time, so soon you're dropped off to land. On land, it's your typical 3D action game, with an army of enemies, some treasures here and there, including a few mimics, a few secrets here and there, and finally the boss. While I like the flight sequences, I'm always eager to get on land, because this is where the real fun begins.One interesting feature this game has is its difficulty setting. The difficulty can be raised with the amount of hearts (which is the currency used to buy new stuff) you have. It ranges from 1 to 9, and the higher the difficulty, the bigger the reward. However, every time you die, the difficulty goes down, so make sure you can handle a high difficulty first.This game has an assortment of weapons to choose from, including bows, staffs, swords, claws, and clubs. Each weapon has their own advantages and disadvantages to them, and you can try out the weapon before you equip it. Besides being able to buy new weapons, you can fuse weapons to make something new, so there's plenty to choose from. There are also abilities you can assign to Pit, although I didn't them too much besides the health recovery one.There are also a few unlockables, including challenges, which is sort of like the Kid Icarus version of achievements, and idols, which are like the trophies in Smash Bros, to keep you playing more.While this game is very enjoyable, it does have a few flaws. The controls, while not as bad as some people make them out to be, need some work, and the Circle Pad Pro doesn't help. The camera needs constant adjustment, and while can change controls around, you still have to use the touch screen for a few things, which can get annoying. This game can get a bit repetitive too, and to top it off, it's a pretty long game, for what it is. When you think it's over, it's not even halfway done. I played the game in small doses to keep it fresh, so it took me a while to finally beat it. Also, the bosses, while pretty fun, can sometimes be a bit underwhelming, many of them going down quite easily. But these flaws aren't as bad as they appear to be.Overall, if you're looking for a reason to play your 3DS, why not take a flight with Pit?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2012"}

New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Just another review of a stellar game","reviewText":"Super Smash Bros. Brawl really needs no introduction or explanation.  Most people who are even considering getting it know what it's about already.  For those who don't know, this is possibly the best game ever created.It's a fighting game, but it's nothing like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, etc.  You can have four players fighting at once over stages that range from gargantuan to puny.  There are tons of characters to choose from, and almost all come from Nintendo's most popular franchises.  All characters are controlled by the exact same controls (no need to learn all of the different button combinations or joystick rolls in complicated fighting games like Guilty Gear [although that's a great game as well]).  There are four special moves for each character, and then there are the standard attacks that the fighers have their own variation on.Double-jumping, crazy moves, tons of items, etc. make for an unbelievably unique experience that's different every time you play.  When I play Guilty Gear, I typically use the same group of moves repeatedly, because I know they work well.  In Brawl, you won't find such repetition because the levels, the characters, and the items will make each battle substantially different.  You can play against CPU opponents, or have you friends play aginst you.  either way, it's always going to be a great experience.There is an enjoyable single-player adventure to play as well.  Although it has some repetitiveness issues, it's pretty fun.  It lasts a good while, and there are plenty of interesting areas to go through.  But it still doesn't compare to the multiplayer experience.The online is a nice addition, but make sure you have a good connection.  I have experienced some lag before that can get pretty frustrating (unfortunately I have crummy internet where I live).  But when it's working fast it's really enjoyable.There's tons of unlockable content to find, from characters, to stages, to trophies.  You'll be playing this game for a looooong time if you want to get everything.This game is all about reflexes, so make sure you've got some limber fingers.  How fast you react and think to use the right move to counter your opponent is the key to the game.  So, if you like frantic, action-packed battles that can be enjoyed by up to four players, this is a great game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2009"}

You are going around from door to door and figuring out ways to get through a door and engage an enemy successfully. It kind of puts you in the mind of Metal Gear, except with a team. You order your team around and they help, tremendously. Most games I've seen that uses a team, their AI sucks. Socom comes to mind. Some of the firefights are intense. The enemy will flank you the best way they can. Plus, you can hear them talk, cuss, and command each other of how to engage you. Very realistic. This game is very good all the way around.

{"product_name":"B003O6KWZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Clayton J. Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Back From the Grave","reviewText":"I haven't quite finished the story mode yet, but it has an excellent variety of destruction.  Instead of just smashing your way through foes and getting a boss every three rounds, they've changed it up a bit with races, cage matches and smaller battles within larger maps.  The maps themselves are huge and offer various points of interest.  The cars, weapons and designs are all classic Twisted Metal.  Online, it seems to take forever to get a match going, but the matches are also varied and interesting enough.  There's deathmatch, team deathmatch, hunted, team hunted, a weird spinoff called 'nuke' where you catch the enemies leaders, sacrifice them into a moving meat grinder and get rewarded with a nuke which you can launch to destroy the enemy statues.  The atomosphere and music add to the calssic Twisted Metal feel, and gone is the over-brightness of older titles and the darkness of 'Black'.  I bought my copy at Walmart and it came with a free download of 'Black', so that was a huge bonus.  Basically if you like the old Twisted Metal (1 and 2) you'll find the turf familiar with a few new welcome surprises.  The gripes about this game seem to come from people who are fans of a particular version of Twisted Metal, expecting some great storyline out of a Call-of-Duty-with-cars shooter.  It's a fun game that once you get the hang of it becomes an instant favorite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

It suffers in reviews because it lacks the originality of the first and the huge gameplay leaps of the second, but nothing about this title is remotely buggy or broken. Lots of levels and environments to traverse, and Rare included some interesting scenarios this time around that mix up the normal 'run and jump' gameplay (reversed controls, riding a rocket that needs constant refueling, dodge lightning, etc). There are memorable boss fights and an overworld filled with secrets that is explored through upgradable vehicles. There's even a family of bears scattered across the world that will help you if locate the right items for them.Graphics are as sharp as the first two installments, and the music has a catchy, laid back tropical flavour (also seen in the brighter design of the enemies). The only nitpicks are the lack of story (Rare poked fun at this in the first two games, here they just don't try) and the character selection. It's odd that the series is called \"Donkey Kong Country\" and Donkey and Diddy are reduced to mere cameos here. Kiddy Kong brings back the heavy/light dynamic of the first game, but overall Dixie is still more useful and maneuverable. In the end though, this is a wonderful platformer that holds up well by today's standards. If you've still got an SNES, it's worth tracking down a copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"Typing this with sore fingertips and no regrets.","reviewText":"I originally wanted to pick up Rocksmith when it first released, but I dropped the idea after learning that at the time it didn't have anything for learning bass guitar, which is something I've owned for a long time but never really got deep into it.  Then about halfway through August, I learned that a bass expansion was finally released, so I made a point to go and finally give this game a shot.Five days and $70 later, I'm glad I made the investment.  Rocksmith is not only a technological revolution in the way players interact with music games, but it's a revolution in learning how to play a real instrument altogether!  The game comes with a USB-to-1/4\" cable that allows you to plug in a real guitar or bass to your console via USB.  Unlike Rock Band 3's attempt at throwing real instruments in the game or Rise of the Six String's flawed mechanics, Rocksmith actually works, and works very well!Upon plugging your instrument in for the first time, the game asks you what style of instrument you're playing--that is, what hand you strum with, what your head-stock looks like--and even has you tune the instrument for playing with the game.  My guitar-playing cousin criticized the tuner for \"not tuning it properly,\" but I believe for the core purpose of the game it really doesn't matter because its purpose is to show you how to lay the techniques and rhythms down.Like Rock Band, the game is set up as if you're going from gig to gig performing music.  However, it's a lot deeper than that.  Rather than throwing you immediately into a gig, the game allows you to rehearse the songs until you're at least minimally good enough to play the song in front of a crowd.  Also, you can unlock new technique lessons and more through rehearsing and even playing live!Speaking of unlockables, I can tell there is a whole lotta content to be had in this game.  Since at heart it's a music game for playing music, there's an Amp mode that allows you to turn your home theater into... well, a jam space.  Here, you can customize your very own tones using an array of different pedals with a variety of effects, and amps as well.  If you feel like being impatient you can pay $5 to unlock the non-rare pedals and amps, but what's the fun in that?!At the other end of the spectrum, Rocksmith knows it's a game and definitely never shorts the player on fun.  Bored of playing gigs and learning techniques?  Then put your current skills to the test by playing a variety of mini-games--all of which involve playing with your guitar or bass.  One such game is Ducks, where you must hit the ducks with the corresponding fret and string combination until time runs out.  It's very fun and addicting--in one round, I got over 100,000 points like it was nothing!  As a bass player my favorite is the Big Swing Baseball, where your objective is to swing the bat using bass-bending techniques.  It's challenging but extremely fun!My one complaint with Rocksmith is that it may be difficult to set up for your HDTV.  They absolutely stress that you not rely on HDMI output for audio.  My suggestion is to use HDMI for Video only, then use your AV cables for direct audio output to your stereo or home theater.  Also, it's recommended that you look into Optical Audio to avoid lag altogether.  If you're like me and enjoy the mini-games, it should be a necessity.In conclusion, Rocksmith is a highly enjoyable and educational video game.  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone with even a mild interest in learning to play music.  Advanced players might find themselves confused or frustrated with the layout, but for someone like me who was already familiar with the layout of a music game it isn't too bad to adjust to.  Give it a shot!(NOTE:  If you get this before October 18th 2012, you'll have to pay $29.99 for the Bass Expansion if you wish to play bass with this game.  The bass expansion is NOT INCLUDED with the original game.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}

This game looks and plays beautifully. And it has a sense of humor that ends up being a real breath of fresh air in a first person shooter. I was worried (after reading through other reviews) that this game would feel like I was playing a knock-off of one of the Modern Warfare games. And while there are similarities, these are very different games. The world here feels quite a bit more open and destructible, although the gameplay is still very linear. You will see very few areas that you can't venture into if you choose to. The weapons feel fantastic, as do the controls in almost every respect. The biggest drawbacks here are the linear gameplay, getting hung up on parts of the landscape (like trees), and the health regeneration shots you'll constantly be injecting yourself with, which take away from the otherwise striking realism. But these drawbacks do not make this a bad game. This is a very good game. If you're a fan of shooters, then you owe it to yourself to play this one. I would gladly play the campaign again.

The best improvement was the multiplayer options.  One of the portions was called Combat Training- It allows players to pratice with friends and/or AI bots.  This seemed to be a good way to get in a groove before going online.  I like some of the new weapons (though the setting is The Cold War).  The single player version in alright, nothing really amazing.  It was fun to experience the Vietnam setting; driving a boat, flying a chopper, etc., otherwise I didn't see a drastic improvement.  The zombies mode actually seems to be a little less exciting.  I beat the game on Hardcore and a second zombies map opens up along with the Dead Ops arcade game (The arcade game can be unlocked through the main menu if you get out of the electric chair and walk back to the computer behind you).  The graphics are ok, but they're not the best of the COD series and do not test the limits of the 360 at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}
